Entertainment These New Horror Movies Will Make You Scared Of Your Mom And Grandma The kids of The Visit and Goodnight Mommy try to figure out what to do when the monster may be inside the house possibly baking cookies. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Deanna Dunagan and Olivia DeJonge in The Visit. Universal Pictures ID 6854375 Seventy-five-year-old Deanna Dunagan is a scream in The Visit. Like you will scream. Early on in the movie her character referred to by almost everyone as Nana decides to join her grandchildren in their impromptu game of hide-and-seek under the house. She charges out of the darkness gray hair obscuring her face moving on all fours at an impossible gallop while muttering about how shes going to get the two kids scrambling to escape. She scares the bejesus out of them and out of the audience and then when everyone hurls themselves out into the sunlight she stands up dusts herself off and merrily announces shes making chicken pot pie like a Norman Rockwell grandmother crossed with something out of The Grudge.Like fellow creepy new release Goodnight Mommy its a housebound horror movie about characters trapped in a remote location with caretakers who may be out to get them. The unexpectedly solid giggly-shrieky The Visit is the latest budget horror flick from Blumhouse Productions as well as a modest much-needed comeback vehicle for M. Night Shyamalan. But more than anything its a movie rooted in the powerlessness thats part of being a kid. View this image > DeJonge Oxenbould and Kathryn Hahn as their mother in The Visit. Universal Pictures ID 6854382 Its young leads Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are assured again and again by the adults in their lives that Nana and Pop Pops (Peter McRobbie) strange behavior is just a side effect of getting old. After all theyre teenagers -- what the hell do they know? So even as their weeklong visit in remote Pennsylvania gets more and more alarming they stay put trying to believe that everythings fine.Like most main characters of found-footage movies Rebecca and Tyler are immensely annoying -- Rebeccas aspiring film-student blather may be even worse than Tylers white-boy freestyling -- but its at least in part because the format requires them to do some dumb things like sneak into the spooky basement they were told not to enter. Besides the fact that theyre grating has no bearing on their vulnerability in which they have to trust that a pair of strangers will care for and protect them because theyre family however estranged. Theyre good kids -- they dont want to alarm their mother (Kathryn Hahn) while shes on vacation and theyre trying to be compassionate to the elderly. So maybe Nana seems to go feral every night after 930 and Pop Pop keeps insisting he has a costume party to get to but thats normal old-folks stuff right? View this image > Goodnight Mommy. RADiUS-TWC ID 6854384 While Dunagan swerves between frail and affectionate and ghoulish and terrifying the possibly monstrous maternal figure in the Austrian Goodnight Mommy is aloof and in recovery from a facial surgery. She (Susanne Wuest) and her twin sons Elias and Lukas (Elias and Lukas Schwarz) are staying out in a secluded house by a lake in the woods. Sleek and modern covered with big windows on which the blinds are quickly drawn the place is a far cry from the Pennsylvania farmhouse of The Visit but the young boys end up just as cut off as Rebecca and Tyler roaming the area and keeping an eye on the bandaged woman theyre starting to suspect isnt actually their mom.If The Visit is a pleasant surprise Goodnight Mommy is slightly deflating in the wake of its own spectacularly creepy trailer though it summons up a steady sense of dread and features some beautiful unsettling cinematography. For most of its run the film directed by Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala keeps to the point of view of its main character wandering the forest with the children and watching them as they confer under the covers about their suspicions about their mother. Shes certainly...off with her half-heard phone conversations about no longer playing along her bloody eyes and her inexplicable impatience with one of the boys. Then theres that gleefully gross scene that may or may not be a dream in which the twins sneak into her bedroom at night and put a cockroach on her face impassively watching it disappear into her mouth. View this image > Goodnight Mommy. RADiUS-TWC ID 6854390 If their mother has actually been replaced by a stranger altered to look like her theres little recourse for Elias and Lukas who to the outside world are just children with a wild theory. The lone attempt they do make to ask for help finds them returned to the house with essentially a pat on the head. Whos going to trust two 10-year-olds with a story like that? Maybe not even the audience as we grasp the extent to which the films reality has been narrowed and filtered through kids with a limited understanding of whats going on around them.If the tension in The Visit comes from a thwarted desire for the movies young characters to call the cops run away or just get out of there the tension in Goodnight Mommy owes everything to our not knowing who to trust. Things dont always need to come rushing out of the darkness to be frightening.

Night Shyamalans foray into the genre of found-footage horror has the feeling of homework done well. Its fifteen-year-old protagonist Becca (Olivia DeJonge) a precocious documentary filmmaker and her thirteen-year-old brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) a nerdy rapper leave their home in Philadelphia and head to rural Pennsylvania to spend a week with their maternal grandparents whom theyve never met. The teens mother played by Kathryn Hahn eloped at nineteen and never saw her parents again; the movies found footage is Beccas documentary of the trip which is meant to reunite the family. However when the teens meet Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) they soon discover that things are amiss. The strange and fearsome doings owe nothing to the supernatural; rather Pop Pops furtive visits to a lonely shed Nanas nocturnal wanderings and the surprising outcome of a game of hide-and-seek lead to the childrens mounting terror. Meanwhile Becca armed with a batch of rote theories continues to make her film. It delivers a few jolts and a few tense laughs but Shyamalan stays on the surface and at a distance; his script is airtight and despite deft camera work by Maryse Alberti he displays no documentary curiosity of his own.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Sep 11 2015 Culture Negative reviews can be fun to read. They can also be fun to write. And few filmmakers have occasioned the writing of a greater number of negative reviews over the last decade or so than M. Night Shyamalan. Following his breakthrough with The Sixth Sense his underrated followup Unbreakable and the intriguing but not entirely successful Signs Shyamalans career has been in a seemingly bottomless free fall. The Village was bad though it looks pretty good in comparison to what followed. Lady in the Water was flamboyantly bad and The Happening was so bad that it could scarcely be reviewed only enunciated. Shyamalans fantasy adaptation The Last Airbender was terrible enough to instantly snuff out discussion of hoped-for sequels and his Will-Smith-family vanity project After Earth was the worst-reviewed movie of its stars career. Related Story Send M. Night Shyamalan Back to Film School and 10 Other Fan Fundraising Drives It is thus with some surprise--and perhaps even a hint of disappointment--that I must report that Shyamalans latest movie The Visit is merely mediocre. Its a modest undertaking and one with its share of flaws. But its not the breathtaking calamity that weve come to anticipate from its author.Begin with the fact that the movie is a horror-comedy. For a filmmaker so drawn to the fantastic (ghosts aliens floating arboreal toxins) Shyamalan has always been remarkably self-serious with the result that the laughs in his films--of which there have been plenty--have almost always been unintended. (Remember ""The Old Shed That Is Not To Be Used""? And ""I hear wind from outside""? Those were good ones.) With The Visit Shyamalan lightens up a bit and earns himself some much-needed goodwill.The movie is a ""found footage"" film taken by a sister and brother 15-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and 13-year-old Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) who are documenting a trip to see their grandparents. This is no ordinary trip however The two kids have never met said grandparents as their mother (Kathryn Hahn) ended all contact at age 19 when she ran off with a substitute English teacher who would later become the kids father and then leave her for a younger woman.The idea that a single mom would ship her kids off to grandparents theyve never met--and whom she hasnt seen herself in 15 years--is not the sturdiest of premises. (As the kids note presciently ""We dont know their temperament or their proclivities."") But at least the trip gives Mom the opportunity to go on a cruise with her boyfriend.Welcome back Shyamalan. We sort of missed you.Of course things start going awry almost from the moment Becca and Tyler arrive at the ""isolated farm"" where they meet their ""Nana"" (Deanna Dunagan) and ""Pop-Pop"" (Peter McRobbie). Its too remote for cell-phone coverage and the camera on the laptop with which they communicate with Mom via Skype is damaged in a freak kitchen accident. (Or is it an accident?) Nana and Pop-Pop tell the kids not to go in the basement--never a good cinematic sign--and to stay in their room after 930 p.m. But whats causing the nightly commotion outside the bedroom door? What is that evil smell emanating from the shed? And why is Pop-Pop carrying around that axe?The answers to these and other questions alternate between the theoretically frightening and the theoretically humorous and theory meets practice often enough to keep the film moving along. (For instance its a nice touch--equal parts creepy and comical--when Nana asks Becca to crawl completely inside the oven in order to clean it.) But it becomes a bit tiresome--and arguably insulting--when almost every non-nefarious explanation for the grandparents odd behavior is some variation on the idea that ""old people go crazy.""Shyamalan doesnt have much aptitude for the found-footage gimmick and his script gets weaker as it goes along. Both Becca and Tyler are given phobias--her mirrors; him bad hygiene--that they can dutifully overcome in the final act and the ultimate revelation behind Nana and Pop-Pops odd behavior is neither particularly plausible nor particularly surprising.Still there are good moments along the way and the movies ambitions are modest enough that it never goes entirely off the tracks. Until that is the very end when a melodramatic message-laden coda (dont hold on to anger...) is awkwardly affixed to the proceedings. Its a scene so false and preachy and generally ill-advised that it could be the work of only one filmmaker. Welcome back M. Night Shyamalan. We sort of missed you.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"The Visit returns M. Night Shyamalan to scary winning form review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Visit returns M. Night Shyamalan to scary winning form review The Visit is both funny and scary rescuing the dwindling reputation of filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan.Ed Oxenbould and Olivia DeJonge play teenagers Tyle and Becca whose grandparents behaviour becomes increasingly disturbing in The Visit.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Sept. 10 2015The VisitStarring Olivia DeJonge Ed Oxenbould. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Opens Friday in GTA theatres. 94 minutes. PG.M. Night Shyamalans latest film may well have been his last chance at redemption.Fortunately he rises to the challenge and makes The Visit good scary fun.Article Continued BelowAfter a string of recent failures that drew the scorn of critics and fans alike and belied the promise of earlier films like The Sixth Sense Shyamalan has found his footing again with a work that feels surprisingly fresh.Its also feels like a departure of sorts combining a strong comic touch with Shyamalans signature dark sensibility.The story is simplicity itself teens Becca and younger brother Tyler travel to the country home of grandparents theyve never met due to a rift caused when Mom eloped years before with a man they disapproved of. Becca is a budding filmmaker determined to make a documentary of the visit so both siblings are equipped with hand-held cameras to record events that graduate from strange to downright disturbing as it progresses. While this device has become increasingly overused in cinema it mostly works here.Meanwhile the kids stay in touch via Skype with Mom who tries to allay their fears over Nana and Pop Pops increasingly bizarre behaviour.Olivia DeJonge as Becca and Ed Oxenbould as Tyler get top billing and they well deserve it delivering appealing performances that exhibit a high degree of believability.Likewise Deanna Dunagan gives a fine performance as Nana drawing on our sympathies even as she grows ever more menacing. Peter McRobbie as Pop Pop infuses every gesture and facial tic with subtle foreboding. The script is unexpectedly loaded with humour including Tylers cheesy rap performances as T. Diamond Stud and his habit of substituting the names of female singers like Katy Perry for much stronger expletives.Shyamalan also takes a few gentle pokes at himself and other filmmakers via Beccas use of pretentious cinematic terms like ""visual tension"" and ""ironic scoring."" Even Nanas nocturnal activities as observed by the youngsters despite a strict 930 bedtime seem more amusing than scary at first along with the older folks inclination to point fingers at the others odd behaviour.Despite past lapses as a screenwriter -- e.g. The Happening After Earth -- this time out Shyamalans script demonstrates a fine sense of economy making every scene -- and every clue buried within -- vital to the outcome. Theres also a few well-placed red herrings. And Shyamalans trademark twist?

"Nights Vision An Outcast Director Returns With The Visit; Plus Digging for Fire Throws Sparks << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Nights Vision An Outcast Director Returns With The Visit; Plus Digging for Fire Throws Sparks Universal Pictures Movies September 11 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Itd seem impossible for a director to make a comeback if he was coming back from Lady in the Water The Happening The Last Airbender and After Earth. Whether you can make a case for these movies1 matters less than the wider stigma -- the vast majority is convinced they suck. Pair that impression with the general sense that their maker M. Night Shyamalan was some combination of Narcissus Icarus and posthumous heel-turn Steve Jobs and youre left with a portion of the moviegoing population actively rooting for someones misfortune in order to find pleasure in it -- a sort of fore-schadenfreude. As second lives go Shyamalans The Visit feels like a lot of things an emergence from bankruptcy a prison release extraction from a cult. The terms of his return feel court-ordered no glop no gas no environmentalist revenge paranoia no stars. Hes aligned himself with producer Jason Blum a man whose output mocks a word like ""prolific."" ""Pathological"" works better.2 Under the circumstances the name of Blums company Blumhouse sounds like a haven for managed reintegration which is basically the task before Shyamalan. Can he regain his form as a shotmaker storyteller and peddler of 11th-hour shock? And maybe more importantly can he stay out of his own way as he does it? Shyamalan wrote this movie about two teenage siblings who spend a week with increasingly weird grandparents theyve never met before. Their permanently heartbroken single mother (Kathryn Hahn) is taking a vacation with a new boyfriend and lets the children go to rural Pennsylvania to meet her folks whom she hasnt seen in 15 years. Its a stilted reunion. Doris and John (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) are sometimes mentally present and sometimes catatonic. They volunteer at a mental hospital but havent stopped by in a few days. Some of their coworkers keep popping over to check on them and the kids just shrug off most of the mystery. Throughout the movie the days of the week stamp the screen in a flagrant red font and the mounting anticipation makes you want to laugh. But this never inhabits the realm of comic dread. Its trying too hard. For one thing the kids are obnoxious. Part of that has to do with whats made a few Blumhouse assemblies hard to bear. The older one Becca (Olivia DeJonge) is making a documentary of the trip. So when things get spooky and she finds herself trapped in a bedroom or a basement she freaks out without letting go of the camera. Technically this isnt a found-footage film since the hours of handheld video are never lost but its the same formal conceit of movies like Creep and The Gallows. You can feel Shyamalan trying to make the most of a challenge -- the way on those cooking shows a chef can turn stale bread and two rotten bananas into a blue-ribbon dessert. Hes found ways to open up the format. Beccas brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) has a camera too. And at some point both siblings go crawling around under the grandparents farmhouse and in one shot you get a glimpse of a third person crawling toward the camera. It turns out to be Grandma Doris who claims she was just messing around. What makes that scene tense is the cutting between cameras a process so elemental I cant believe Im citing it as a surprise. But for found-footage that type of dynamic disorientation feels new. The kids have a laptop they set up to catch their grandparents doing other weird stuff. That device aligns the movie with the surveillance-footage horror of the Paranormal Activity series. And Shyamalan finds a way to do something effective with that too. But really youre watching another gimmicky film. This one just happens to be by a director who knows hes cleverer than most of the people who crank these things out. Hes still playing by many of the formats rules. This handheld business robs him of his natural gift for suspense-building and skin-crawling framing. The movie doesnt feel cheap. It just doesnt have the nightmarishness a more exactingly executed less on-trend movie would. You also have to put up with Becca and Tyler. DeJonge and Oxenbould are two Australians playing Americans who act like theyre on a 90s sitcom. Theyre bright and chirpy and aggravatingly talkative. Becca holds a snooty reverence for nonfiction filmmaking while clomping her way through one of the more confused home movies this subgenre has seen. She sits down for one-on-ones with Doris and when Becca promises her that shell be the star of the film the old ladys eyes get that Norma Desmond twinkle. Becca appears to think shots of her brother packing are more interesting than getting more footage of her grandmother sleep-vomiting. Tyler fancies himself a rapper -- he goes by T-Diamond Stylus -- and is prone to break into freestyles that end with ""ho"" At some point he asks Doris ""Do you know who Tyler the Creator is? Well I got that kind of sound"" which would be true were Tyler a lisping jester with choppy flow. But Oxenbould goes all the way in on the characters entitled bravura which the writing keeps softening for sympathy (hes been a germaphobe since their dad left) and comedy (when he means to curse he uses a pop stars name instead). That cursing device wore me down. Oxenbould does too. ""Jesus Becca. Im blind"" he says after seeing Doris scratching naked at a bedroom door. Hes selling this bratty part and I bought most of it. The whole movie feels like a director catching up with a culture thats changed since his movies were near the center of it a decade ago. Shyamalan really thinks white kids rapping is a cute novelty. While Tyler does his thing on the train to their grandparents house a black Amtrak employee beatboxes in his full uniform. For a moment I had to remind myself that Amtrak doesnt also travel back to Shirley Temple movies. This also feels like a director catching up with himself. Shyamalans back to the idea of horror and the broken home (theres a lovely shot of Hahn chasing the kids train while doing a mime routine that ends with her weeping). Hes back to The Plot Twist. The one here is hardly on par with the doozy of The Sixth Sense or especially The Village which was the most provocatively bonkers as a director Shyamalan is ever likely to get. It does turn a generically creepy movie into something more concretely frightful. McRobbies Clint Eastwood carriage veers closer to Robert Englund and Tobin Bell while Dunagans hamminess turns deviled fast. It was fun watching this with a gasping and screaming audience. For horror-goers the comparative competence must hit the spot. But theres nothing new here -- and what I sensed for 94 minutes was compromise a director who concedes that spending time at Blums house might be the first step in getting back to his own.  Ben Richardson In Digging for Fire Rosemarie DeWitt and Jake Johnson play an East Los Angeles couple with a 3-year-old son. Its a movie about marriage that begins as a plaint against monogamy. Not much goes on. With some directors nothing happening might occasion everything happening speaking micro-emotionally. Not here. Theres a lot of drift and small talk and flirting and carousing and that is that a Snapchat of chill-class East L.A. Shes a yoga instructor (the camera moves as though its at one of her sessions). Hes a public-school teacher. One of her clients has loaned them a sexy woodland cottage but they dont share it for long. Shes restless and frustrated with him -- he said hed do taxes that arent done; he wont take her familys money to send the boy to a good private school -- and takes the kid to her mother (Judith Light) and stepfather (Sam Elliott) while he stays behind to party and exhume the dead body hes certain is buried on the property. Hes already found a bone and a rusted gun which licenses him to play detective. Her fantasy of a girls night out dies when the other girl (Melanie Lynskey) has to cancel. She winds up having dinner with a handsome stranger. Johnson wrote the script with the director Joe Swanberg and theres a loose searching dimension to this movie that makes it easy to watch. The actors that traipse through dont hurt either. There are parts for Anna Kendrick Sam Rockwell Brie Larson Mike Birbiglia Chris Messina Ron Livingston Orlando Bloom Jenny Slate and Jane Adams some of whom Swanbergs directed before. But the movie lasts for only 85 minutes and thats not enough time for any particular feeling or idea to cling. Theres so much hunting here not just for a corpse but for a movie. At 34 this is where Swanberg is. He began by doing lo-fi hangouts and 10 years and 17 or so movies later some kind of self-guided sensibility has begun to announce itself. Hes more comfortable now with story structure and characters and performances. The moment in which Lynskey breaks the news to DeWitt -- nervously with little eye contact -- is lovely and DeWitts work seems headed somewhere more trenchant than the warm familiar place the character eventually winds up. Its just still hard to say why Swanberg is directing. Its not for money or glory or even the cool of it (though hes certainly attained that last one among a chic class of Los Angeles movie people). This is the most concentrated and conventional thing hes done and its difficult to tell whether hes losing or finding himself. The movie has been dedicated to Paul Mazursky the great radiologist of American social interplay who died last year. But Swanberg is still murmuring where Mazursky could speechify gesticulate and shout sometimes in the same sequence. Hopefully Mazurskys name is more than a dedication for Swanberg. Its a standard to meet a beacon to follow. I actually like Lady in the Water and the earnest anger of The Happening is fascinating before its embarrassing.Twenty-three productions in the past year and a half the majority of them low-budget high-profit horror.

Night Shyamalanas The Visit Actually Works By David Edelstein Shyamalan has come up with an unoriginal <i>faux</i>-doc horror picture that actually works. 1k Shares Share 1k Tweet 19 Share 1 Share Email Print Share Photo Universal Pictures Somewhat slowing his slide into irrelevance ""the next Spielberg"" (loco citatoA NewsweekA -- emphasis onA loco) M. Night Shyamalan has come up with an unoriginal faux-doc horror picture that actually works like a demonic charm. The VisitA centers on two kids -- 15-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge) a fledgling filmmaker and 8-year-old Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) a fledgling rapper and full-fledged smartass -- who travel to their grandparents rural Pennsylvania farm. From the outset the Shyamsters themes make your nostrils twitch with the scent of significance. The kids single mom (Kathryn Hahn) left home as a teenager under murky circumstances and hasnt communicated with her parents for 15 years. So the grandparents dont know the kids. The kids dont know the grandparents. And the kids have only elected to make the eponymous visit (following an out-of-the-blue invitation from their ""Nana"" and ""Pop Pop"") because they want their mother to have a week to bond with the latest in a line of Mr. Rights since their despised father decamped. ""Were doing this so mom can have a life"" Becca reminds her brother. You see the issue. The family has been fractured on every level and in a genre as fundamentally conservative as horror such fractures offer a place for demons to nest. Even stable families can come apart when the bodies and minds of the more aged members begin to fail. Now for a non-spoiler If those grandparents -- played by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie -- were normal then this wouldnt be a horror movie. So theyre not and this is. But what is the nature of their malady? Becca who has chosen to make a documentary about the visit attempts to interview her Nana on the subject of her mothers estrangement. The question causes Nanas head to gyrate madly. Other questions emerge Whats in the shed? Whats in the cellar? Why is Nana staggering through the hall after dark night expelling vomit with her hair down? By way of explanation for the latter Pop Pop invokes the mid-stage Alzheimers symptom called sundowning. But he and Nana are still plenty creepy when the sun is up. The Shyamster couldnt be more obvious in his method and intent. Beneath all his pretentions (in The Narf in the BathtubA -- or whatever the hell that film was called -- he suggested that he was literally Gods gift to humankind) hes a B-movie gimmick-meister a less fun William Castle. Most of us can see The Visits climactic plot twist staggering toward us from far off trailing tatters of implausibility the way Kharis the Mummy trails moldy bandages. Along the way are Paranormal Activity-like hidden camera bits false scares sudden LOUD noises and a bunch more obvious tricks to make the audience shriek on cue. But the audience does. Dunagan is all in -- whey-faced blood-eyed her white hair hanging like a shroud parading her bare aged ass in what reads as an act of cinematic blasphemy. She has a great unnatural laugh. McRobbie is a bit more stilted but his hammy intonations somehow add to the eerie vibes. The kids are impossible to dislike. The running joke is that DeJonges ultraserious Becca holds forth on her cinematic ambitions -- in a clever Shyamster meta-touch she speaks of creating visual tension by hinting at things outside the frame -- while Oxenboulds Tyler impishly deflates her. His lisp is adorable. We dont want anything to happen to either one. Give Shyamalan this Hes not a cynic a nihilist or a cynical nihilist -- i.e. a filmmaker who leaves his monsters alive for no reason other than the hope of sequel money. The Visit has a rounded structure and a moral befitting a fairy tale. Its an obvious movie but a very decent one.

Night Shyamalan comes to his senses visit-deanna-grandma.jpg Deanna Dunagan is Nana in The Visit and shes kind of having a bad day ((UNIVERSAL)) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 11 2015 at 800 AM updated September 11 2015 at 810 AM comments Well heres an M. Night Shyamalan twist I dont think anybody saw coming and I know nobody is going to mind. He made a good movie again. ""The Visit"" is a deceptively simple story about two adolescents meeting their grandparents for the first time. Moms a little worried about sending the kids off alone - shes been estranged from her parents since she left home - but she thinks the teens will enjoy it. And they do for a while. Until Nana starts wandering the house at night. Pop Pop spends an awful lot of time out in the shed doing... something. And - well heres a hint kids. If you ever feel like youre in a horror movie? And somebody warns you Dont go in the basement? Please dont go in the basement. Despite plenty of familiar moments ""The Visit"" still has surprises - including the traditional Shyamalan third-act fake-out. The real shock though is how brightly hes rekindled his talent. His last two big-budget films - ""After Earth"" and ""The Last Airbender"" - were almost aggressively bad. And although many of his movies made money - thats how he could keep making them - who wants to see ""The Village"" again? (Hey even Mark Wahlberg thought ""The Happening"" was a mistake and Mark Wahlberg made ""Ted 2."") Guessing perhaps that too much money and hype and Hollywood were the problems Shyamalan decided to get basic - an under-the-radar shoot one setting (except for a prologue and epilogue) no real special effects and only five actors (the biggest name of which is Kathryn Hahn who appears briefly as the childrens mother.) And all of it works. The children -- Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould - are legitimately gifted. And as the oddball elders veteran character actors Deanna Dunagan - who is absolutely fearless - and Peter McRobbie keep the terror at a low uncomfortable simmer. Until things finally inevitably boil over. But while the production values are simple the script is sneakily complex. Like the best horror merchants Shyamalan exploits our secret fears - in this case of old age ill health and dementia. And he both gives the children their own phobias - of mirrors of inaction - and then provides them with a way to conquer them. There are some occasional lapses in logic. The film is yet another one of those herky-jerky found-footage conceits (although less annoying than most) and it ends with a moment of forced familial uplift. And Im sorry but the last thing I want my horror films to leave me with is a feel-good fadeout. But heres something to genuinely feel good about This is M. Night Shyamalans best movie since ""Signs"" - maybe since ""The Sixth Sense."" And the only scary twist to that would be if it makes him so cocky again he decides to do ""Lady in the Water 2."" Ratings note The film contains violence nudity and some gross-out horror. The Visit (PG-13) Universal (94 min.) Directed by M. Night Shyamalan.

Brad Wheeler Contributed to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 11 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 11 2015 442PM EDT Comments AA Directed by M. Night Shyamalan Written by M. Night Shyamalan Starring Olivia DeJonge Ed Oxenbould and Kathryn Hahn Classification PG Country USA Language English I hear Hollywood whispers. I feel something is amiss. I see dead directorial reputations. And I smell a comeback.M. Night Shyamalan the maestro of the mind-blow hasnt been on a hot streak of late. We used to expect the razzle-dazzle of The Sixth Sense but he wins only Razzies now.With The Visit a pastoral horror comedy and found-footage family dysfunction fairy tale film-within-a-film fiesta a Shyamalan rebound happens. Its a genuinely fun affair - lets not write it off as a cult classic just yet - with the smirking air of a confidant and mischievous filmmaker. ""No one cares about cinematic standards"" says one of The Visits budding auteurs. Ha The story involves a young single mother - Kathryn Hahn who wonderfully skirts around the films edges but is vital to the movies every thing - who reluctantly parcels off her two teenage children to her estranged parents. The split happened 15 years earlier; the grandparents are strangers to the grandchildren. From New York off the kids go to rural Pennsylvania where they take to the family farm of ""Nana and Pop Pop"" like Norman Rockwell took to oil paints and turkey dinners. It gets strange though especially after 930 p.m. when things go bump scratch and old-people naked in the night.Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie are excellent at creepy - better than Olivia DeJonge (as 15-year-old Rebecca Jamison) and Ed Oxenbould (as 13-year-old Tyler) are at being creeped out.Central to the movies structure is the film being made by the children during the week-long visit. Rebecca poised and intelligent is inquisitive about the family rift. The trip provides an opportunity to learn about the things her mother wont tell her.Her brother helps often as comic relief. Young Oxenbould is a precocious scene-stealing ham of a child actor. In The Visit he plays a precocious scene-stealing ham (and aspiring misogynistic rap star).The children have issues involving their imagined role as the reason for their parents breakup. Its a bit of context handled by writer Shyamalan in a shoe-horned way. More graceful are the fanciful Brothers Grimm allusions - the teenage Rebecca fits into a standard oven with room for a Gretel to spare.The creeping out slowly builds to a twist that Bruce Willis and Chubby Checker would approve of but the ultimate resolution has a bit of ""thats it?"" tidiness to it.After a late moment involves a rain- and tear-soaked blur of police lights and shivering people. Its a shot unlike the look and feel of the preceding 90 minutes - heavier scarier something from something rated R. A hint perhaps of the comebacking Shyamalans next visit.

Night Shyamalan finally redeems himself after a series of missteps (""After Earth"" ""The Last Airbender"" ""The Happening"") which undercut the promise of his early works (""The Sixth Sense"" ""Unbreakable"").Not that ""The Visit"" is any major breakthrough but thats exactly what its got going for it. Shyamalan gets back to basics -- make em laugh make em jump -- with a cast of nonstars in a spare setting and the tone shifts keep everything lively (or deadly depending on the scene).Fifteen-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her rapping younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are going to visit the grandparents theyve never met. A just-married Mom (Kathryn Hahn) stomped out of their Pennsylvania farmhouse at 19 and never returned. Now shes divorced from the kids father and wants to take a vacation and the kids are pumped to meet Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop (Peter McRobbie).So pumped that they are filming the entire trip. Yes its one of those shaky hand-held movies but Shyamalan still finds some interesting angles.At first things seem idyllic but a 930 p.m. curfew throws the kids. Especially when it turns out Nana is given to creepy late-night weirdness -- running around naked scratching at walls throwing up. And then theres the shed where Pop keeps all his dirtied adult diapers. Whats up with that?The initially plausible explanation is that theyre old people and old people do weird things. But things just keep getting creepier and creepier.Shyamalan pulls it off pretty well until he tags on a sentimental coda and a silly rap song ending. But theres undeniable fun in watching a couple of veteran actors get strange with two newcomers.

Night Shyamalan Olivia DeJonge (front) discovers all is not right with Nana (Deanna Dunagan). (Universal Pictures)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted September 12 2015The Visit from Chester Countys resident trickster M. Night Shyamalan is Hansel and Gretel with a shaky cam. Its a ""found-footage"" scare pic a slow-build affair with a few gags in which a teenage brother and sister hop the train from Philadelphia to spend a week in the country with the grandparents theyve never met.How can that be?Mom (Kathryn Hahn) seen mostly communicating via Skype in Shyamalans low-budget thriller left home when she was 19. Estrangement followed. The circumstances were dramatic even traumatic but shes not giving out details.Ask Nana and Pop Pop she suggests. It has been 15 years since she walked out. Maybe theyll talk about it.So off go Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) to a train station that says its Masonville Pa. (looks suspiciously like a stop on the Chestnut Hill West line) and to a secluded farm where Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) reside. Becca a budding filmmaker has brought her camcorder along - two actually - to document the family get-together. Tyler younger than his sis has brought his phobias and his rapping persona T-Diamond. Hes a textbook obsessive-compulsive ready to sterilize whatever surfaces hes about to touch. He also fancies himself a rapper improvising snappy couplets for the train conductors benefit. Tyler is obnoxious but what 13-year-old boy isnt?The week begins with baked cookies big breakfasts and smiles all around but after Pop Pop announces that he and Nana go to bed at 930 p.m. (""Were old people"") he recommends that Becca and Tyler do likewise.At the very least they should stay in their room.Let the creepy screeching noises and projectile vomiting begin.As the week moves along it becomes increasingly clear that all is not right with Nana and Pop Pop. Theres weird stuff going on in the shed the kids have been warned away from the basement (a mold problem) and several visitors from the town mental facility - where Becca and Tylers grandparents do volunteer work - come calling.When Nana asks Becca to help clean the oven it seems like an innocent request - until the sweet-looking senior citizen urges Becca to climb all the way in. (Dunagan looks like Lillian Gish circa The Night of the Hunter - another picture featuring children in jeopardy.)In the wake of two big-budget effects-driven flops ( The Last Airbender Another Earth) and two homegrown humiliations ( Lady in the Water and The Happening featuring some of the worst line-readings in the history of cinema) The Visit marks something of a return to form for Shyamalan. The filmmaker is looser here goofier. He has found a funny gimmick with Tylers substituting the names of female pop singers for curse words (""Katy Perry"" epithetically). And theres something amusingly pretentious about two camcorder-toting teens dropping cinema terms like mise en scene and denouement into their conversation.But The Visit isnt The Sixth Sense. Its not even Signs. (Although once again kids play prominent roles and families - even dysfunctional distressed families - matter.)And isnt the whole handheld ""real-video"" thing kind of old by now? Isnt the Shyamalanian-twist thing kind of old by now too?Thats not to say there is a twist as The Visit claws and scratches its way to its violent climax.Thats not to say there isnt one either.

EntertainmentMovies The Visit revisits familiar horror-movie tropes Originally published September 10 2015 at 300 pm Updated September 11 2015 at 924 am Olivia DeJonge and Deanna Dunagan star in M. Night Shyamalans ""The Visit."" (Photo Credit Universal Pictures) A review of M. Night Shyamalans uneven horror/comedy ""The Visit."" Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Just once wouldnt it be fun to hear a character in a horror movie say ""Wow that basement looks really scary. I am definitely NOT going down there. Want to watch Downton Abbey ""? OK so it wouldnt make for mesmerizing viewing but it would at least break up the formula. It goes without saying but I guess Ive said it that in M. Night Shyamalans uneven horror/comedy ""The Visit"" there is indeed something nasty in the basement and our intrepid teenage heroine Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) probably shouldnt have gone down there but did as everyone in a horror-movie script is required to do. Becca a budding filmmaker is visiting her long-estranged grandparents (Deanna Dunagan Peter McRobbie) along with her younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) on their remote snowbound farm and things arent going particularly well. Pop-Pop ominously warns the kids to not leave their room after 930 p.m. and Nana scuttles around the nighttime hallways as if rehearsing her interpretation of a deranged bat. Shyamalan has since his 1999 smash ""The Sixth Sense"" presented a wildly uneven array of films; ""The Visit"" veers him off on yet another direction that of campy horror infused with intentional laughter. Supposedly shot by Rebecca and Tyler (note the abrupt cuts and jiggly camera yet suspiciously professional lighting) the film unfolds quickly and mostly painlessly give or take a gross-out gag or two. DeJonge is funny and appealing as a teen reveling in the lingo of filmmaking (""This is the denouement"" she announces dramatically to her skeptical brother); Oxenbould is believably little-brother irritating; and Dunagan and McRobbie at least in the early scenes look to be having a good time hamming it up. Movie Review 1/2   The Visit with Deanna Dunagan Peter McRobbie Ed Oxenbould Olivia DeJonge. Kathryn Hahn. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. 94 minutes. Rated PG-13 for disturbing thematic material including terror violence and some nudity and for brief language. Several theaters. Is there anything fresh and original here? Not really though its amusing that Shyamalan whose work has been known to verge on the pretentious lets us laugh at a full-of-herself young filmmaker. In its later scenes though ""The Visit"" lets the laughs melt away and shows us two kids terrorized; its creepy sure but not very enjoyable basement or no.

"Visit The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; visit-the ) Visit The (United States 2015) September 10 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Two distinct problems of execution keep The Visit M. Night Shyamalans ""comeback"" from being anything more than another disappointing title on an increasingly uneven filmography. Despite a promising premise and effective ""Shyamalan twist"" this low-budget horror film still underwhelms. The Sixth Sense writer/director is his own worst enemy in the choices he makes bringing The Visit to the screen. Perhaps the first thing the viewer has to decide is whether or not to take The Visit seriously. Is it intended as a comedy/parody or it is meant to be a ""legitimate"" horror film? The laughs most of which are intentional argue for the former. Indeed for a majority of the running length The Visit has all the earmarks of a tongue-in-cheek satire. Unfortunately toward the end the movie undergoes such a dramatic tonal shift that whiplash is unavoidable. Its almost as if Shyamalan afraid that audiences wouldnt relate to his original vision abruptly changed course to something safe. It feels like a betrayal sabotaging whatever limited goodwill the first 75 minutes develops. As egregious an issue as that is its nothing compared to Shyamalans baffling decision to make The Visit an excursion into ""found footage"" gimmickry. For reasons known only to the filmmaker the movie is presented in the first-person point-of-view as outtakes from an amateur documentary. So yes this is yet another horror movie in which characters defy logic and always find a way to keep a camera rolling. Once in a rare while a ""found footage"" film figures out a legitimate reason to be presented in this format - The Blair Witch Project and the first Paranormal Activity come to mind - but for the most part this approach has become as disliked among genre adherents as with the public in general. With its shaky camera its more apt to induce queasiness than uneasiness. In The Visit its a constant distraction. Maybe thats the point - viewers focused on camera placement are less likely to ponder whether the narrative makes sense. Most of the story transpires in a rural part of Pennsylvania where Philadelphia kids Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are spending a wintery week with their estranged grandparents Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) so their mother (Kathryn Hahn) can go on a cruise with her boyfriend. Much is made out the fractured family history Mom hasnt seen her parents for fifteen years since she ran away to elope with an ""inappropriate"" boyfriend. The husbands subsequent abandonment of his wife and two children has left deep emotional scars that form the underpinning of various questionable dramatic elements. Shyamalan taps into the nostalgic memories and feelings many adults have of spending a week with the grandparents. Part adventure and part time travel these vacations remind youngsters that old people may inhabit the same world as them but are often a little behind the times and adhere to habits formed when society was different. Nana seems to spend every waking hour baking but her nocturnal habits are disturbing (to say the least). Meanwhile Pop Pop loves chopping wood but what does he have hidden in the old shed that in Tylers words ""smells like ass""? For a while The Visit does a canny job of poking fun at how horror movies put a sinister cast on seemingly mundane situations. At times especially early in the proceedings The Visit is a funny film. It works best as a satire and at least on some level thats Shyamalans intention. Most of the humor is calculated and not the result of bad acting or outrageously lame plot contortions. The director may have been trying to recreate what Wes Craven achieved with Scream - an effortless melding of dark comedy and blood-chilling horror - but the blend curdles and the first-person approach is sufficiently annoying to make it unlikely anyone will care. I have to admit that the twist got me. I wasnt expecting it and its sufficiently low-key that viewers arent sitting around waiting for it to happen. As clever as it is however thats the point at which the movie starts to spiral out of control. I couldnt help but wonder whether there might not be two better versions of The Visit out there each battling with the other for screen time in the theatrical cut and both losing the war of attrition. As for Shyamalans ""comeback"" theres always next time - hopefully without the ""found footage"" shaky-cam and schizophrenic tone. Visit The (United States 2015) Director M.

Night Shyamalans The Visit is one stop you want to skip Universal Pictures Olivia DeJonge in ""The Visit."" Olivia DeJonge in ""The Visit."" (Universal Pictures) Michael Sragow What if the rural couple in Grant Woods ""American Gothic"" stepped out of the painting to become villains in a gothic psycho horror film?Thats the black comic hook to ""The Visit"" M. Night Shyamalans ramshackle attempt to bounce back from the debacle of ""After Earth."" Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould play 15-year-old Becca and 13-year-old Tyler who travel from Philadelphia to some place called Masonville for a weeklong visit with their grandparents Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) whom theyve never seen. The plan is for their unhappily divorced mother (Kathryn Hahn) to go on a cruise with her boyfriend while the kids are in the countryside. Becca a precocious camera freak also wants to make a documentary about visiting her mothers hometown. She hopes to understand why her mother and grandparents have been estranged.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; Nana and Pop Pop seem pretty normal until night falls when Becca stumbles on a suddenly zombie-like Nana vomiting on her wood floor.The honorable tradition of American moviemakers wringing laughs and gasps from bucolic lunatics dates back to ""Murder He Says"" (1945). Unfortunately ""The Visit"" isnt part of it. Shyamalans script puts down reality shows but this shocker works on the level of a game show compelling audiences to yell out advice for Becca and Tyler as they steer through one trouble spot after another. This writer-director depends on hoary provocations. He fills the soundtrack with the creaks and groans of the family manse he hides secrets in a shed and a basement and he shoots a ghoulish figure speeding past a fixed camera a la ""Paranormal Activity."" This is largely just another herky-jerky ""found footage"" thriller though better lighted than most thanks to cinematographer Maryse Alberti. M. Night Shyamalan welcomes you to scream laugh during your Visit Jevon Phillips M. Night Shyamalan may not call ""The Visit"" a horror film but when two kids visit their grandparents home and strange inexplicable things happen after dark a little terror sets in.

Night Shyamalan may not call ""The Visit"" a horror film but when two kids visit their grandparents home and strange inexplicable things happen after dark a little terror sets in. ""The movie is entirely about playing on all of our fears -- both how we find them ridiculous and how were terrified... (Jevon Phillips) Shyamalan also tosses in red herrings like Beccas search for something she calls ""the elixir"" along with even redder flags so obvious youd think they must be satirical like having Nana and Pop Pop work as counselors at a psychiatric hospital. Until the final twist most ticket buyers will be too far ahead of the storytelling to squeal jump or laugh on cue.Sassy hyperactive Tyler a rap aficionado who uses pop idols like Katy Perry as curse words realizes almost immediately that he and his sister are in danger. Tyler is amusing when he raps about Nanas pineapple upside-down cake. (All the actors young and old are troupers.) But the movie rarely exploits the comical idea that Becca the family intellectual believes Nanas weirdness can be explained by sundown syndrome a state of confusion that afflicts some people with dementia. Review M. Night Shyamalans The Visit is one stop you want to skip Universal Pictures Peter McRobbie in ""The Visit."" Peter McRobbie in ""The Visit."" (Universal Pictures) Shyamalan has said he wanted this film to depict the healing of a fractured family. Divorce has traumatized both kids. Becca cant look in the mirror because of a bad self-image and Tyler has become a germophobe. But Beccas self-loathing hardly figures in the plot unless its the underlying reason why she climbs into an oven when Nana asks her to clean it from inside. Tylers neurosis simply lays the groundwork for a gross-out gag centered on Pop Pops incontinence.The directors big hits (""The Sixth Sense"" ""Unbreakable"") rely on two talents building an atmosphere of dread and creating grand finales that make audiences rethink what theyve just seen. In ""The Visit"" he veers haphazardly from brutal slapstick to heartbreak and lets his ending dribble into anticlimax. On the moviemakers own terms ""The Visit"" is sham Shyamalan.------------The VisitMPAA rating PG-13 for disturbing thematic material including terror violence nudity brief languageRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Kathryn Hahn Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-visit-movie-review-20150911-story.html,200,thevisit13,thevisit,latimes

BY Peter Hall NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 10 2015 600 PM Title ""The Visit"" Film Info With Kathryn Hahn Deanna Dunagan Peter McRobbie A single mom and her kids arent all right after a trip to Grandmas. Director M. Night Shyamalan (134) PG-13 Scares. Area theaters. M. Night Shyamalan has been a cinematic punching bag since at least ""Signs"" in 2002 -- and even more so since ""The Happening"" in 2008. But with the far more successful ""The Visit"" the director of 1999s ""The Sixth Sense"" has finally made his scary return to form. The biggest frustration here is the found-footage style thats attributed to a pair of likable teens. They want to document their first-ever trip to their grandparents farmhouse. The old folks Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) arent on good terms with their daughter known only as Mom (Kathryn Hahn). So Becca (Olivia DeJonge) aims to record everything in the hopes of her family achieving closure. But instead Becca mostly films her brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) goofing off as well as Pop Pops constant wood-chopping. Oh she also films Nanas nightly habit of crawling around the house on all fours stripping off her clothes and clawing at the walls. You know just standard old-folks stuff. Obviously something isnt quite right with Nana and Pop Pop. And the whole thing straps the audience in for a wheelchair ride straight to crazy town. But its the fun kind of crazy. And ""The Visit"" is undeniably admirably intense when it needs to be. Shyamalans previous feature was the big-budget Will and Jaden Smith bomb ""After Earth"" (2013). Now hes written a messed-up fairy tale that often nails the sweet spot between scaring us and letting us laugh at how scared we are. Its crowd-pleasing horror the kind that can push moviegoers to the edge of their seats and send them to the water cooler the next day. This ""Visit"" is unlikely to leave a ""Sixth Sense""-like dent on pop culture and it may have a few too many easy scares. But the movie remains proof that Shyamalan can still keep you up at night. Who could have seen that twist coming?

Night Shyamalans The Visit is here Does Jason Blum have a well-thumbed copy of Moneyball on his bedside table? Much like the subject of that book--Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane--the wildly successful Blumhouse Productions founder has made it his business to track down talented folks whose skills can be secured at a comparatively low price. For the most part Blum has done so by working with filmmakers who are at the start of their careers like Oren Peli (Paranormal Activity) James DeMonaco (The Purge) and Joel Edgerton who wrote and directed this summers utterly gripping The Gift. But the producer has also wisely chosen to collaborate with auteurs who are not as hot as they once were. That group includes Scott Derrickson who revitalized his career with the Blumhouse-produced Sinister following the box office failure of The Day the Earth Stood Still and now The Visit director M. Night Shyamalan Hollywoods onetime wonder boy who is in desperate need of a hit after a string of clunkers stretching back to 2006s Lady in the Water. Essentially a contemporary found-footage retelling of the Hansel and Gretel fairytale Shyamalans 11th film stars Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould as a pair of siblings who are packed off by Mom (Kathryn Hahn) to spend a week with their grandparents (Deanna Dunagan Peter McRobbie). Pretty soon it becomes clear that something is deeply wrong as DeJonges teenage documentarian uses her camera to catch ""Nana"" behaving oddly at night while Oxenboulds character stumbles upon ""Pop Pop"" jamming a gun in his mouth. What the hell is going on? To further elaborate would be to spoil the very Shyamalan-esque third-act twist in the film which the director also wrote. Suffice to say that the result is an effective scare machine and a semi-return to form for its creator. Certainly this is the first Shyamalan movie in a long time that viewers may be tempted to re-visit just to see how he pulls off his magic trick.

The Visit (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Visit (PG-13) M. Night Shyamalans return to horror is tiresome and contrived. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezmiamiherald.com9/10/2015 Editor rating 1 In his best films (The Sixth Sense Signs Unbreakable) writer-director M. Night Shyamalan was able to wring suspense and dread out of simple things a shape beneath a bedsheet a door being rattled a glass of water. In The Happening his widely reviled apocalyptic thriller the filmmaker built up considerable tension almost entirely through visuals (sunlight pouring through a tear in the vinyl top of a convertible a shot of trees swaying in the wind). Shyamalan is so good at priming the stage that when the end of the film doesnt deliver a large-enough wallop you come away disappointed. Audiences (and most critics) pounced on The Happening because the movies big reveal -- what was making people in the northeast U.S. suddenly kill themselves? -- couldnt live up to expectations and practically everyone shredded The Village for being a feature-length tease to a twist ending that didnt merit the buildup. But The Visit Shyamalans return to horror after disastrous forays into fantasy and sci-fi (After Earth The Last Airbender Lady in the Water) cant even get the setup right. This low-budget (5 million) entry into the found-footage genre centers on a weeklong visit by a pair of teenage siblings to the home of the grandparents theyve never met. Fifteen-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge) who wants to be a filmmaker and her younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) who fancies himself a rap artist are eager to meet their Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop-Pop (Peter McRobbie) even though their mom (Kathryn Hahn) who is divorced warns them that she hasnt seen or spoken to her parents in 19 years after she left home after an Incident She Cant Discuss. Most parents would be at least a tiny bit concerned about shipping off their kids to spend a week with people who are essentially strangers. But Mom is going on a much-needed cruise with her current boyfriend. So what if her parents live in such a remote area they dont even have cellphone service? Thanks to the magic of Hollywood (aka a cavernous plot hole) the kids will still have Wi-Fi reception and be able to Skype with Mom while shes off partying on the love boat. What could possibly go wrong? At first seemingly nothing. Upon arriving the siblings are greeted by warm doting grandparents who seem a bit flighty and have peculiar house rules (never leave your room after 930 p.m. do not go down into the basement) but are otherwise harmless. The central gimmick of The Visit -- one of the elements that gradually makes the movie insufferable -- is that Becca is filming the visit in the hopes of getting her grandparents to forgive their mom on-camera then turning the footage into a documentary. Shes smart enough to pack two cameras (one for her brother) which frees Shyamalan from being stranded to a single characters point of view even though this requires the kids to a) always be filming even when theyre crawling away from monsters or b) always be sure to drop the camera in a convenient spot that will capture the action even when theyre not holding it. Paranormal Activitys Jason Blum is one of the producers of The Visit which might explain why Shyamalan proceeded with the found-footage gimmick even though the picture would have been radically better if it had been filmed in a conventional manner. The first-person technique adds nothing but distraction and irritation and the cinematography by Maryse Alberti who also shot The Wrestler is way too polished and sumptuous to pass for homemade. Even worse The Visit is only half a horror movie The other half is intentionally humorous some of it lowbrow most of it so broad and grating that it makes you grind your teeth (the young Tylers precocious raps and antics are so profoundly annoying I started wishing the kid would get bumped off early Psycho-style even though hes just a 13 year-old boy). Here is another genre Shyamalan should stay away from comedy. But what ultimately sinks The Visit is that Shyamalan who had previously come up with new and ingenious ways to frighten us resorts to familiar jump-scare tactics in which things suddenly pop into the frame accompanied by loud sound effects. Theres no real sense of danger no menace Something is clearly wrong with Nana and Pop-Pop but even as their actions grow darker and more worrisome the kids continue to play along. By the time Becca is squeezing into an oven -- all the way inside -- so she can clean it for Nana you start thinking she deserves to stay locked in there until she grows a few IQ points. I mean who does that? The Visit has its moments like all of these studio horror pictures do but the climactic 15 minutes are particularly disappointing because Shyamalan doesnt even have a clever switcheroo to pull on us this time. Here is a movie in which old people are scary because theyre senile and icky and incontinent and do baffling things. And theyre you know so old and wrinkly.

Night Shyamalans newest movie The Visit. And no the film doesnt have the same break-pop-culture-in-half storytelling as The Sixth Sense.Whats more important about The Visit (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) is its Shyamalans best movie in years. The low-budget thriller deftly mixes horror-movie moments pure strangeness and comedy like a family-friendly David Lynch effort as it takesaudiences on one really oddball trip to grandmas house.Shyamalan toys with found-footage technique to tell the story of how Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) wind up visiting their Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) at their rural Pennsylvania farm. The kids have never met the grandparents the result of a falling-out with their mother (Kathryn Hahn) before they were born. Their single mom is off on a cruise with her boyfriend so the youngsters are shipped off to see their relatives.USA TODAYA peek inside M. Night Shyamalans notebookBut things quickly get weird as Becca documents with her ever-present camera. They find out that they need to lock themselves in their rooms at 930 a time that kicks off various bumps in the night. Is it the supernatural or a senior moment? Soon enough the kids are Skyping with mom about the stuff going on -- Nana wanting Becca to climb into the oven and clean it from the inside (a nice allusion to the Brothers Grimm) and Pop Pep getting a little too close with the business end of a rifle while cleaning out. And things only spiral downhill from there.Shyamalan has always had a knack for casting kids well (see Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense) and while their characters could easily be too cloying in lesser talented hands DeJonge and Oxenbould are two of the most watchable things about the film. Oxenbould is a hoot as he gets increasingly more neurotic and DeJonge adds emotional heft to the more touching scenes of the movie which mines themes of redemption forgiveness and the passage of time.USA TODAYCan M. Night Shyamalan make a film comeback?The twist when it comes plays out well but its not earth-shattering. The dialogue tends toward the cheesy at times  and the film isnt really all that scary. (Old-lady posterior and adult diapers account for some of the more truly frightening moments.) Shyamalan should get props for taking the found-footage aspect for a spin yet it doesnt add significantly to the proceedings.That said its not killer plants attacking mankind in The Happening and thats a good thing. After taking Hollywood by storm in the 90s and then weathering the fallout of plenty of bad movies afterward with The Visit Shyamalan finally shows signs where it counts -- on a cinema screen -- of his unbreakable commitment to his craft and the ability to still cook up some good stuff in his house.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A trip to Nana and Pop Pops gets spooky when two kids witness their grandmother acting strangely.

Photo Handout MOVIE REVIEW The Visit Running time 94 minutes. Rated PG-13 (language disturbing imagery nudity). Now playing. Director M. Night Shyamalan goes old-school in this silly but effective horror flick the basic (and somewhat mean-spirited) premise of which is ""elderly people are weird."" Siblings Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are sent to spend a week with their heretofore-unknown grandparents who are estranged from their mother (Kathryn Hahn) but eager to meet her offspring. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) initially present as a doting cliche and the kids good-naturedly roll their eyes at the slow pace of farm life and their mandated 930 bedtime. Somewhat more unsettling is what they see when they crack open their door after lights out Nana scratching at the wall stark naked or pacing the halls while vomiting. ""Shes an old lady"" Pop Pop explains when they interrogate him about their grandmas bizarre nocturnal activities. ""She gets sick sometimes."" He meanwhile has his own secrets one of which Tyler finds hidden in the shed. (Dude never go in the shed) Mom who wont tell her kids what caused the estrangement from her parents chats with the kids via Skype and seems unfazed by their insistence that something isnt quite right. Conveniently Becca is an aspiring filmmaker. Her handheld footage (thankfully not all of the shaky-cam variety) is one of the directors many nods to genre classics from ""The Blair Witch Project"" to ""The Exorcist"" to ""Paranormal Activity."" Less generously one could accuse Shyamalan of being shamelessly derivative -- but hey hes cribbing from reliably spooky tactics (as opposed to hitting us with overblown CGI as hes been known to do). As screenwriter hes also crafted a pretty decent fairy tale right up to having Nana invite her granddaughter to get ALL the way in the oven to clean it. Dunagan and McRobbie have a blast in their respective roles alternating between everyday grandparent oddities and behavior that wouldnt be out of place at the Overlook Hotel. And overall the young duo makes an affable pair of narrators. Of course there will be a twist because thats Shyamalans thing. Like the film itself its simple but well-executed enough. Maybe youll spot it a mile away; I didnt (and didnt try to as I think that tends to spoil the fun). The bigger surprise here may be that after the disaster that was the 2013 Will and Jaden Smith movie ""After Earth"" the director may be back in fighting shape.

Night Shyamalan Written by M. Night Shyamalan Duration 94 minutes Related Stories After Earth Movie 43 sweep Razzies; Adam Sandler shut out Airbender DVD highlights errors M. Night Shyamalans five biggest shockers Airbender a tedious tale The biggest unexpected twist in a new M. Night Shyamalan movie is walking out of the theatre and saying ""You know what? That didnt entirely suck."" Shyamalan who blew our minds with 1999s The Sixth Sense has managed to make every subsequent film just a little bit worse than the one before it. He hit rock bottom with 2010s The Last Airbender and 2013s After Earth and you couldnt blame the guy if he simply retired for good to lick his wounds and escape the neverending snark. But Shyamalan is nothing if not relentless and hes back once again with The Visit in theatres Friday. This time hes joined forces with Blumhouse Productions the low-budget high-concept horror maestros behind Paranormal Activity and Insidious. And while its not a perfect fit The Visit lands smack dab in the middle of the Shyamalan quality spectrum - not as good as Unbreakable or Signs but not as bad as The Happening or Lady in the Water. In The Visit a pair of precocious but likable siblings - studious film nerd Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her goofball younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) - are sent by their single mom (Kathryn Hahn) to visit their grandparents for a week. Mom is estranged from her parents because of some dark incident in the past but she likes the idea of her kids meeting their Nana and Pop Pop for the very first time. Becca decides to make a documentary of the trip and the entire film is shot from the perspective of her and Tylers video cameras. All seems fine at first but Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) exhibit increasingly bizarre behaviour ranging from Pop Pop hoarding used adult diapers to Nana roaming around the house at night crawling on all fours and clawing at the walls. Is it simple dementia? Or something much more sinister? I figured out the twist in The Visit at exactly 22 minutes in but thats the problem with Shyamalan movies because hes so famous - or infamous - for his twists its difficult to watch his films without analyzing every scene and attempting to reverse engineer the third act surprise. Another dubious Shyamalan trademark rears its head when the kids film each other digging into the pain of being abandoned by their father where Tyler recounts how he froze during a crucial play in a football game and Becca admits she cant look in a mirror. Theyre heartfelt scenes but set up moments in the films climax in a way thats silly and unnecessary. Not as bad as the ""swing away"" nonsense that almost ruined Signs though. Fortunately The Visit has a lot of (intentional) laughs between the creepy bits and jump scares and never takes itself too seriously. Once the surprise is revealed spooky tension is jettisoned in favour of full-on horror camp although the ending manages to avoid the formulaic ""ONE LAST SCARE"" tactic for something more gentle and relatable. The Visit certainly wont give The Sixth Sense a run for its money but Shyamalan deserves some credit for not giving up. Next time he shows up at the door we might just let him in.

Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense) teams up with low-budget horror producer Jason Blum (Paranormal Activity) for a found-footage scare comedy and the results are good fun. A teenage documentary maker and her younger brother travel to the countryside for a weeklong visit with their maternal grandparents whom theyve never met. The old folks seem friendly but theyre clearly harboring dark secrets; for reasons not explained they prohibit the kids from leaving their bedroom after 930 PM and Nana has a strange preoccupation with watching her granddaughter clean the oven. Shyamalans nuanced characterization of the children feels authentic and provides an interesting contrast with his broadly comic treatment of the grandparents. His manipulation of tone is impressive--he gets you to laugh at the grandparents strange behavior only to shift gears into horror when you least expect it.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan September 10 2015 Nana and Pop Pop (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) welcome the grandchildren theyve never met into their home. (Universal Pictures) Measured against the low expectations that the name M. Night Shyamalan has come to engender in the hearts and minds of his former fans ""The Visit"" is a triumphant return to form for the filmmaker of ""The Sixth Sense"" whose once-promising career has steadily declined for at least the past decade. The new film is an effective if flawed psychological thriller a modest campfire story with a solid genuinely startling twist that is likely to restore the faith of some of his critics. Two teenagers have come to rural Pennsylvania to visit their mothers parents -- in fact to meet them for the first time. No sooner have 13-year-old Tyler and his older sister Becca (Ed Oxenbould and Olivia DeJonge) arrived in the home of Nana and Pop Pop (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) than the old folks start acting funny. Nana wanders around the spooky old farmhouse after dark clawing at doors; Pop Pop is incontinent and forgetful. To a child thats understandably disturbing. To anyone who knows anything about age-related dementia and ""sundowning"" -- the confusion sometimes experienced by seniors at night -- its not that big a deal. But Shyamalans script gradually cranks things up. By the end of Tyler and Beccas week in the country their grandparents really seem to have lost their marbles setting the story up for the doozy of a corkscrew turn thats coming. If it takes Shyamalan a while to get to that juncture -- and it does; there are moments when ""The Visit"" is almost painfully dull -- the payoff is worth the wait. Siblings Tyler and Becca (Ed Oxenbould and Olivia DeJonge) voice concerns about their grandparentss behavior to their mother (Kathryn Hahn). (Universal Pictures) Shyamalan has always had a flair for visual storytelling even when his plots have been over-the top as in ""Lady in the Water"" or lacking as in ""The Happening."" Here however he throws flashy camerawork out the window resorting to the lazy cinematographers trick of found footage. (The conceit of ""The Visit"" is that Becca an aspiring filmmaker is shooting a documentary about her mothers childhood home with the assistance of her younger brother. Mom played by Kathryn Hahn is seen mainly via videoconference on Beccas laptop. ""No one gives a crap about cinematic standards"" cracks Tyler in one of many inside-joke lines exchanged between the adolescent filmmakers in this celebration of the shaky camera.) In addition to its slowness and general ugly visuals ""The Visit"" has other problems. For a long time its only sort of scary sort of funny and sort of poignant. A back story about the childrens estranged father -- whose marriage to their mother caused a rift in her relationship with her parents -- feels like a distraction for much of the film. In the end however Shyamalan makes that broken family dynamic work for the story enriching and deepening a tale that could easily have been just another cheesy horror story. The cast of mostly unfamiliar actors also serves ""The Visit"" well. Shyamalan has a gift for eliciting strong performances even when his material is lacking. When one of his spooky bedtime stories is at full boil -- as it is in ""The Visits"" final dementedly fun third act -- theres just no stopping him. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains frightening images brief nudity and coarse language. 94 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Ed Oxenbould (left) Olivia DeJonge and Kathryn Hahn in M. Night Shyamalans ""The Visit."" Photo Associated Press Shyamalan makes a sort of comeback with The Visit 1 / 2 Back to Gallery A ""return to form"" from M. Night Shyamalan is worthy of skepticism like a new Guns N Roses album or a mayoral promise to fix your citys public transit. After his career broke open with two outstanding horror/superhero films Shyamalan directed two flawed but interesting follow-ups before descending into a series of misfires across several genres. Somewhere between ""Lady in the Water"" and ""After Earth"" most of us forgot what we liked about this guy. ""The Visit"" is in that ""flawed-but-interesting"" category a much more enjoyable film to watch in real time than to think about on the way home. Shyamalan doesnt reach ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable"" heights but his scriptwriting is livelier than weve seen in years and theres a sense of humor that was missing in even his best work. At times he seems to be poking good-natured fun at his own reputation. That may be his best move right now. Audiences have come to expect that there will be at least one twist in his movies so the element of surprise is ruined. Shyamalan responds with a flurry of misdirection. Everyone knows hes a magician now so distraction is a necessary part of the trick. The plot of ""The Visit"" has a heavy Little Red Riding Hood feel with Tyler and Rebecca (Ed Oxenbould and Olivia DeJonge) going to the house of grandparents theyve never met because their mother ran away as a teen. ""Nana and Pop Pop"" seem charming at first but the warning not to leave their room after 930 p.m. proves to be good advice. Something strange possibly supernatural is going on in the basement. And these precocious kids with their digital cameras cant keep their curiosity in check. Those cameras -- and Shyamalans found footage approach -- are the movies first misstep. Although it helps with the introductions and generates a few good scares the director films himself into a corner in the later scenes. If were going to be even halfway honest with ourselves as audience members both of these kids would have dropped their cameras and run for the hills during the second act or used them as weapons in the third. Much like Shyamalans flawed/interesting films ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" the filmmaker promises more than he can deliver. When the Big Bad reveals itself its maybe one-third as scary as the possibilities that were swirling through your head. The ending isnt as ridiculous as the you-can-kill-the-aliens-with-a-glass-of-water coda in ""Signs"" but its definitely a letdown. In the moment however the movie is almost always enjoyable. The writer-director shows his talent working with young actors ramping up the precociousness of the two leads then using their clever expressiveness for humorous effect when the overnighter with Grandma and Grandpa goes haywire. There appear to be few special effects in the film and the biggest star is arguably that guy who always plays a judge on ""Law amp; Order"" (Peter McRobbie sufficiently creepy). But with Shyamalans confident hand ""The Visit"" never feels low budget. It would be lazy to spoil the turns in the second and third acts so well compliment the little details instead. The way Nana (Deanna Dunagan) keeps making bigger and bigger breakfasts every morning. The running joke about all the strangers in Rebeccas film wanting to show off their amateur acting skills. The production design work in Pop Pops woodshed ... And then M. Night sufficiently Shyamalans the ending -- his name is a verb at this point right? -- perhaps telegraphing the primary twist a little too much but giving the audience a fun final 10 minutes. Also credit the man for wedging a tense game of Yahtzee in the climax. Thats not the move of a director who is stuck in a rut. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Night Shyamalan revisits horror of his past in creepy The Visit REVIEW By remaining a smartly staged thriller rather than a formula shocker ""The Visit"" does quite well with precisely what it set out to do play on all our fears like a Steinway grand piano.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune September 11 2015 -- 1004am Universal Pictures Ed Oxenbould Olivia DeJonge and Kathryn Hahn in ""The Visit."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Fright films are so often made in spendthrift form crammed with effects and stunts sounds and surprises aimed at making us jump again and again. The best path to severe anxiety is much simpler and free. Just introduce tension and wait until the unseen and the unknown raise us to the heart attack level of angst. This is just what ""The Visit"" does and why its a nifty cascade of suspense scares and surprises. By remaining a smartly staged thriller rather than a formula shocker it does quite well with precisely what it set out to do play on all our fears like a Steinway grand piano. The setup is familiar enough to put a nice rug under our feet. This is presented as yet another found footage film though its far too well photographed and lightened with dashes of ironic humor. At the center are two siblings recording a weeks winter holiday at their long-estranged grandparents farmhouse. The kids are the movies director in chief 15-year-old Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) a bright know-it-all Philadelphia city girl and her 13-year-old brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) a wiseguy she has appointed as her camera assistant. We open with their cameras rolling. The curtain-raiser for Rebeccas documentary is her interview with their single mother (Kathryn Hahn) who refuses to detail why she hasnt been on speaking terms with Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) for years. While Mom sets off for a vacation with her new boyfriend the duo head off by train to the relatives small-town home. What ideal folks their newfound elders are. The kids who mock each others foibles with secret on-camera monologues are both at a sensitive stage of life. They miss their runaway father and need more attention than Mom can offer. Pop Pop a sort of white-haired Paul Bunyan who loves chopping firewood with his big ax and Nana a whiz of a baker seem like just what they need. The grandparents greet the pair with great affection. They let the kids play hide and seek in the barns crawl space. They are good sports about being filmed. And when that footage captures them exhibiting eccentric behavior after dark Pop Pop gently apologizes ""Were old people."" Best the kids should go to sleep right at 930 p.m. he says. And always always stay out of the basement. As the story moves on the tales that Nana and Pop Pop tell their little darlings reveal some nutty inner voices. Inquiring neighbors begin to drop by when the couple are absent asking if things are OK. Rebecca and Tyler begin to suspect that their hosts are weird-old like the witch who wanted to put Hansel and Gretel in her oven. Or as Tyler puts it like ""Halloween"" mental hospital runaway Michael Myers. the visit 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for disturbing thematic material including terror violence and some nudity and for brief language. Since almost the entire film happens without mood-setting music or gimmicky cinematography viewers are as mystified as the children. As the activities we see evolve from kooky to eerie to freaky were torn between feeling amused or scared stiff. We build to a literally dirty gag that is at once the most repulsive and sidesplitting zinger in a month of Sundays. ""The Visit"" is a standout in the increasingly crowded field of fright movies. DeJonge and Oxenbould are outstandingly good as the show-off kids deliberately overacting for their own home movie. Shes touching as the sensitive leader of the pair; his hambone emoting steals scene after scene. The senior actors are wonderfully hard to read making us shiver and sympathize by turns. This keen creep show was written directed and produced by M. Night Shyamalan an up-and-down filmmaker who likes to finish his movies with unexpected O. Henry surprises. The shock here is that after a decade away from praiseworthy work hes back in crackerjack form. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""No one cares about cinematic standards."" M. Night Shyamalan bless his heart is too artful to commit to the shaky home video look and dead-air pacing of found-footage and instead comes up with an ingenious workaround framing The Visit from the perspective of a 15-year-old budding filmmaker as she tries to make a documentary about her creepy grandparents. Self-reflexive and dosed with macabre humor this offbeat exercise in just-around-the-corner horror grounds the largely exhausted found-footage approach in classical storytelling and visual values resulting in a refreshing (and memorably strange) genre piece premised almost entirely on a childs willingness to accept grown-up weirdness as long as it ensures stability.Instead of cheating its way out of the motivation problem that plagues most found-footage flicks--""Why are they still filming?""--The Visit puts it front and center tweaking its own visual style--too spotless to pass for real--in the process. Here Becca (Olivia DeJonge) teenage and prone to awkward five-dollar word usage brings along her cameras for a trip out to small-town Pennsylvania where she and little brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) will be spending the week with their long-estranged grandparents (Peter McRobbie Deanna Dungan). Beccas goal is simple enough She wants to get her grandparents to talk about and forgive her mom--who hasnt seen her folks since leaving home at 19--on camera in the hope of mending a family broken by decades of resentment and more recently a painful divorce.This is immediately complicated by said grandparents bizarre behavior which ranges from paranoia and forgetfulness to a tendency to crawl around the house naked after dark scratching at the walls. Theres a basement that cant be opened and a strict 930 p.m. curfew and whenever Becca tries to get grandma and grandpa to open up they respond with eerily matter-of-fact stories about invisible monsters and UFOs. Fairy tale imagery abounds a secluded well an ax a house in the woods Beccas way of comparing her project to ""an elixir"" endless plates of sweets and an oven thats just the perfect size for a girl of 15. Shyamalan plays many of the movies most unsettling moments for laughs just as he does Beccas adolescent artistic ambitions--complete with Barbara Walters-esque interview questions and self-conscious staging--and her awkward attempts at ingratiating herself and Tyler with two people who are effectively strangers. Becca insists on calling the two Nana and Pop Pop and some of the movies best gags come from the characters attempts at playing the part of a family leading to a climax set around a demented nightmarish game of Yahtzee. (Theres probably a thesis to be written about the way Shyamalan zeroes in on the performative side of family here with an emphasis on the theatrically artificial lighting of the grandparents house.) And though it never matches the elegance and atmosphere of Shyamalans best work--partly because the writer-director intentionally deflates the tension with jokes and kid-friendly wisecracks until the third act--the movies free-for-all approach to domestic horror still produces plenty of indelible images framed so that the viewer knows exactly what theyve seen but still cant make sense of whats going on. Following a creative low period that found the director trying his hand at effects-driven fantasy and sci-fi it cant help but come across as a comeback.For thoughts on and a place to discuss the plot details not talked about in this review visit The Visits spoiler space.

USA TODAYGrandma may offer cookies during the day but things get weird at night in M. Night Shyamalans ""The Visit.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 4.5 stars""The Visit"" is a return to form for the much-maligned director M. Night Shyamalan.Salvation has come for M. Night Shyamalan in the form of ""The Visit.""  A scary fun-house ride that expertly blends jittery tension and laugh-out-loud humor it will make you forgive the filmmaker for such major time-wasters as ""Lady in the Water"" ""After Earth"" and ""The Happening.""Well maybe not ""The Happening."" Still it is a major move toward redemption.The movies premise is almost deceptively simple. A single mother (Kathryn Hahn) hasnt spoken to her parents in 15 years following a painful incident that she refuses to discuss with her two children. Now her parents have reached out via e-mail and asked to meet their grandchildren. Because Mom also wants to enjoy a cruise with a new boyfriend it seems like a good idea to send the kids off on their own to the small snowy Pennsylvania town where she grew up so they can make family connections.Becca (Olivia DeJonge) is an aspiring filmmaker who plans to make a documentary out of the visit. Little brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) helps out filming everything around him. Both are scarred from their parents breakup Becca lacks self-esteem and Tyler has a phobia about germs. The setup really works mainly because the young stars give such warm natural performances. They never ham it up for the camera.Once the two get to their grandparents farm they enjoy their new relations. Sure Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) insists they dont come out of their bedroom after 930 p.m. and Nana (Deanna Dunagan) gets violently ill once the sun goes down but its nothing too off-putting.Those early moments eventually turn out to be pretty low on the weirdness scale. Pop Pop seems awfully fond of the shotgun he keeps in the shed. He also thinks hes constantly running late for a costume party. Nana wanders around after dark scratching at the walls and exposing herself.  Becca tries to explain things away blaming old-age quirks and illness but things grow increasingly darker.You cant say much more than that without exposing too much of the clever framework that Shyamalan has created.  Needless to say pretty soon things are clattering in the night suspicions are raised and the suspense keeps ratcheting up. Oh and playing hide-and-seek in the houses crawlspace is a definite no-no.AZCENTRALThe Visit (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe children are a big reason the movie works as well as it does. They bicker but also genuinely care about each other.  A sequence  in which Becca tries to calm Tyler down after he panics about his dirty hands is handled with a graceful sensitivity. Its also indicative of the movies perfectly satisfying mix of poignant family drama horror weirdness and off-kilter humor.The two young actors ably deliver the latter part of the equation. Beccas haughty auteur theories almost seem like an inside joke aimed at Shyamalan.  Tyler is a budding rapper who uses the names of female pop stars instead of curse words. Therefore when something alarms him he will cry out ""Shakira"" It sounds awkward but works really well on film (again kudos to Oxenbould who also headlined ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"").One thing that doesnt work the movies big reveal. ""The Visit"" plays its hand too early (I guessed the twist during the first 45 minutes) but it doesnt damage the film. Luckily the movie isnt simply built on a gimmicky twist (a la the filmmakers ""The Village"") but rather on characters we care about getting trapped in a terrifying situation.Shyamalan makes wonderful use of the found-footage format particularly in an epilogue that is a bit syrupy but makes perfect sense in its movie-within-a-movie way. Frightening touching and pure fun ""The Visit"" is grandly entertaining on many different levels. In other words Shyamalan is working at the top of his game.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849. Twitter.com/randy_cordova.The Visit 4.5 starsDirector M.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 717am on Thursday Sep. 10 2015 Thursday Sep. 10 2015 Thursday Sep. 10 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Remember what the world was like when anyone last cared about an M. Night Shyamalan movie? George W. Bush was in the White House and you couldnt even tweet about how cool you thought Signs was because Twitter didnt exist yet. The early 2000s seem like several lifetimes ago especially for the director who soared early in his career with The Sixth Sense Unbreakable and yes Signs and then spiraled into creative freefall through the likes of The Last Airbender and After Earth.But with the clever cheeky and only slightly scary horror film The Visit Shyamalan is partying like its 2000 all over again.Fifteen-year-old budding documentary filmmaker Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her 13-year-old wanna-be rapper brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are going to visit their grandparents whom theyve never seen. Mom (Kathryn Hahn) cut ties with her parents years ago when she ran off with her childrens father -- who has since left her for another woman.Grandfather aka Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) and Nana (Deanna Dunagan) have tracked their daughter down online and invited the children to stay for a week at their isolated farm in the Pennsylvania countryside where theres no cellphone service. That means Mom can take a break from parenting to spend some quality time with her boyfriend on a cruise. And if Mom and the kids need to talk theres always Skype.Sounds like a good plan except for that ""isolated farm"" part.Faster than you can say ""I see old people"" Pop Pop and Nana turn out to be as creepy as midnight in a graveyard. But its good Becca has brought a couple of cameras and her laptop along to document all the strange things that go bump in the long night.Since much of the film is from the viewpoint of her cameras The Visit fits into the tiresome found-footage trend but Shyamalan who also wrote the script unexpectedly injects it all with such a wily sense of humor that it works.Much of the success of The Visit goes to the cast specifically to the two young Australians DeJonge and especially Oxenbould ( Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day). They display a very real sense of sibling chemistry and an almost improvisational sense of comic timing that make their interactions a joy to watch even if whats going on around them is typical haunted-house stuff.While the film never devolves into some kind of Wayans Brothers-like parody seeing Tyler channel his inner Drake is worth the price of admission alone (be sure to stay for the beginning of the end-credits).Likewise McRobbie ( Boardwalk Empire) and Dunagan ( Just Like a Woman) play the grandparents with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek tone without spilling over into overkill. Its a tightrope everyone manages to walk with skill.Shyamalan is known for his patented twist endings but thankfully he seems less concerned about it this time instead focusing on telling a good fun story in place of just conjuring a memorable gimmick. The Visit is lightweight and doesnt have the emotional resonance of The Sixth Sense but its a welcome return to form for a director who seemed doomed to a future of remembering better days.With this and Wayward Pines the well-received miniseries he recently produced Shyamalan definitely has his groove back. Except this time everyone can tweet about it. Cary Darling 817-390-7571 carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Night Shyamalan following the disastrous hat-trick of The Happening The Last Airbender and After Earth a run of stinkers that makes Ed Wood look like Scorsese. And on the surface at least The Visit feels like a welcome return to the The Sixth Sense and the writer-directors early successes with its rural Pennsylvania setting hairpin plot and forgettable title. Its constructed as a homemade documentary by 15-year-old movie geek Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her wanna-be-rap-star little brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) whose trip to visit their estranged grandparents (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) gradually flips from a fun family getaway to a terrifying endurance test when it turns out the old folks have some unsavory nocturnal habits. Shyamalan proves he hasnt lost his knack for a short sharp shock--theres a hide-and-seek scene thatll leave you whimpering--and his inevitable twist is a doozy. But there are two major problems here and theyre both blond blue-eyed and unbearable if Beccas habit of spouting great chunks of moviemaking lore isnt irksome enough Tylers penchant for breaking into squeaky improvised rhyme might actually induce panic attacks. The result is a bizarre conflicted mess horrifying when its trying to be funny oddly appealing when it turns the screws. Still if youve ever wanted to hear a lisping 12-year-old rap about how traumatic it is to have shit rubbed in your face by an elderly relative step right up.

"Review With The Visit M. Night Shyamalan is back in the game - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview With The Visit M. Night Shyamalan is back in the gameBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 09/09/2015 113700 AM PDTUpdated 09/09/2015 045622 PM PDTClick photo to enlarge Olivia DeJonge plays the role of Becca in ""The Visit."" (Photo courtesy Universal Pictures/TNS) <<123>>Mention the name M. Night Shyamalan and chances are youre in for a vitriolic rant about how the once-vaunted ""The Sixth Sense"" filmmaker now produces awful movies.Much of that outrage is justified given duds such as ""The Happening"" ""The Village"" ""The Last Airbender"" and most certainly ""After Earth.""But before we go too far ganging up on Shyamalan lets consider his most recent efforts which offer an inkling he might be getting his A-game back given his well-received summer TV series ""Wayward Pines"" and the positive advance word surrounding his funny and scary (in that order) ""The Visit."" (L-R) Olivia DeJonge as Becca and Deanna Dunagan as Nana in The Visit. (Universal Studios) ( Universal Studios ) Turns out that Shyamalan is on the right path with ""The Visit"" a trippy mockumentary genre mashup that revisits such haunts as ""Hansel and Gretel"" ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise.The disappointing news is that a few of Shyamalans annoying habits buzz around like gnats at a picnic. The overstated intentions and heavy-handed messaging persist and while they dont swarm with the same force as in ""After Earth"" and ""The Happening"" theyre still pesky and hamper what could have been a better film.Advertisement ""The Visit"" works best when it doesnt overextend itself. Shyamalans trickster screenplay finds two teen siblings Becca and Tyler traveling by Amtrak to a small Pennsylvania farm for their first-time visit with grandparents. Their mom (Kathryn Hahn adding brightness to any production) had a terrible cant-speak-about-it-because-its-so-painful falling out with her parents 15 years ago but she agrees to allow her kids to stay while shes on a cruise with her boyfriend. (L-R) Ed Oxenbould as Tyler Deanna Dunagan as Nana and Peter McRobbie as Pop Pop in The Visit. (Universal Studios) ( Universal Studios ) For budding documentary filmmaker Becca this is an opportunity to make a video for mom by interviewing her grandparents and revisiting the hometown. Beccas goal is to mend family ties and figure out what broke them apart.Shyamalan plays it loose from the start making us laugh at the antics of these two appealing kids played with charm by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould and does that by interjecting sly references to filmmaking and having Tyler rap on the train. That rambling breezy style goes overboard at points but it does work on two levels making the audience relax and getting them emotionally invested. Sensing the inevitable bad turn lurking right around the corner were gleeful in our anticipation.When Becca and Tyler first meet Pop Pop (a creepy Peter McRobbie) and Nana (Tony winner Deanna Dunagan whos a scream here) its all Hallmark card perfection with the quaint couple looking like they stepped straight out of a Norman Rockwell illustration. Nana even brings baked goods to the station with her. But somethings not right with either of these crackpots. The woodshed out back contains gross-out evidence of something most foul and Nanas nighttime vomiting is rather worrisome. So is her lightning-fast ability to play hide and seek and her diabolical encouragement for Becca to clean the oven by going way way way back into it. These make ""The Visit"" frightfully fun with Shyamalan relentless toying with us and cramming in horror genre references. He even delivers a worthy twist near the finale. So its a pity the film gets so wrapped up in wanting to extol The Message. While its a noble and life-affirming concept he wants to impart its another example of a tonal shift -- one of many -- that comes out clunky.It also cements what ""The Visit"" and Shyamalan need an ace story editor someone who could tell the filmmaker to step away at the right time and give the message-hammering a rest. the visit   1/2Rating PG-13 (for disturbing thematic material including terror violence and some nudity and for brief language)Cast Olivia DeJonge Ed Oxenbould Deanna Dunagan Peter McRobbie Kathryn HahnDirector and writer M.

The Visit Is the Third First-Rate M. Night Shyamalan Film Wednesday September 9 2015 at 1139 a.m. By Alan Scherstuhl EXPAND A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Who saw this coming? The Visit M. Night Shyamalans witty crowd-jolting spook-house of an eleventh feature is its writer-directors best movie since the tail-end of the last Clinton era. And its the best studio horror flick in recent years combining the but-whats-in-those-shadows? immersion of The Conjuring James Wans basement-wandering simulator with the crack scripting and meta-cinematic surprises of Shyamalans best early films. Plus jokes a rapping white pre-teen boy and a gross-out gag so potent that the crowd I saw this with straight-up screamed. One woman yelled that just watching it she needed to wash her face.The feeling throughout is not that of a once-promising talent attempting a comeback. Its that of a champ at play. Most startling of all Hes beating younger players at their own game. The Visit is yet another cheap-o found-footage scare picture but one crafted with a rigor and intelligence too rarely applied to the genre. Shyamalan isnt slumming. He sources in character the origin of each shot but hes not surrendering the frame to amateurs. Even when the kids purporting to carry the camera flop onto a bed the composition remains clear and inventive even clever with any individual setup revealing new dimensions the longer we look. At the films best Shyamalan and director of photography Maryse Alberti rig together several of those setups without a cut most memorably in a mid-movie lulu that serves as a mini-lesson in horror history A familiar Paranormal Activity-style fixed-position surveillance shot becomes as we cower a kinetic villains-eye p.o.v. shot right out of last generations Halloween complete with a wicked blade from the kitchen.Film DetailsCritics Pick The Visit RatingPG-13 GenreHorror Running Time94 min. More Info Trailer Shyamalan even offers a satisfying answer to the question that can undo the logic of almost every found-footage film If this footage is meant to be our only surviving document of fantastic goings-on why did whoever edited it together bother to include all that un-fantastic character business in the first reels? For once we actually know who the in-story editor is and for once it makes sense that the thriller the heroes accidentally shot would be edited into a feature-length shocker. EXPAND The premise is simple yet edged with fable and nightmare. Two kids get packed off by their overworked single mom to spend a week with the grandparents theyve never met. Nana and Pop-Pop seem eccentric at first and they warn the children that bedtime on the rural Pennsylvania farm is 930 p.m. The kids -- brainy filmmaker-in-training Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and self-consciously un-brainy prepubescent rapper boy Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) -- fail to keep to their bedroom and naturally stumble through dark hallways into jump-scare trouble. Something is off with the grandparents especially at night when the house rocks with strange knockings. Shyamalan is quick to get to what audiences consider the good stuff an ill-advised game of hide-and-seek underneath a low-to-the-ground porch; a trip into the shed when Pop-Pops not looking. Even in the sunny kitchen Nana proves creepy urging her granddaughter to help clean out the oven by climbing all the way inside. These scenes are scary-fun rather than scary-sadistic the kind where you laugh a little in anticipation of what the movie will spring next.What it springs I wont spoil except to say that its the most Ive laughed at a Shyamalan film since The Happening -- but this time that laughter was on his terms. For the first time in years Shyamalan proves a shrewd and commanding filmmaker goosing the audience to feel just what he wants us to. (Rebecca a quick study of movie technique even announces aloud that she would like to do what the director prides himself on stirring emotion from an audience without making us aware of the effort to do so.) Again Shyamalan proves himself adept with child actors guiding his leads to winning likable transparent performances -- these kids never seem to strain for effect. Oxenbould clowns memorably lampooning the scare scenes just moments after weve recovered and even making his rap shtick funny. DeJonge shoulders scenes freighted with smarty-pants cuteness A book-learned budding director she has to chatter about mise-en-scene in a film that often exemplifies the concept. And the grandparents played by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie smartly modulate from scene to scene coming off as apple-pie sweet then piercingly senile then imposingly mad. These actors are given the highest grade of bunk to play and they play it -- and really thats the triumph of this strange funny nasty little thriller. Rather than try to live up to the expectations of those existential beauties The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable Shyamalan is playing with form with genre with perspective with us. The twist this time is that hes having a ball -- and you probably will too. EXPAND The Visit Written and directed by M.

If you could view it in the context of no context ""The Visit"" might just be another slightly second-hand B-movie horror film one with its fair share of jump scares and a select precious few moments when you feel something like a true shiver of fright or fear run through you unbidden. If ""The Visit"" -- with its star-free cast ""found footage"" presentation through the cameras POV and sound effects that are 10000 times more creepy than anything CGI could enable you to see -- were the debut by a young writer-director working with a limited budget I could see myself being intrigued by its gusto and interested in seeing what the filmmaker did next. Also Read Mark Duplass Gets Scary in New Creep Trailer (Video) But context does matter and the fact that ""The Visit"" is not some young talents first film but rather M. Night Shyamalans 11th coming on the heels of both ""After Earth"" and ""The Last Airbender"" films whose gigantic budgets were linked as if through voodoo to the minuscule size of their audience. Working with producing wunderkind Jason Blum -- whose philosophy of fast-and-cheap makes for profitable horror films if not always good ones -- Shyamalan keeps ""The Visit"" a lowdown and simple affair but you also cant help but feel a little annoyed by it; its so low-profile its almost invisible so fast-and-dirty it winds up a smeary blur. Teens Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) love their mom (Kathryn Hahn); in the name of giving her some alone time on vacation with her new beau they agree to go on a train trip to stay with moms long-estranged mom and dad whom she hasnt seen in years but recently reconnected with. Also Read Eli Roths Cannibal Movie The Green Inferno Lands Distribution From Blumhouse Label Despite the hinted-at unspoken fracture from long ago when mom left home Nana and Pop Pop (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) couldnt be happier to see Becca and Tyler. They want to help Becca with the documentary shes making (which is also the device capturing all the action); they want to hear all of Tylers rap songs which he performs under the name T-Diamond Stylus. Its a lot of fun until things start going bump in the night and Nana and Pop Pop are whats bumping and the thumping and other creepy things ... For all its flaws ""The Visit"" has great casting DeJonge and Oxenbould seem like real kids -- clever but not precocious unsure about the adult world but hardly naive. And the two actors playing Nana and Pop Pop Dunagan and McRobbie are true finds Shes a Tony winner with the face of a Midwestern matriarch and the ability to change gears on the fly; hes played a long line of criminals cops or criminal cops over the years and his grizzled authority seems both rock-solid and as insubstantial as a breeze when things start getting creepy. Also Read The Gallows Review Kathie Lee Giffords Daughter Cassidy Shines in Otherwise Dim Horror Flick The sound editing is also superb -- a lot of this film works best when you cant see it whether quiet creaks or loud thuds on the other sides of locked doors. And the location is so full of signifiers and stock settings -- the old shed the old well the old basement -- that Shyamalan has plenty of dark places and dusty sharp implements to imply trouble with. The films big reveal -- which is more prosaic than it is paranormal -- doesnt carry much besides a brief sting of concern and shock It doesnt open the movie up it shuts the film down and once we know whats going on all thats left is the shouting and the climax. Also Read The Visit Trailer Teases Worst Trip to Grandmas House Ever (Video) And that underwhelming climax of course is then undercut by two extraneous following scenes -- one a swamp of sentiment the other a burp of coarse comedy and both unrequired. Shyamalan has had some difficulties as a director of late and its understandable to hope that by placing him back in the realm of lower budgets and more manageable expectations he could impress us yet again; that turns out not to be the case this time. Short but too simple startling but never terrifying ""The Visit"" may make a little money but it does not mark a return to long-lost greatness for Shyamalan; instead its more of the same presented on a smaller cheaper canvas where you can see every flaw all the more clearly.

Night Shyamalan returns to thriller filmmaking in the style of low-budget impresario Jason Blum with mixed results. After delivering back-to-back creative and commercial duds in the sci-fi action genre M. Night Shyamalan retreats to familiar thriller territory with ""The Visit."" As far as happy homecomings go it beats the one awaiting his characters though not by much. The story of two teens spending a week with the creepy grandparents theyve never met unfolds in a mockumentary style thats new for the filmmaker and old hat for horror auds. Heavier on comic relief (most of it intentional) than genuine scares this low-budget oddity could score decent opening weekend B.O. and ultimately find a cult following thanks to its freakier twists and turns but hardly represents a return to form for its one-time Oscar-nominated auteur. In a way its a relief to see Shyamalan set aside the studio-system excesses of ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth"" and get down and dirty with a found-footage-style indie crafted in the spirit of producer Jason Blums single location chillers. (Blum actually joined the project after filming wrapped but it subscribes to his patented ""Paranormal Activity"" playbook to a T.) Except that the frustrating result winds up on the less haunting end of Shyamalans filmography far south of ""The Sixth Sense"" ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" and not even as unsettling as the most effective moments in the hokey ""The Happening."" Thats not to say ""The Visit"" is necessarily worse than some of those efforts just a different kind of animal. The simplicity of the premise initially works in the pics favor as 15-year-old aspiring documentarian Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her 13-year-old aspiring-rap-star sibling Tyler (Ed Oxenbould of ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"") say goodbye to their hard-working single mom (Kathryn Hahn better than the fleeting role deserves) who ships off on a weeklong cruise with her latest boyfriend. The kids travel by train to rural Pennsylvania to meet Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) the purportedly kindly parents Mom left behind when she took off with her high-school English teacher and caused a permanent rift in the family. Becca plans to turn the whole experience into an Oscar-caliber documentary (proving she sets her sights higher than Shyamalan these days) and also an opportunity to exorcise the personal demons both she and Tyler carry around in the wake of their parents separation. Unfortunately for the kids their grandparents appear to be possessed by demons of another kind -- although it takes an awfully long time for them to grow legitimately concerned about Nanas nasty habit of roaming the house at night vomiting on the floor and scratching at the walls in the nude and Pop Pops almost-as-bizarre behavior including stuffing a woodshed full of soiled adult diapers attacking a stranger on the street and regularly dressing in formal wear for a ""costume party"" that never materializes. Ominous warnings to not go into the basement (because of ""mold"" you see) and stay in their room after 930 (Nanas ""bedtime"") fly right over the heads of our otherwise pop-culture-savvy protagonists. Becca even stubbornly refuses to use her omnipresent camera for nighttime reconnaissance citing concerns over exploitation and ""cinematic standards"" -- one of the lamest excuses yet to justify dumb decisions in a horror narrative -- until the weeklong stay is almost up. Shyamalan has long been criticized for serving up borderline (or downright) silly premises with a straight face and overtly pretentious atmosphere but he basically abandons that approach here in favor of a looser more playful dynamic between his fresh-faced leads. At the same time theres a surreal campiness to the grandparents seemingly inexplicable behavior fully embraced by Tony winner Dunagan and Scottish character actor McRobbie that encourages laughter between ho-hum jump scares. Their antics only reach full-blown menacing in the perverse-by-PG-13-standards third act. (The obligatory reveal of whats really going on works OK as long as you dont question it any more than anyone onscreen ever does.) Even if theres less chance the audience will burst out in fits of inappropriate chuckles as was often the case in say ""The Happening"" or ""Lady in the Water"" Shyamalan still cant quite pull off the delicate tonal balance hes after. Once events ultimately do turn violent -- and Nana does more than just scamper around the floor or pop up directly in front of the camera -- the setpieces are never as scary or suspenseful as they should be. Even worse are the films attempts at character-driven drama including a couple of awkward soul-baring monologues from the otherwise poised young stars and a ludicrous epilogue that presumes auds will have somehow formed an emotional bond with characters who actually remain skin-deep throughout. One longs to see what a nervier filmmaker could have done with the concept (and a R rating). The technical package is deliberately less slick than the Shyamalan norm although scripting Becca as a budding filmmaker interested in mise en scene provides d.p. Maryse Alberti (whose numerous doc credits include multiple Alex Gibney features) an excuse to capture images with a bit more craft than the average found footage thriller. Shyamalan purposefully decided to forego an original score but the soundtrack is rarely silent between the chattering of the children a selection of source music and the eerie sound editing that emphasizes every creaking door and loud crash substituting for well-earned frights.

PAUL says February 14 2016 at 525 pm We rented this from redbox for 1.50. 6 of us watched it so thats. 25 cents each. WE GOT TOTALLY RIPPED OFF. What a waste of 2 hours of our lives. Im thinking of distroying the DVD instead of returning it to the redox in order to save the misery of waching this piece of crap film. Reply Chris says September 20 2015 at 701 am The Visit was corny and cheesy. It was Not scary. Just a few scary parts that often times ended in a disappointing conclusion. This couldnt come even near the greats such as The 6th sense the paranormals(except the horrible one they have on netflix now with the vulgar speaking spaniards)Guarantee you that if you go and spend money to see this you will leave very disappointed. Reply Dogwood says November 3 2015 at 1138 pm The Marked Ones was the best Paranormal Activity since the original and none of them are ""greats"" to begin with. Do you even understand horror? This movie wasnt very good but your comment was somehow worse. Reply Tom McDonald says September 19 2015 at 623 am Saw the film last night and I have to say that I will never again spend money on an M. Night film ever again. Hes only had a couple of good movies and the rest have sucked. This one is no exception. First of all lets address the found footage style of filming which is boring annoying and unimaginative and it is a film style that needs to be put to rest. The ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise has beaten it to death and those films are poorly written poorly acted and poorly directed and I assume anyone who thinks that they are scary would have a heart attack if someone popped up in front of them and said ""Boo"" really loudly. Getting back to Shyamalans crap fest which was so slow moving it takes way too long to get any momentum and by the time it does you dont really care. It relied on cliched brief jumps and was unintentionally ""funny"" and I still didnt get laughs from it. I found myself bored and actually hoping the kids would die early so I could go home. Recommendation? stay home and watch Scooby-Doo cartoons they are far scarier purposely funny and have likable characters. Reply Richard Hn says December 20 2015 at 603 pm Thanks. I just saw a DVD version of course long after the films appearance in theaters. The insult to the elderly with dementia is bad enough without the thoroughly contrived ""denouement"" (as the boy puts it). The mother gets a recording when calling the police then spends all that time driving there?? A kid always jumping around wisecracking and rapping stands there frozen? At the very least a simple 911 call (made by either or both mother and kids) would naturally end the danger rather quickly-unfortunately for Shyamalans farcical attempt at horror that last evening. Reply Fred says September 12 2015 at 849 pm Any movie review that refers to the audience as the auds should be wholeheartedly ignored. I thought that by reading Variety Id get a serious review...instead I got the UCLA interns version...likeOMGthismoviewascray Based on how badly this review has been written I hope this movie gets an Academy Award. Reply Bob grassing says September 12 2015 at 753 am Easily the worst film I have seen this year. The ""rapper"" was obnoxious. The use of the hand held camera by the aspiring film maker gave me a headache. The movie as a whole was boring. It would have worked better as a 30 minute episode of the old Twilight Zone series but cutting out the nonsense and focusing on the last third of the movie where the ""mystery "" unravels. Reply Elaine says September 12 2015 at 110 am Campy frightening funny fed up and ultimately a good movie. Just be prepared to schedule a few extra therapy sessions. Reply Tom McDonald says September 19 2015 at 625 am THANK YOUUUUU I totally agree. Sadly that is an hour and a half of my life I can never get back. And people wonder why I drink. Reply Harold smith says September 11 2015 at 1148 pm I saw the movie tonite. The onsite scenery and location adds a visually appealing element the film... Not some lame soundstage. I think it was well worth viewing. Reply Tim Johnson says September 11 2015 at 1021 pm Ok so you people are so jaded. This movie was a horror masterpiece. Analytical people are not able to set back and truly enjoy a movie because they lack the ability to truly surrender to the experience thats why I refuse to listen to critics opinions. Anyone that watched this movie and surrendered to the experience would only have good things to say about it. Everyone go and see this movie because it was amazing. Reply Tom McDonald says September 19 2015 at 628 am Your standards must be extremely low. There are few if any redeeming qualities to this film. Nor\t scary not funny not exciting there are so many things wrong with this film there isnt enough space in the comments section to point them out. Reply Kep says September 11 2015 at 909 pm Saw The Visit tonight (before reading any reviews). Now reading reviews I find the majority are very positive. Maybe they saw a different movie than we did. We found it lame. It never reached the ""Sixth Sense"" level I was hoping for. The expected Shyamalan twist wasnt nearly as impactful as it should have been. Perhaps it will grow on me as I think about it. I doubt it.... Reply Victoria says September 11 2015 at 355 am Previews look very good. I will see it. NOT pass. Reply stevenkovacs says September 9 2015 at 355 pm Pass Reply Ed Lover says September 9 2015 at 1229 pm The 90s called and they want your lame pronouncing of M. NIghts last name back. Reply HPR says September 9 2015 at 1129 am I think most directors and actors only get one or two great films in their lifetime. It just sucks when it happens your first or second time out. Reply Bill G. says September 9 2015 at 918 am While the physical fitness of the other-worldly may benefit from the young protags ""opportunity to exercise the[ir] personal demons"" I believe the writer was going for an earlier classic horror reference. Reply iceman says September 9 2015 at 811 pm The word is spelled exorcism.
