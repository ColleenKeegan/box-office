Comments Blindness I have to admire a mainstream movie thats so overwhelmingly bleak but thats the only real distinction of this dystopian sci-fi drama by Fernando Meirelles (City of God The Constant Gardener). An epidemic of blindness paralyzes the world and in one city armed guards herd the victims into a deserted mental hospital to fend for themselves. Conditions inside quickly devolve into Lord of the Flies-style savagery as a compassionate doctor (Mark Ruffalo) and his wife (Julianne Moore) whos concealing the fact that she can still see clash with a self-appointed dictator (Gael Garcia Bernal). Adapted from a novel by Nobel Prize winner Jose Saramago this ends on an uplifting and philosophical note equating moral blindness with the literal sort which youll probably appreciate if you havent already slit your wrists.

Of a mixed North and Latin American cast Julianne Moore (right) and Mark Ruffalo play the leads as an opthalmologist and his wife who are first on the scene when an unexplained pandemic of blindness breaks out in an unnamed (but New York-evocative) metropolis. Meirelles initially mounts the film as a generic apocalyptic thriller - distant shots of traffic chaos as another victim is blinded -  before modulating into briefly disease-of-the-week investigation and more extensively pressure-cooker horror as the stricken are imprisoned together by jack-booted soldiers and start descending Lord of the Flies-style into internecine savagery among near Salo-levels of degradation. How thin is the veneer of civilisation? That is the question here with a supplementary query on the differing responses of men and women in the face of moral panic and necessary sacrifice. As most of us already know the answers to both all were left with is the spectacle - one of fumbling men and women reduced to foetal positions or shooting at each other in the dark. Sadly Blindness may realise its directors worst fear to produce not only an exploitation B-movie but one paradoxically spoiled by its own integrity and misplaced artistic mise-en-scene and intentions.

The sad thing is this could have been a good movie but It was so predictably cynical and pessimistic - hey and that is coming from someone who is constantly being accused of being a cynic  I have way more faith in human kind under extreme circumstances than this film does. Wow how utterly disappointed I am in this film. Its attempt to make up for all its lame and predictable bleakness at the end just makes it that much worse.

I am portuguese and ive tried to read saramagos books and his biggest mistake is that he assumes that 90% of the people in the world are evil and if they dont have police control theyll do the worst that they think of thats not the world that I live in Because if it was idd rather not live But also Fernando Meireles(also in city of god a great movie)produced scenes that are just sickening and perfectly avoidable to be honest I didnt liked it.

At first its occasionally unintentionally funny as the ludicrous plot unfolds a candidate for a Golden Turkey Award if ever there was one.

Based on the great 1995 novel by Nobel Prize winner Jose Saramago ""Blindness"" directed by Fernando Meirelles is one of the larger disappointments of the year. Set in a nameless English-speaking city where people are suddenly stricken with sightlessness its an allegory that never rises to the level of believability. After a powerful opening when we see the first victim suddenly go blind while driving in traffic the film devolves into a dystopian freak show and wastes many wonderful performers including Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore.

"Blindness A Deeply Compelling Story Lost in the Visuals washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Blindness A Deeply Compelling Story Lost in the Visuals Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Neely Tucker Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 3 2008 A man at a stoplight suddenly and without reason goes blind. He gets home with the help of a passerby and then his wife goes blind too. The nurse and doctor who treat him go blind hours later. So does the passerby. An epidemic and panic ensue. Several dozen of the infected are quarantined in a deserted mental hospital where they are guarded by a heavily armed militia that tosses in food and then runs for the barricades. Everyone inside is blind -- except the doctors wife who mysteriously remains immune. But the lockdown has come too late. The epidemic ravages the outside world. The people in the hospital are no longer being quarantined theyve been forgotten. No characters have a name nor does the city nor does the country. This is the premise of Nobel laureate JosA(c) Saramagos deeply affecting 1995 novel of the same name which he initially did not want made into a film but finally agreed to let the esteemed director Fernando Meirelles (""City of God"" ""The Constant Gardener"") take on. Meirelles brings a strong but reverent hand to the project. The cast likewise intuits that something special is going on here. Julianne Moore is the doctors wife Mark Ruffalo is the doctor Danny Glover is the old man with the eye patch and Gael GarcAa Bernal the most vicious man among the quarantined. And then . . . and then . . . ""Blindness"" turns out to be an elegant car that never quite cranks up. Its fascinating to look at but not nearly so interesting to sit through. Saramagos reluctance was not misplaced. The novels psychological and social insights its development of character and beauty of prose are lost when they are flattened out onscreen into violence and squalor. Were missing depth a weird little echo that keeps floating around the brain while the movie keeps checking off its list of important plot points from the book. Mood -- thats it too. Mood is hard to get in a visual story about mass blindness. Not that Meirelles doesnt come close at times. He elicits excellent performances throughout especially from Alice Braga as a blind prostitute. Cinematographer CA(c)sar Charlone gives us the ""white blindness"" of the plague. He paints the diminishing field of vision among the stricken as a pale watery fog like diluted white-out running across the eyeballs and its beautifully eerie. But then thats over and the underlying story starts wobbling. The allegory and the plot points of a thriller start getting mixed up. The energy sputters. Maybe this is Meirelles trying to slow himself down. ""City"" and ""Gardener"" thrived on physical movement and violent confrontation often taking place in urban slums. The psychological landscape of the gardener in Kenya and the deadly drug dealer in Brazil are understood through their interactions with the violent world around them. They act and therefore they are defined. Charlone who worked with him on both films conveys that energy with jittery nervy camerawork. ""Blindness"" is a richer denser more complex stew of humanity. The doctor is a good man walking through a marriage in which he and his wife seem to be passing each other on the way to somewhere else. When he wakes up the morning after treating the first victim hes blind. (When people lose their sight the movie tells us so via an audible ting like a fingernail tapping crystal.) His wife accompanies him to the quarantine hospital feigning blindness and they quickly set up a government of elected representatives and shared responsibilities. Its like the doctor humane sensible. But -- and this is where the engine starts missing -- Bernal shows up anoints himself ""King of Ward Three"" and brandishes a six-shot revolver. His aide-de-camp is a lifelong blind man with a walking stick. Ward Three wants to take over the place with a reign of violence and rape. Humanity devolves into degradation and exploitation. This sets up in both book and film a struggle between the decent and the depraved and it works much better in the novel. Meirelles hits the markers of collapsing morality but in such shorthand fashion that it feels like were reading Post-it notes stuck into the margins of Nietzsche. We watch smart people do things they know better than to do or be so cowed by another mans assertion of will that it doesnt ring true. Why do the decent men lapse into being cowards just because they lose their sight? Why do the women become braver? Why do the coarse become nihilistic? And why does everyone forget hygiene? Do the blind really lose the ability to use a toilet? Its never clear. The inner world of the quarantine will collapse and some of the victims will emerge into the larger city where dogs have begun to eat human corpses in the streets. When the doctors wife gets caught in a scrum with a pack (I cant think of another word) of blind people over a few cans of food in a grocery store it starts to look like too many after-the-end-of-it-all epics with a heroine facing the morning after the breeze stirring her hair a smile of inner strength playing out across her lips. It had me wondering how much bleaker it could get -- and then I remembered that the cinematic take on Cormac McCarthys ""The Road"" is due out later this year. Movies can work as fable and reality. The brilliant ""Pans Labyrinth"" reminded us of that. But literary novels can also stumble on the big screen as ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" made painfully clear. Meirelles a talented director has given us a thoughtful film based on a disturbing work of art. It achieves moments of beauty but also leaves us wanting to like it more than we actually do. Blindness (120 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence including sexual assaults language and sexuality/nudity. It is in English with a few subtitles.

ABOUT THE MOVIE Blindness  (out of four)Stars Julianne Moore Mark Ruffalo Danny GloverDirector Fernando MeirellesDistributor Miramax FilmsRating R for violence including sexual assault language and sexuality/nudityRunning time 2 hours 1 minuteExpands Friday By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Blindness is a brilliant idea that seems to lack the vision to be great. Based on Jose Saramagos award-winning allegorical novel it features strong performances from Julianne Moore Mark Ruffalo Danny Glover and Gael Garcia Bernal and begins with a powerful and disorienting sense of foreboding. VIDEO Open your eyes for Blindness But the middle lags and by the films conclusion youre left feeling curiously unsatisfied even beaten down. An inexplicable epidemic of blindness suddenly engulfs a nameless metropolis and builds to apocalyptic proportions. The first third of the film is truly disturbing as the sense of doom descends on civilization. Director Fernando Meirelles (The Constant Gardener) does a superb job via unsettling cinematography and stylish production design. The story focuses on a group quarantined in a deserted hospital where their primal instincts emerge. The film is an often thought-provoking metaphor. But as a thriller it becomes dreary. While Blindness builds to unnerving moments it becomes mired in heaviness taking on a strange lethargy before its jarring conclusion.

Julianne Moore right and Mark Ruffalo are shown in a scene from ""Blindness."" Photo Ken Woroner Miramax Films Film Clips 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Thriller. Starring Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore. Directed by Fernando Meirelles. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Blindness"" people suddenly and randomly go blind. No warning just boom - they cant see anything. Planes and buses crash traffic stalls and people are left in the street pleading ""Will somebody help me?"" And because the sighted assume this is a contagious epidemic the blind are soon quarantined put under armed guard and left to fend for themselves. The film based on the novel by the Portuguese Nobel laureate Jose Saramago is not easy to watch. At times its almost unbearably ugly - an almost unrelenting vision of squalor cruelty and human inadequacy. But by the time you walk out of the theater you know youve seen something. You know it because the street looks different and the people on it less trustworthy. Saramagos novel was written in the mid-1990s but nobody made it into a movie until now for reasons that are pretty obvious. More than at any time since at least the late 60s the Western world lives today with a pervasive terror of civic catastrophe the sense that either terrorism or some financial calamity (or a combination) might make all our institutions and codes of behavior collapse. ""Blindness"" speaks to that fear teases it and exploits it as well as granting a dark desire to get the apocalypse over with just to see whats on the other side. By no means is the movie a complete success. In places it drags. Too many scenes strike the same note and at times ""Blindness"" seems like a premise in search of a story and an allegory in search of a meaning. But in its methodical and uncompromising way it gets where it needs to go. It starts with one fellow who is driving in city traffic and is struck blind at a red light. He complains not of darkness but of white light. He goes to an ophthalmologist (Mark Ruffalo) and the next day the ophthalmologist is struck blind. So are thousands of other people and when that happens all hell breaks loose. A few years ago the authorities were the good guys in movies. Now the man with the badge and the gun the one who sternly and with mock patience says ""Come with me sir"" the one who doesnt want to hear anything doesnt want to know anything the one who just wants to obey orders - hes not the hero anymore. In ""Blindness"" thats the thug multiplied by thousands. But there are anti-authority thugs here too. Theyre among the quarantined and so life inside soon breaks down into a trash-strewn excrement-streaked institutionalized version of ""The Lord of the Flies."" Needless to say dont see this movie to feel good about the fundamental decency of human beings. ""Blindness"" is for more exotic tastes for people who like being forced to go places theyd never go to on their own. Director Fernando Meirelles (""The Constant Gardener"") gets under the viewers skin by making us always aware of our own seeing. He cuts to the bright-light perspective of the characters or he shoots in near darkness. He also with great effectiveness gives us the world as seen through the eyes of the ophthalmologists wife. She has accompanied her husband into the quarantine and is the one person there who can see. Why is she immune when the others arent? To answer that for sure one would have to be certain of the nature and larger meaning of the affliction. It could be dumb luck or it could be a question of character. In an early scene someone speculates that ""either panic caused the blindness or blindness caused the panic."" The rest is left to the audience. The one curious thing to note is that before the epidemic the wife as played by Julianne Moore seems an innocuous person almost boring like someone her handsome doctor husband might leave someday. Its an ongoing source of fascination in ""Blindness"" an arresting internal thread to accompany the external story to see true character gradually reveal itself. Surface personality goes away and were left with the real deal - which is the one thing people like about disasters after all. -- Advisory Dogs tearing the flesh off of corpses rape murder chaos misery and people being unpleasant with each other.

Blindness (R) Miramax (122 min.) Directed by Fernando Meirelles. With Julianne Moore. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO STARS A driver suddenly stops at an intersection unable to see. A prostitute loses her sight -- and is abandoned naked by her client. One by one a cosmopolitan city is filled with sightless doctors thieves secretaries children -- all stumbling about groping aimlessly toward they know not what. This is the beginning of ""Blindness"" and its a pretty weighty metaphor. A pretty elastic one too. Is this suddenly contagious affliction meant as a sign of our modern paranoia? As a stand-in for ignorance or faithlessness (as the movies finest most saintly character suggests). Or is the fact that the victims report feeling trapped in a snowstorm -- seeing nothing but white -- a suggestion of racism? Take your pick. Unfortunately symbols are no substitute for character. The characters have no names -- theyre The Doctors Wife or The Man With the Black Eye Patch -- but they have little distinction too rarely becoming little more than those identifying symbols. The Child. The Thief. We know little more about them at the end than at the beginning. The Doctors Wife for example is a kind of martyr -- when the contagious blind are quarantined she pretends to be sightless so she can go inside to tend to her husband. Its a genuinely holy act. But wheres her human fraility? Although shes a survivor she forgives almost everyone almost anything. She has a halo but little reality. Julianne Moore who stars does what she can with this as youd expect. Shes always been a performer able to create her own rich backstories; even if you werent sure of who her characters in ""Safe"" or ""Far From Heaven"" really were you never doubted she did. (My guess is that she sees this woman as deeply spiritual and tragically childless.) But shes still playing a construct not a character. Director Fernando Meirelles seems more lost. His great ""City of God"" showed an uncanny understanding of alternative societies and the lord-of-the-flies survivalism they can engender; his underrated ""The Constant Gardener"" was fascinated with the cold decisions of politics. So this storys twists -- as a terrified government abandons the infected in concentration camps and they begin to rule and misrule themselves -- clearly appealed. Yet theres nothing here to match the energy of ""City of God"" with many scenes so darkly lit its impossible to tell whats going on and his central image -- of characters stumbling their way through a milky whiteness -- tediously overused. And unlike ""The Constant Gardener"" there are no surprises here among the characters; the bad people behave badly the good one behaves well and the flawed folks in the middle make mistakes. ""Blindness"" is another one -- dully written ponderously paced and full of one-note characters acting exactly as wed expect. The original book -- by Nobel prize-winner Jose Saramago -- definitely contains possibilities. But Meirelles and screenwriter Don McKellar sadly cant see them. Rating note The film contains nudity sexual situations and violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

When resi dents of a nameless cosmo polis are suddenly struck blind the vagueness seems so deliberate that the allegory could be steering our attention to AIDS pacifism the surreal craziness of Latin American dictatorship or the Golden Rule. Director Fernando Meirelles (""The Constant Gardener"") situates the outbreak in an unidentified international-flavored city. When one man suddenly loses his sight while his car is stopped at a traffic light the shocking ease with which total strangers slip into bad Samaritanism sets the grim tone. You dont normally expect a movie to be this unpleasant to sit through unless its about the Holocaust or was directed by Edward Burns. Blindness seems to be contagious and soon so many people have been struck blind that an authoritarian government forces them into an abandoned mental hospital. Among them are an ophthalmologist (Mark Ruffalo) and his wife (Julianne Moore) who can see but pretends to be blind so she can look after her man. Why she alone is immune is a mystery; shes sort of like the doctor in ""The Plague."" As the wards fill up with helpless victims and the halls teem with human waste a younger man (Gael Garcia Bernal) declares himself dictator - first jokingly then not. Things that shouldnt matter anymore suddenly matter more than ever - race money jewels. The point is made with touches of black comedy and a mise-en-scene that suggests a claustrophobic apocalypse. The streets empty out. Everyone is afraid to drive when anyone else on the road can be struck blind at any moment. A mass rape played with the jauntiness of ""A Clockwork Orange"" led to more than a few walkouts at the screening I attended at the relatively unshockable Toronto Film Festival. A cinematographers toy box the movie suggests blindness by glare bursts of light overexposures double exposures shadows backlighting and characters speaking off camera. There are also a dozen other tricks that at times make you think the whole thing could be compressed a bit - to perhaps the length of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode which is basically what ""Blindness"" amounts to. I kept hoping the meaning would click into place but it never quite did. The story seems designed to apply to whatever fear is nibbling around your subconscious. If the moral is that we all ought to be nice to each other that isnt quite enough with which to close out such a strange sometimes harrowing and sometimes wicked movie. BLINDNESS Unfocused. Running time 121 minutes. Rated R (violence rape profanity nudity). At the Lincoln Square the Kips Bay the 34th Street others.

Blindness (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Blindness (R)  Right from the beginning you see where this is going. Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore. Photo credit Ken Woroner-Courtesy of Miramax Films. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald The heavy-handed allegory Blindness suggests that society teeters on the edge of chaos and that not much is required to shove us into anarchy and lawlessness. In the case of this inexplicably tedious film based on the bestselling novel by Jose Saramago the event is a sudden unexplained epidemic of vision loss that affects the population of an unnamed city. The unnamed bit is key because were dealing in allegory which is part (though not all) of the problem with the film which tries to make its already beaten-to-death point without ever giving us a reason to care about what happens. And some seriously dreadful events occur. The blind who see only a milky white glaze are quickly rounded up and shuttled off to a filthy abandoned hospital. Theyre guarded by sadistic military men and more or less left to fend for themselves and cleanliness and order quickly deteriorate. In their midst is a doctors wife (Julianne Moore) who can still mysteriously see but doesnt want to leave her foundering husband (Mark Ruffalo). Blindness touches briefly on the couples life before the epidemic but never bothers to introduce the rest of its afflicted characters before thrusting them into darkness. Theyre pawns standing in for humankind victims or predators identified not by name but by taglines. Old guy with an eye patch (Danny Glover). Hooker with a heart of gold (Alice Braga). Bad guy with a gun (Gael Garcia Bernal) who takes over the food supply and forces the rest of the inmates to fork over their valuables to eat. When hes collected all the watches and rings he demands the women. The ensuing mass rape scene should be far more horrifying than it actually is. One must ask in the name of logic If a desperate Julianne Moore keeps eyeing a useful pair of scissors found in the prostitutes purse wouldnt she use them before the worst occurred? Brazilian Fernando Meirelles (City of God City of Men) directed a dazzling version of John le Carres The Constant Gardener and he uses every cinematic trick in the book to keep the film visually interesting despite its claustrophobic setting. But he works the people have no insight into their shallow lives metaphor too hard. His film aims to be a cousin of Alfonso Cuarons harrowing Children of Men which also played out an apocalyptic scenario but with style and a more cinematic plotline and a central hero with whom the audience could relate. For all its pretension and artiness Blindness is more like M. Night Shyamalans The Happening (which at least had the decency to be fast-paced and short) right down to its upbeat and inane conclusion.

""Doctor"" (Mark Ruffalo) goes blind but ""Doctors Wife"" (Julianne Moore) can see in Blindness. Photo KEN WORONER MIRAMAX Blindness 1 / 1 Back to Gallery EVERY few minutes the screen whites out in Blindness. The lens turns on a chalky sky a splash of cream in coffee or a stretch of pale linoleum floor. In those moments we see the world as one of the films sightless characters might see it -- as though were trapped in a cloud. But Blindness is not about blindness. Advocates for the visually impaired might well object to its groping caricatures and grim slant on disability but this is not an exercise in realism. Its a parable. Based on the 1995 novel by Jose Saramago Fernando Meirelles awkward repulsive yet richly imagined film uses sightlessness as a trigger for the breakdown of society. It asks us how we behave and what we become when we cant see each other. And the answer isnt always pretty. ""I know that part inside of you with no name"" says one of the films few optimists a raspy wise man played by Danny Glover. ""Thats who we are right?"" The Glover fellow has no name; hes just ""Man with the Black Eye Patch"" and he dispenses insights where needed. The rest of the cast includes Mark Ruffalo as ""Doctor"" Julianne Moore as ""Doctors Wife"" Alice Braga as ""Woman with the Dark Glasses"" and a hideous manifestation of Gael Garcia Bernal as a bartender who dubs himself ""King of Ward Three."" All but Moores character go inexplicably blind -- ""like Im swimming in milk"" -- in an epidemic that cripples a large anonymous city. (Meirelles shot the film in Uruguay Ontario and Brazil and the results have a generic cosmopolitan gloss.) The first to lose his sight is a young Japanese motorist (Yusuke Iseya) at a busy intersection. The second is the thief who steals his car (Don McKellar who also wrote the screenplay). The third is a prostitute (i.e. Braga) who happens to be a patient of the eye doctor (i.e. Ruffalo) visited by the stricken Japanese motorist. The fourth to go blind is the doctor himself. When the afflicted are bundled off to quarantine in an abandoned hospital Moore -- resolute terrified acting up a storm -- feigns blindness and tags along. Initially the residents of Ward One fumble along in search of order finding their way with guide wires sorting out puddings at mealtime. Trash confusion and death increase with each new wave of arrivals. The rooms become uninhabitable. They seethe with infection and despair. With no supervision no society and no law the wards begin to turn on one another. And the folks in Ward Three are monsters. So wends Blindness toward the inner ring of hell. No Dantes the wrong allusion -- Sartre would be better. Hell is other people at least throughout the films sickening middle sections. In a few of its vilest most nihilistic bits the screen goes entirely black rather than white reflecting Moores POV as a sighted woman navigating the darkest crannies of human behavior. Meirelles has explored them before -- with brio in City of God with shaky-cam intensity in The Constant Gardener -- and each time hes managed to find beauty in the ugliness of lifes most savage truths. But in Blindness hes traded naturalism for a kind of avant-garde fabulism; with all those actors grabbling around bumping into furniture you might think youre watching an experimental theatre troupe. There are dashes of utopian and quasi-religious uplift to be found here especially at the end. Yet the films downer of a message recalls not Dante not Sartre not even previous sci-fi fables of raging pandemic (zombie cannibalism in 28 Days Later blindness in The Day of the Triffids) but another tale of social and moral collapse William Goldings Lord of the Flies. Minus civilization humanity sucks. End of story.

So few worthy fables are. When the characters in Fernando Meirelles disturbingly beautiful film ""Blindness"" are stricken they plunge into a world that looks fluid milky. The First Blind Man as he is referred to in the credits is sitting in a car at an intersection when he loses his sight. Is he at a crossroads? Of course he is. And so is the government that imposes a quarantine in Don McKellars adaptation of Nobel prize winner Jose Saramagos stunning parable. Other characters identified in the similarly vague yet specific ways cross paths at an ophthalmologists. The Doctor (Mark Rufallo) cant diagnose the illness. Then he and others he treated lose their vision. Played by consistently brave performer Julianne Moore The Doctors wife continues to see as the pandemic sweeps the unnamed city. She sees for us. Its a role she shirks embraces dodges and accepts. McKellar Gael Garcia Bernal and Danny Glover also star. ""Blindness"" leaves indelible images and unnerving feelings about physical and social disintegration. It is not easy to stomach. At first its tempting to dismiss the goverments heartlessness. No government would behave that way. No citizenry would let it. But treated as an allegory of say poverty the notion of hiding away the afflicted letting them rot doesnt seem so willful on the filmmakers part. Directed by Fernando Meirelles written by Don McKellar; from the Jose Saramago novel; starring Julianne Moore Mark Rufallo Alice Braga Gael Garcia Bernal Danny Glover Yosuke Iseya Yoshino Kimura.

The couple winds up in a clan alongside Ruffalos patients played by Danny Glover Yusuke Iseya Alice Braga Mitchell Nye and Yoshino Kimura.The early scenes of them all falling over one another and feeling their way along corridor walls suggests a particularly apocalyptic drama-class exercise OK now youre blind zombies. Don McKellars screenplay holds onto a few of Saramagos other devices that should keep it from working. We dont know what city this is (it looks like Tokyo Montreal Sao Paolo and Los Angeles combined into one) and the characters do not have names.But the lack of specificity and the comic pantomime start to matter less when the movies ideas begin to assert themselves. The asylum inmates are broken into wards one of which controls the distribution of provisions. Its run by Gael Garcia Bernal and the Falstaffian Maury Chaykin who make a perfectly reprehensible pair first demanding jewelry for food then sex. For the first half hour as all hell only threatens to break loose the people we meet are designer characters with expensive clothes and chic apartments; even Alice Bragas hooker is untouchably cool. I worried that the director Fernando Meirelles was creating another of his glamorous nightmares like ""City of God"" and ""The Constant Gardener."" But ""Blindness"" corrals its bourgeois characters into slummy conditions not to improve their humanity but to test it. Does pride matter in poverty and starvation and degrading terror? Theres nothing left for even Meirelles to glamorize. This is not to say that his filmmaking doesnt reach an arrestingly grim peak particularly before during and after the women in Moores ward hold hands and walk toward the men whove promised them food for their bodies. These sequences are dark and chaotic in a way that makes it impossible for anyone (us or the characters) to come out of the dreadfulness unscathed.The chaos Meirelles conjures is indeed living-dead movie stuff but the desperation is still shockingly real. So for that matter is the sanitation problem. The production designer Tule Peak and his crew have done a marvelous job giving us a stupefyingly trashed city as if the disaster were actually a garbage bomb. ""Blindness"" is a movie whose sense of crisis feels right on time even if the happy ending feels like a gratuitous emotional bailout. Meirelles ensures that the obviousness of the symbolism (in the global village the blind need guidance) doesnt negate the storys power nor the power of Moores performance. The more dehumanizing things get the fiercer she becomes. In another sort of movie this would be a job for Sigourney Weaver but Moore is just as fearsome. Actually with that pellucid skin and those innumerable freckles the actor reminded me of Isabelle Huppert who also supervised post-apocalyptic survival in director Michael Hanekes sadly underseen parable ""Time of the Wolf.""Could these two have been separated at birth with Moore opting for melodramatic anxiety and Huppert for improbable serenity? The sightless folks in ""Blindness"" have an imperious captain in Julianne Moore. When someone calls her a leader with vision its a hokey joke and yet nobodys kidding.

Ken Woroner/Miramax Films hide caption toggle caption Ken Woroner/Miramax Films Blind ambition Abandoned in lockup by the authorities the vision-challenged quarantined find themselves at the mercy of a bully ex-bartender (Gael Garcia Bernal). Ken Woroner/Miramax Films Fernando Meirelles begins his bleak fantasy Blindness with a driver who inexplicably loses his sight in the instant it takes a traffic light to turn from red to green. Shortly thereafter a stranger who drives the man home (and then steals his car) is himself struck blind; so is the first drivers wife and the taxi driver who takes the two of them to an optometrist (who finds nothing wrong). Also the optometrist and all his patients and almost everyone any of them comes into even glancing contact with. Pretty quickly its a pandemic. The optometrists wife (Julianne Moore) however does not go blind and in order to care for her husband (Mark Ruffalo) she accompanies him into government-ordered quarantine keeping her sightedness a secret for reasons best known to the author. This has the effect of offering audiences a window on whats happening but proves problematic as a plot point. Sequestered in a decrepit heavily guarded hospital-like facility these early victims are left to govern themselves as the plague spreads outside the walls at which point civilization inside gets shunted aside about as quickly as it does in Lord of the Flies. The descent into barbarism -- hallways fouled by human waste cruelty round every corner -- is both the device and the point of the source material a novel by Nobel Prize-winning Portuguese writer Jose Saramago. But novels and screenplays work differently and by the time an obstreperous former bartender (Gael Garcia Bernal) is declaring himself King of Ward 3 and forcing hungry prisoners to trade sex for food youll be wondering why Moore who still hasnt revealed her ability to see doesnt just walk up behind him and club him over the head. If its true that in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king then the two-eyed woman should be empress no? Well not in Blindness realm for reasons that feel more authorial and directorial than rational. That said Moore is always watchable Ruffalo and Bernal get a nice rivalry going without ever establishing eye contact (as it were) and Danny Glover has some nice moments in an underdeveloped part as an older man who finds to his benefit that love is blind. Theres also the neat cinematic conceit that conveys the ""white blindness"" that afflicts these folks -- theyre plunged not into darkness but into its opposite their vision blotted out by light flooding the screen. The director deploys that brightness in some of the same creepy ways that horror directors use darkness cutting to gleaming white floors and harsh white clouds to eerie effect. The device so intrigues him in fact that he builds scenes and transitions around it devoting his filmmaking energies to making the visual conceit work -- sometimes to the exclusion of elements (narrative say and character) that seem to interest him less.

You know the requisite scene in which the actress face stretches to its high-cheekboned limits in a look of utter anguish the tears streaming the teeth clenched chin atwitter. (Assignment to Final Cut Studio users Assemble a montage of Moore Moments from Children of Men Freedomland Magnolia et cetera et cetera.) And why not? If you were Moores nameless wife in Fernando Meirelles hopelessly arty apocalyptic parable youd be in the throes of agony too. Abruptly inexplicably in an unnamed city the population is turning blind. The government proclaims a ""state of crisis"" and the afflicted their vision gone save for seeing a skein of whiteness are quarantined in rundown prisonlike barracks. The food is tossed to them by jittery guards like zookeepers throwing meat at beasts in a cage. Panic spreads along with the contagion and since Blindness is populated by types not people - no one has a name and everyone identifies themselves by their occupation (""pharmacists assistant"" ""hotel maid"" ""accountant"") - it isnt difficult to draw analogies Katrina the Wall Street meltdown pick your epic calamity. Irony of ironies Moores husband (Mark Ruffalo) is an ophthalmologist - he goes blind not long after a distraught Japanese patient struck by sudden sightlessness comes in for help. In many ways Blindness is remindful of last years cheesy sci-fi hit The Mist in which smalltowners get trapped in a supermarket as a menacing cloud descends triggering fear and ignoble behavior. If Stephen King had grown up French reading Sartre he could have written Blindness. Murky and grainy and showing human beings at their grimmest - thievery rape betrayal murder - Blindness is no barrel of laughs. But it is a barrel of pretentious metaphorical musings. And it serves the picture no good whatsover that the cast (with a key exception) has to stagger around pretending not to see. Acting is all about making contact imbuing characters with life. Thats not easy when the dialogue is flat and generic and the performers by necessity of the plot cant look one another in the eye.A A A  - Steven Rea Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

Make that Vision with a decidedly capital V. In his effort to make a grand statement Meirelles piles on the drama as well as the affectations. The resulting effect dilutes the films power. I have not read Jose Saramagos novel on which the film is based but Blindness the film version has the definite feel of a film that has lost something in translation from page to screen - most likely all semblance of subtlety. The film begins with a driver (Yusuke Iseya) in a crowded citys network of freeways suddenly losing his sight. (Characters are never identified by name.) He winds up at the office of an eye doctor (Mark Ruffalo) who cant make the diagnosis - theres no reason for him to be blind. Plus he doesnt ""see"" dark; everything has gone white. The doctor goes blind too as do a growing number of the citys population. The government moves to quarantine everyone who has lost sight including the doctor. His wife (Julianne Moore) does not go blind but she fakes blindness so that she can accompany him to the abandoned mental hospital where patients are being held. The government has given up on them - there is no supervision leaving people to fend for themselves. They form groups but eventually the makeshift societies begin to break down as the self-proclaimed King of Ward Three (Gael Garcia Bernal ruthless remorseless and excellent) wages a savage campaign to control things. At first Moores characters ability to see is an advantage. But she cant give her secret away for fear of being exposed and expelled. Thus shes more painfully aware of the situation yet largely unable to change it. Meirelles goes to great lengths to give us visual evidence of the increasingly disgusting conditions as well as the growing desperation of the people inside. The message is fairly simple As a crucial element of living in a society is taken away the society breaks down reverting to its base nature. Yet for all that in the best part of humanity - in this case Moores stoic selfless tireless heroine - there is a glimmer of hope a chance that society can be reborn. It is a fairly obvious point that Meirelles drives home like a piano dropped from a 10th-story window. Moore is reliably good though one hopes for her character to take action long before she does. Ruffalo also is solid. Bernal is the most compelling character but hes not around enough to make the indelible impression he might have. The real star here is Meirelles who evidently never met a stylized setup he didnt like. It makes Blindness interesting enough to look at but nothing happens in the film that you couldnt see coming.

"Movie review Blindness -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Blindness -- 3 out of 5 stars A mysterious illness is striking the worlds population blind. The blind populace is quarantined but the wife of a victim (Julianne Moore) follows her love into the camp and has to use her sight to help those inside. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Fascinating as sci-fi paltry as a parable Blindness is one of the movie years most daring failures. This fable about an epidemic of ""white blindness"" from the gritty Brazilian Fernando Meirelles looks and feels like an I Am Legend for grown ups.In a modern cosmopolitan city a driver stops in traffic. He has gone blind but hes not in the dark. All he can see is white light. The man who offers to drive him home and then steals his car suffers a similar fate. The ophthalmologist he visits (Mark Ruffalo) is stumped. And then he too is infected. Julianne Moore is the doctors simpler wife a woman who wonders if this possibly psychosomatic illness has to do with faith a literal losing ones way. As the contagion spreads and her husband is among those carted off to quarantine she goes with him. But she can still see. Shes immune.The film settles in behind the bars of the long-closed asylum where the wife keeps her secret and becomes caretaker and nurse to the newly blind. People whose lives crossed dont realize it. A hooker is held with a pharmacist she insulted the thief with the man whose car he stole the patients of the doctors medical practice all locked up on pain of death by a paranoid military working on behalf of a paranoid nation. The blind stumble about abandon clothes and live in their own filth. The husband-wife dynamic is reversed as he becomes totally dependent on her. They have no idea whats happening in the nation at large.Eventually competing wards form into a Lord of the Flies as the strong and thug-like led by a bartender ( Gael Garcia Bernal) prey on the rest holding the dwindling food supplies hostage.Meirrelles (The Constant Gardener City of God) working from a Jose Saramago novel plays around with light and sight blurring or over-saturating his images cutting off heads in conversations (think The Diving Bell and the Butterfly). He creates one of the most vivid screen end-of-the-world dystopias of recent memory.But aside from a few cracks about the wife as ""a leader with vision"" there doesnt seem to be much point. Theres no moral to the story save the one we can all guess when we hear this films plot. When civilization breaks down humanity goes out the window. You dont need 20/20 vision to see that.

A Japanese man goes blind in traffic. The same fate befalls the man who steals his car as well as the eye doctor (Mark Ruffalo) who attends them both. Suddenly its happening all over town as victims are quarantined in the cages of an abandoned mental institution. The doctors wife (Julianne Moore who is lately working above and beyond the call of duty in one bad movie after another) pretends shes blind too so she can bravely accompany her husband to the isolation ward. While the government and the scientists debate funding cures and research the populace is left to its own insanity and filth. In the darkness panic ensues. Infected victims are preyed upon by other inmates abused by the guards and forced to sleep in their own excrement. Gael Garcia Bernal plays a bartender who takes over the food supply and declares himself king of the blind raping the women in exchange for bread and water. As a microcosm of civilized society reduced to primitive lawlessness they discover sex violence greed hunger and murder sacrificing their sense of pride morality dignity and self-respect. After the horror of the cages the real hell awaits in the sunlight outside as the grimy ravaged and courageous Ms. Moore leads the survivors to file through empty railroad cars filled with decaying corpses through streets of starving people fighting off packs of wild dogs feasting on human flesh. The extremes are so barbaric few audiences will sit through them and despite the allegorical intentions the apocalyptic literary views in the Jose Saramago novel upon which it is based fail to translate coherently to the screen. Finally they see but then the milky white film covers their eyes once more. Are they all going blind again? What does it all mean? Nothing about Blindness ever makes any real sense; you go away feeling lousy and it is hateful to look at. I have never seen floors filled with the contents of waste from overflowing toilets (to put it politely) photographed with so much misguided artsy-craftsiness. Worst of all the torture slugs along for more than two hours. Its hard to believe the films Canadian screenwriter and co-star Don McKellar is the same man who won the 2006 Tony award for writing the delicious Broadway musical The Drowsy Chaperone. And its getting tiresome watching the glorious Julianne Moore waste her talents playing so many resilient clueless sufferers. This is one movie where sightlessness might be a blessing. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under Blindness Danny Glover Gael Garcia Bernal Julianne Moore Mark Ruffalo movie On the Town Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2008/arts-culture/darkness-visible,200,blindness25,blindness,observer
"Blindness | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blindness ) Blindness (Canada/Brazil/Japan 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli It has been said that one of the greatest fears expressed by human beings is to be suddenly struck blind - plunged into a blankness into which sound but no light can penetrate. Imagine this happening not to one person but to an entire population. Those who are blind from birth or lose their sight over time develop means of coping. In a case where vision is suddenly stripped away en masse the result would be widespread panic. The degree to which society would crumble and fall into oblivion is a matter of individual interpretation but this is the underlying premise of director Fernando Meirelles Blindness a dark intellectually challenging adaptation of the novel by Jose Saramago. A meditation on isolation and primal urges Blindness could loosely be classified as a post-apocalyptic story but the ""event"" that occurs in this scenario isnt something as prosaic as a nuclear holocaust or a lethal plague. Instead its a sickness that renders everyone in the world blind except one woman. To quote Erasmus ""In the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king."" The disease which instantaneously blinds those infected by it strikes quickly beginning with a Patient Zero (Yusuke Iseya) and spiraling out of control by impacting everyone with whom he has contact. Soon its an epidemic and the government unsure how to control the problem sets up a concentration camp and dumps every blind person into it. Included in that population are the doctor (Mark Ruffalo) who first examined Patient Zero a prostitute with dark glasses (Alice Braga) a young boy and several others. The doctors wife (Julianne Moore) is also there. Although still able to see she fakes blindness so she can accompany her husband into this hell-on-Earth. Within the concentration camp attempts to establish order soon collapse and it becomes survival of the fittest with a self-proclaimed king (Gael Garcia Bernal) using a gun to take control of the food supply and force everyone to accept his rule. But the doctors wife possesses a weapon no one else has sight. Blindness is a fascinating intellectual exercise that explores how conditions and relationships might devolve in a closed community such as this one. Stripped of an element most humans believe to be crucial to civilization some men and women find other more basic ways to communicate while others seek to use the weakness of their fellows as a path to domination. Meirelles (who previously helmed City of God and The Constant Gardener) repeatedly asks viewers to place themselves in the group alongside the doctors wife. We are complicit with her - the only ones who can see the conditions as they develop rather than hear and imagine them. Sometimes even the seeing can be blind - as is the case with the doctor who misses the bond that develops between her husband and the prostitute until it can no longer be ignored. The biggest negative associated with Blindness has little to do with its narrative or structure but with Meirelles hyperstylized approach to realizing the story on-screen. While some of the lengthy moment of darkness (such as when the seeing Julianne Moore finds herself entering a place without light) are successful in setting mood and developing a level of tension the bleaching of images and frequent white flashes are more often distracting than efficacious. When a style or approach overwhelms the substance of the story the director risks losing his audience and this occurs on more than one occasion during the course of this production. Blindness makes no attempt to explain the cause of the disease or why one person is immune. Those things are irrelevant and represent establishing circumstances that have to be accepted for the story to work. The movie is about exploring how humanity might respond in a situation like this and the response that is shown can be extrapolated to other situations. Blindness is about human nature and shows both the positives and the negatives inherent in it. With its loose narrative structure and limited character development (we learn nothing about the pasts of any of the half-dozen significant individuals populating this picture) Blindness has the potential to confound and frustrate some viewers. On the other hand there are those who like me will see this as an absorbing (if admittedly flawed) thought-piece. It engaged me throughout and I found the ending to be surprisingly hopeful.

By Anthony Lane Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore in a movie by Fernando Meirelles.   Credit DANIEL HERTZBERG Things go awry in ""Blindness"" from the start. In a busy unnamed city a traffic light changes to green but one car fails to move. ""Im blind"" the driver a Japanese guy cries pawing at his eyes. In the ensuing melee--and this sets the tone for the rest of the film--what matters is not the plight of the stricken man but the response of those around him. As his sight falters so his other senses are assailed horns bray behind him voices rise in protest and he whacks his head on the cars doorframe as he tries to get out. Finally a passerby comes to his aid takes the wheel drives him home and steals the car. This uncompromising view of our condition comes from Fernando Meirelles the director of ""City of God"" (2002) and ""The Constant Gardener"" (2005) both of which relied on a similar brilliant bullying. ""Blindness"" was adapted from the book of the same name by the Portuguese novelist and Nobel laureate Jose Saramago; the script is by Don McKellar who also plays the car thief. The movie clings tight to the events of the book which begin with a plotted briskness but soon unroll into a chain of successive miseries. Thus the Japanese man (Yusuke Iseya) is taken by his wife (Yoshino Kimura) to an ophthalmologist (Mark Ruffalo) who is baffled by this sudden loss of sight--there is nothing physically wrong with the mans eyes--and says as much over dinner to his wife ( Julianne Moore). By the next day the doctor too is blind. And so it goes on with marginal characters groping unsteadily to the heart of the action the doctors receptionist for example plus a kid who was sitting in the waiting room. They have all caught the infection and yet there is no disease. The sufferers are rounded up and herded into a quarantine ward in what looks like a disused hospital or jail with armed guards preventing their escape. The other wards fill up fast and flickers of information from the outside suggest that the whole city has gone blind and perhaps the world beyond. It doesnt take long for the place to fester; soon there are naked figures no longer bothering to dress wandering through corridors littered with filth human and otherwise. The doctor who is kindly efficient and frankly a little boring tries to maintain order. In the opposing corner we have a young barman (Gael Garcia Bernal) representing the Hobbesian or inherently beastly team. ""I hereby declare myself the king of Ward Three"" he says before commandeering the meagre food supplies and agreeing to release them as and when the women offer themselves for rape. We duly reach the pit of this descent a single file of females linking hands and lining up to be violated in perpetual night. There are many precedents for such horror in recent history as in art. The greatest of these is ""The Parable of the Blind"" painted by Bruegel the Elder in 1568 in which a similar group each grabbing on to the next marches in a grim diagonal toward the lower right-hand corner where one of them has sprawled into a ditch. This is what Jesus foresaw for the scribes and the Pharisees and the moral caution bristles with rank and smellable detail under the painters touch from the begging bowl at one mans waist to the orbless accusing eyes that another turns on us in pleading or rebuke. ""See if you can still see where wickedness will lead you"" the look on his face says and Meirelles is issuing the same challenge with his movie aiming Bruegel-high. That is why he opens with traffic choked not merely with pollutants but with the emissions of our haste and rage and why he closes two hours later with the prospect of paradise regained around a dinner table and with a hint of sight restored. It was all our fault and the healing is up to us. The trouble with ""Blindness"" is that its so preoccupied with shouldering this symbolic weight that it gradually forgets to tell a story--to keep faith with the directives of common sense. Julianne Moore for instance accompanies her husband into quarantine even though inexplicably she can still see; but why does she keep that gift a secret instead of crowning herself the good queen of Ward Three? Maybe its because like everyone else she doesnt have a name. That is also true of Saramagos fable; just because namelessness is a commonplace in modern fiction however (see Kafkas ""In the Penal Colony"" for its most terrifying use) does not mean that it translates to the screen. Any attempt to blank out movie characters--after all we know the names of the actors playing them--feels both precious and in the case of Meirelless film counterintuitive. If everyone were struck blind names would surely become more not less crucial as one means of identification was lost we would grasp eagerly at another. In these and other ways ""Blindness"" feels at once honorably serious and way too pleased with its own soothsaying. You stagger from the dimness of the cinema beaten down and longing for the light. The new Jonathan Demme film ""Rachel Getting Married"" is mostly set in a rambling house in Connecticut. In terms of entertainment its the sort of place that would once have had a piano a radio and a pair of parakeets. These days with a wedding going on every brand of live music seems to be available jazz hip-hop and samba with the performers in their bejewelled bikinis looking a mite chilly for the time of year. Demme is a genial filmmaker light on his feet forever taken aback--even embarrassed--by the way in which his stories drift toward pain. That was true of ""Something Wild"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" in which terror and black comedy rolled together like dice and its there in the mood swings of ""Rachel Getting Married""--a minor work but so menaced by distress that the characters take every opportunity to dance the dark away. Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt) is marrying Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe) at the home of her father Paul (Bill Irwin) and his second wife Carol (Anna Deavere Smith). Everyone is invited including Rachels sister Kym (Anne Hathaway) who is being let out of rehab for the occasion. For a second you dont realize that it is Hathaway such is the force of her foul mouth and the severity of her cropped hair. Then the famous smile kicks in though it feels more like a nervous reaction than like a sign of joy. Its a hugely annoying performance but I suspect an accurate one for Kym is one of natures annoyers somehow insuring that every conversation spins around her; where friends and relatives at the prenuptial supper hymn the happy couple Kym prefers to stress her own unhappiness as a drug addict discussing her twelve-step program and babbling to the verge of free association. All of this was shot in high-definition video and its a close match for the swoop and rush of Kyms speech patterns and behavioral tics--too close you could argue luring Demme into a hyperactivity of his own. The film is endlessly sociable with people crowding the camera as if in a documentary yet sometimes you want that camera to draw back and watch them from a distance--to see how they mill around in the frame rather than shifting the frame itself. The wedding party is the ultimate guide to Demmes benign vision the groom is black the bride is white she and her bridesmaids are dressed in saris nobody so much as mentions race and the officiating priest is played by Demmes cousin Father Robert Castle about whom he made a fine film ""Cousin Bobby"" in 1992. I dont know if there were any Republican voters involved in this movie but if so it must have been a lonely time. Just imagine if the rest of the crew found out they would pin you down and sing to you until you changed your mind. Only once was the music too much for me. This was when Sidney faced his beloved during the ceremony and suddenly instead of reciting lines from the Book of Common Prayer started chanting Neil Youngs ""Unknown Legend"" unaccompanied right in her face ""She rides a Harley-Davidson / Her long brown hair flyin in the wind."" For some reason Rachel goes ahead and marries him but it must have been a nasty shock. These passages of hippieish affection are weirdly if deliberately out of kilter with the need and anger flyin around elsewhere. Kym has sex with the best man (another recovering addict) within minutes of her arrival; she borrows her dads car and trashes it in the woods; she attends the wedding with a black eye. Most upsetting of all is a fight she gets into with her mother played by Debra Winger. Why dont we see more of Winger these days? She sidles into the fringes of the film identifies its core concern--Kyms broken bond of trust with her parents stemming from an incident years before--and nails it with one terrible swing of her fist. She and Hathaway slug it out like cowboys and for a moment the civilized front of the film is rent from top to bottom. The hopeful welcoming side of Demme falls away and we are back with something wild.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Ironic no? And heres what is even more cockeyed Though its directed with a fondness for stylized blur shadow and bleached imagery by Fernando Meirelles who gave slums a hip-hop gloss in City of God this self-consciously moody adaptation is based on a 1995 novel by the Portuguese Nobel Prize winner Jose Saramago thats the opposite of gussied up. On the page in fact Saramagos compelling parable spills out in an urgent rush of unadorned language. I suspect the culprit is a case of middlebrow glaucoma -- a condition of glazed cloudiness that sometimes affects movies chasing the prestige of admired literature. But whatever the diagnosis the ailment takes a toll on an honorable cast that includes Mark Ruffalo Danny Glover and Gael Garcia Bernal among the squabbling unseeing crowd and Julianne Moore as the one sighted witness; she feigns blindness to be with her husband (Ruffalo) when he?s quarantined. As the players enact the fall and rebirth of civilization Meirelles suggests that even a society gone to hell looks better with a little music-video-like pizzazz.

The personal and mass chaos that would result if the human race lost its sense of vision is conveyed with diminished impact and an excess of stylish tics in ""Blindness"" an intermittently harrowing but diluted take on Jose Saramagos shattering novel. Despite a characteristically strong performance by Julianne Moore as a lone figure who retains her eyesight bearing sad but heroic witness to the horrors around her Fernando Meirelles slickly crafted drama rarely achieves the visceral force tragic scope and human resonance of Saramagos prose. Despite marquee names mixed reviews might yield fewer eyes than desired for this international co-production. Saramago who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1998 long resisted the idea of having his 1995 masterwork adapted for the bigscreen. Meirelles has proven the Portuguese writers instincts to be sadly correct. A horror tale a bleak allegory and a chronicle of human suffering as consoling as it is devastating ""Blindness"" emerges onscreen both overdressed and undermotivated scrupulously hitting the novels beats yet barely approximating so to speak its vision. A deliberately unspecified but primarily English-speaking city is experiencing an outbreak of what becomes known as the ""white sickness"" causing stricken individuals to lose their eyesight seeing nothing but white rather than darkness. First to succumb is a driver (Yusuke Iseya) who suddenly goes blind behind the wheel; his condition also afflicts his wife (Yoshino Kimura) the doctor (Mark Ruffalo) who examines him and several other patients at the latters office just for starters. The only one who proves inexplicably immune to the rapidly spreading contagion is the doctors wife (Moore) who conceals this fact so as to accompany her husband to the abandoned mental asylum where the blind are placed under government quarantine. As the wards become crowded with internees guarded by soldiers ready to fire at anyone who tries to escape ""Blindness"" paints a despairing picture of humanity under siege. Yet where the novel derived its power from a gradual painstakingly detailed account of deteriorating conditions inside the prison Meirelles resorts to visual shorthand and montage. In a manner more expedient than plausible food grows scarce the corridors become strewn with human waste and a violent faction led by one gun-toting refugee (played by Gael Garcia Bernal) begins demanding payment of the most humiliating kind from the female internees. Tastefully shot and staged the rape scene disturbs but also exemplifies the films willingness to flinch from a work that on the page is utterly unflinching. Burdened with the ability to see the world going blind and mad around her the doctors wife acting as a stand-in for the audience takes violent decisive action that triggers a breakout from the asylum. Moore gets ample opportunity to show both unrestrained tears and clenched resolve as the woman who bravely leads a small group to freedom including her husband the first blind man and his wife a beautiful young woman (Meirelles vet Alice Braga) and an old man (Danny Glover). Latter also provides incessant voiceover narration that accompanied by the intrusive dirge-like wailing of the score tries in vain to fill in for the philosophical asides wry humor and gorgeous epiphanies of Saramagos voice. Foregoing the vibrant furiously overheated visual style he brought to ""City of God"" and ""The Constant Gardener"" (the editing by ""City of Gods"" Daniel Rezende is noticeably less frenzied) Meirelles adopts a cooler but in its own way no less fussy aesthetic. He often floods the screen in luminous white to mimic the sensation of blindness at other times bathing his characters in the stuff so they appear to be in ones words ""swimming in milk."" This deliberately artificial effect gives the film a stagy self-conscious air a feeling only heightened by the book-inspired conceit of not giving the characters names. Tule Peakes production design impresses with the transformation of the sterile mental ward to squalid ninth circle of hell and Meirelles vision of the outside world littered with rubbish as extras stagger blindly about is no less convincing. Pic was lensed in Ontario Brazil and Uruguay and appropriately enough the city in which its set looks both vaguely familiar and effectively otherworldly.
