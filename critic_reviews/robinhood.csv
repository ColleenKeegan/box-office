By Peter Rainer Film critic May 14 2010 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image from left Russell Crowe  Alan Doyle Scott Grimes and Kevin Durand are shown in a scene from Robin Hood. David Appleby/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Do we really need another Robin Hood in the movies? From the high points of Errol Flynn and Sean Connery to the low point of Kevin Costner - Robin Hood as surfer dude - I think weve had quite enough already. But never underestimate Hollywoods penchant for revisionism - i.e. the recycling of old goods into new money. The revisitionist bug has claimed Superman and Batman so I guess Robin Hood was inevitable. So let me put this another way Do we really need a revisionist Robin Hood?After seeing Ridley Scotts ""Robin Hood"" starring Russell Crowe I would unhesitantly answer that question in the negative. I much prefer Mel Brookss ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"" to all this doomy somberness. Why take the legend so seriously?It would be different I suppose if Scott and his screenwriter Brian Helgeland were trying for some kind of grand-scale epic a la ""Lawrence of Arabia."" That wasnt merely an epic-sized film - it was an epic of ideas. There are no big ideas knocking around in ""Robin Hood"" no vision beyond the rudimentary Life was really really grim way back in AD 1199. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? IN PICTURES Past Robin Hoods Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gallery Past Robin Hoods In Pictures Cannes Film Festival 2010 Ill say this much for Scott. He doesnt make it look as if the Brits back then not to mention the invading French belonged to a dental plan. One of my big complaints about historical movies is that people are always sporting Pepsodent smiles. Not in ""Robin Hood."" The not-so Merry Men in particular look as if they could use some instruction in flossing.In Scotts version of the Robin Hood legend Robin Longstride is a Briton serving with King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) during the interminable Crusades. Fighting his way like a Zen archer through France on his return from the Holy Land he ends up in possession of the killed kings crown and passes himself off as Sir Robert Loxley Nottinghams knight of the realm to Richards snivelling successor King John (Oscar Isaac). He then ventures to Nottingham to present the sword of the actual Robert Loxley slain in battle to Loxleys infirm father Sir Walter (a too-good-for-this-movie Max von Sydow) who though blind discerns that Robin would be an excellent match for Roberts flinty widow Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett).Since we know that Robin and Marion are destined for the ages not to mention the fine movie starring Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn the slow-burn buildup that Scott gives these incipient lovebirds strikes me as being way too coy. (He asks her to help remove his chain mail). Not to mention drab. This must be the first sort-of romance in movie history in which neither participant ever cracks a wide smile. Scott makes the mistake of equating seriousness with humorlessness and his actors follow suit. Crowe has never been big on levity but his smoldering blahness here makes his gladiator in Scotts (overrated) ""Gladiator"" seem like Jiminy Cricket. Blanchett is strong as always but the role itself is misconceived. No doubt to avoid the usual damsel-in-distress cliches endemic to the genre she and Scott overcorrect by turning Marion into a cross between Gloria Steinem and Lara Croft.If all you are looking for from this movie is a medieval smackdown between Brits and Frenchies you wont leave feeling famished. But for anything more than that for a trace of poetry or grace or romance youll probably feel the way Richard the Lionheart did when last we see him - i.e. dead. We never even get to see Robin steal from the rich and give to the poor. Thats because the film is a prequel in search of a sequel. With any luck we wont get one. Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for violence including intense sequences of warfare and some sexual content.)RelatedA new interpretation of Robin Hood?

By Anthony Lane Cate Blanchett and Russell Crowe in Ridley Scotts new movie.   Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell What do you get if you mix ""Gladiator"" ""The Return of Martin Guerre"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" ""Elizabeth"" ""Troy"" ""The Seventh Seal"" and a hundred buckets of mud? The answer is ""Robin Hood""--the latest version that is directed by Ridley Scott. Our hero is one Robin Longstride played by Russell Crowe who seems a bit short for the name; it suggests someone rangy whereas the dauntless persona that Crowe has constructed over many films owes less to his gait than to his lightly submerged temper and his bearish build. The solution would have been to call him Robin Phonethrow but Scott has a thing for historical details so I guess that didnt wash. We first encounter Robin in France at the butt end of the twelfth century. He is part of an unruly British force hacking its way back home from a Crusade under the command of King Richard (Danny Huston). The King dies under castle walls from an arrow to the neck--as did the real Lionheart and as did Richard Harris when he played the role in ""Robin and Marian"" (1976) although that movie stressed the parched futility of the scene whereas Scott brings us boiling oil and heaving hordes. The result cleaves so close to the opening of Scotts ""Gladiator"" that you half wonder whether he filmed the two stories back to back and held this one in reserve for ten years. Crowe certainly has the air of a man who has darted off camera swapped his Latin grammar for a longbow and returned to the fray. The only substantial difference is his accent which in ""Gladiator"" was a rootless growl but which now takes careful aim at a Nottinghamshire burr before veering so wildly off course that Robin sounds like an Ulsterman trying to imitate John Lennon. Also on hand is Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge) a knight of the realm who is waylaid and slaughtered in a French glade by the glowering Godfrey (Mark Strong) a traitor so unscrupulous that he takes orders and oysters from the French king. Longstride who chances upon the same glade--the whole movie seethes with geographical unlikelihood--inherits not just the sword but also the identity of the dying man. Its a long days journey into knighthood and it takes him across the Channel up the Thames and eventually to Nottingham where he meets Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) the sightless father of the deceased. Will the old man notice the difference? You can feel Scott and his screenwriter Brian Helgeland toying here with notions of camouflage and doubling--themes that pierce to the heart of Hood lore. Nothing about him is more slippery than his social status which has shifted alarmingly over time. According to J. C. Holt in his 1982 study of the legend ""There is no doubt about Robins status. He is a yeoman not a peasant nor a knight still less a dispossessed nobleman."" Such at any rate is the hero first mentioned in medieval poems and ballads--a man without a Marion without any connection to King Richard with no thought of robbing the rich to pay the poor. All these are later encrustations as is the theory given dramatic form by the playwright Anthony Munday in 1598 that Robin was in fact the Earl of Huntingdon cleverly slumming it as a commoner. That is a baseless but compelling fiction to which centuries later the cinema was instinctively drawn; Allan Dwan turned to the Huntingdon fable for his crisp and spacious ""Robin Hood"" of 1922 with Douglas Fairbanks in the title role. Even more telling was the genesis of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" Michael Curtizs Technicolor pageant of 1938 which began in an early draft with Robin as a yeoman--and with James Cagney no less in line to play him--but cranked him up the ranks until in the finished film he became Sir Robin of Locksley immortalized by a beaming Errol Flynn. (Mind you wait a few more decades and you find the fellow sinking back down to a point where the grizzled creaky Hood of ""Robin and Marian"" played by Sean Connery can be fondly derided by his monarch as a ""peasant bastard."") And so when Crowes Robin tells his pals ""There is no difference between a knight and any other man"" what he claims is both demonstrably absurd and somehow true to the deep liberating elusiveness of Robinry through the ages. All of which makes it surprising that Scott having raised the subject of an alter ego tosses it aside. Robin drops his pretense whereupon for some reason Sir Walter invites him to hang around anyway as a replacement heir--and an ersatz husband for Marion (Cate Blanchett) Sir Roberts widow who looks none too wowed by the arrangement. Not that Longstride gets to rut with the fair lady; this is a family movie so she takes the downy bed and he has to lie on the floor beside a deerhound. Before long however Robin starts to prove himself pilfering seed grain that was destined for the Church and sowing it in local fields. The Church is as usual the institutional villain taking its place in a roster of foes whose competing depredations confuse the film no end. First we have Godfrey; followed by the French (a perennial standby); King John (Oscar Isaac) the petulant invertebrate now on the English throne; and at the bottom of the heap the Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfadyen). Oh dear. Why hire Macfadyen who made an astringent Mr. Darcy in the recent ""Pride and Prejudice"" and then muscle him out of the movie? My suspicion is that after the embarrassment of ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" (1991) when Alan Rickman as the Sheriff stole from Kevin Costner and gave to the viewers a dictate was nailed to every tree in Hollywood declaring that the tale belongs to Robin and to him alone. Such honor should please Russell Crowe but he--like the movie around him--looks distinctly underjoyed. He is a brooder by trade not a reveller and that served him well in films like ""The Insider"" and ""Master and Commander"" (pasted together those titles pretty much sum up his appeal). His Robin however seems pathologically glum; even when leading a cavalry charge on a white steed he cuts a lonesome figure marooned in his own feuds and ruminations. ""The more the merrier"" he says at one point but was there ever a Hoodist saga more leached of merriment? We find Little John (Kevin Durand) Allan ADayle (Alan Doyle) and Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes) quaffing mead and leering at wenches in the tavern but if you asked me which of those guys was which Im afraid I would go blank so casual is the sketching of their characters. Scott is no more interested in the companionable backslapping aspect of previous Robins than his director of photography John Mathieson is in the emerald glitter of a forest. Instead all is dour and dun. We are a long way from Errol Flynn marching in with a deer slung over his shoulder or from the Fairbanks who didnt merely scamper and swing from one errand of justice to the next. He skipped. So what? Is the myth of Hood not open for reimagining precisely because it is a myth perhaps the most malleable we possess? ""There is a quiverful of possible Robin Hoods. Even the likeliest is little better than a shot in the gloaming."" That is J. C. Holts assessment and Stephen Knight in ""Robin Hood A Complete Study of the English Outlaw"" (1994) goes further arguing that the quest for a ""real"" Robin may be beside the point and that what matters is the ""forcefield of variations"" that surrounds the core image of the outlaw. Yet for all that we sense in our bones when something in the myth goes awry--when for example Crowe is seen galloping to the fight along a seashore. Everything about Robin in whatever incarnation speaks surely of an inland man one who finds sanctuary in woods and patterns of behavior that are beyond the pale. As Flynn and Fairbanks grasped he should be more Puckish than Arthurian his rebellious raids upon authority keeping him light on his feet which is why an overt parody such as Mel Brookss ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"" (1993) feels so redundant. How can you mock a tradition already ripe with laughter? There is a tempting overture to Scotts film in which we are introduced to a bunch of kids--the orphaned offspring of men gone to war--who dwell in Sherwood Forest emerging only to steal. They are merry men in waiting as well as fugitive ancestors of the Lost Boys in ""Peter Pan"" but once again Scott neglects the promise of his own subplot and reverts to the lower spirits of his hero who retains not a scintilla of youthful glee. (Although we get a few flashbacks to Robins traumatized childhood nobody is less in need of a backstory he is the creature of a perpetual now.) True in the final moments an arrow whistles cheerfully in from nowhere and pins the Sheriff s denunciation of the bandit to a tree; but that was how Fairbankss Robin chose to announce his presence almost ninety years ago when film was green. ""And so the legend begins"" the new movie tells us at the end. But its too late.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Billed as a precursor to the legend we know its rich in bogus historical context along with enough mud blood and clutter to overwhelm our happy memories of Errol Flynns grin and Olivia de Havillands radiance. Here Robin and Marian are played by a scowling Russell Crowe and a grim Cate Blanchett who has the face of a wooden squaw stained by decades of cigar smoke. I cant remember a more un-fun-looking couple. Scott convinced he has much to say about oppression and social justice presents a Robin who returns from the Crusades with post-traumatic-stress disorder after helping to slaughter tens of thousands of guiltless Muslims and goes on to write the Magna Carta. In between he travels to Nottingham and informs Marian of her husbands death. Amid all the gritty mucky barnyard realism Blanchett receives the bad news with a mask of stoicism turns away from Crowe totters puts a fluttery hand to her heart and promptly regains her composure. Its Blanche DuBois Goes Medieval. Crowe follows this spectacle by taking a bath which allows the newly single Blanchett to behold him in his jiggly splendor. While the aging stars grit their teeth and pretend to be sweet on each other a bald French spy affecting an English accent pushes King John to tax his subjects so ruthlessly that the French will be able to cruise across the Channel and plate escargot by suppertime. In a Ridley Scott film war is hellon the eyes and ears. He jams together disparate whackings and hackings and uses a flickery quasi-slow-motion as if he thinks it will smooth out the gaps in continuity. If his aim is to deglamorize battle he misses the most vital component of humanism to present the dead as individuals instead of anonymous founts of CGI gore. As in Gladiator it all comes down to righteous vengeance. Robin leads the Saxons against the French pig-dogs who skewered Max von Sydow as Marians blind father-in-lawa cause we embrace because Von Sydow alone among the hams seems to be having a good time. The first printed verse to refer to the figure of Robin Hood (who probably existed) is this from the thirteenth or fourteenth century Lithe and Lysten gentylmen / That be of frebore blode I shall tell of a good yeman / His name was Robyn Hode / Robyn was a proude outlawe / Whyles he walked on grounde / So curteyse an outlawe as he was one / Was never none found. Read it out loud. It has the swing the panache of the FlynnMichael Curtiz production of The Adventures of Robin Hood in all its goofy Technicolor romanticism. Heres an example of Ridley Scotts modern revisionist sensibility Waiting for the Frenchies to land Robin throws open the visor of a suspiciously effeminate soldier For the love of God Marian Undeterred Marian flings herself on the bald Frenchman who murdered Von Sydow and then (just like a girl) tumbles into the surf and requires rescue. This allows Crowe to emit the slow-motion cry of rage NooooOOOOOOHHHHH Before the bad guy can finish off Marian he charges knocks the blackguard over appears to get caught between two boats (its hard to follow the action) then sees his foe fleeing on horseback NooooOOOOOOHHHHH A moment later he carries the stunned Marian up the beach in his arms neglecting to remove her layers of armor and chain mail beforehand. Its fun to think of what happened after that the pain in Crowes groin his realization that he has just given himself an inguinal hernia and his cry when Scott yells Cut NooooOOOOOOHHHHH Its too bad Robert Eisenberg used the name Boychiks in the Hood for his excellent book about Hasidic life because Kevin Aschs Holy Rollersinspired by the story of Hasidic Jews recruited in the nineties to serve as mules for bringing Ecstasy into the countrycould use a snazzier title. It could use more sex and violence too although theres only so much you can do with a story that ends not with carnage but some jail time and brokenhearted bubbes. The congenitally high-strung Jesse Eisenberg plays 20-year-old Brooklyn black-hat Sam Gold whos starting to chafe under Orthodoxys restrictions especially when the family of the girl he wants to marry nixes him in favor of someone more scholarly. (On their one and only datesitting on opposite sides of the sofashe says she wants eight kids. And the poor sap is still torn up about losing her) Sam is easy pickings for his neighbor Yosef (Justin Bartha) whos like a Hasidic Honest John in Pinocchio Hey pssst kid yeah you with the payis  Yosef is great because he says fuck a lot and talks about sex. And by and by Sam discovers hes pretty good at managing Hasidic couriers and likes being fondled by a badass Israeli drug dealers dyed-blonde Jewish moll (Ari Graynor).

Comments click to enlarge Robin Hood Video Rated PG-13  140 minutes  2010 I seem to recall Robin Hood stealing from the rich and giving to the poor but there isnt much of that in this 237 million action-adventure flick. Instead director Ridley Scott (salary 3.8 million) and screenwriter Brian Helgeland (3.5 million) focus on Robins efforts to unite his countrymen against the invading French and in favor of the Magna Carta. Russell Crowe (20 million) and Cate Blanchett (10 million) have some pleasant romantic wrangling as Robin and Maid Marion; the supporting players range from enjoyable (William Hurt Max von Sydow) to risible (Danny Huston as King Richard the Lionheart). But as in so many summer behemoths the real stars are the projectiles--in this case arrows with their own point-of-view shots zipping through the air and finding their targets with pinpoint accuracy.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 13 2010 309AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Robin Hood Directed by Ridley Scott Written by Brian Helgeland Starring Russell Crowe Cate Blanchett Oscar Isaac Classification PG Correct me if Im wrong but isnt it ""Robin Hood and his band of merry men""? Sure given the vast number of Robins who have graced the silver screen through its bronze history the guy is malleable a legend for all seasons and reasons. But always beneath the cutesy lesson in social democracy and the chivalrous romance with milk-skinned Marions and the delicious sight (to some) of men in tights the lads along with the viewers were there to have a rollicking good time. The arrows were straight but the tale was designed to bend towards kick-ass fun. Until now. Damned if those dual spoilsports the gladiatorial director Ridley Scott reteamed with his portly star Russell Crowe havent drained every drop of merriment right out of the myth. Instead theyve both come down with an acute case of epic-itis. What a ponderous leaden grey lump of a flick this is - over two hours of Block-Bluster. Gone is the outlaw prankster in his Sherwood-green Eden leading guerrilla raids on the greed of the ever-scheming Court. Replacing him in what purports to be a prequel to the legend is an earlier Mr. Hood (although in Crowes middle-aged hands certainly not younger). Alas this version turns out to be an altogether dour and humourless titan long on brawn but sadly short on quip. He seems more Roman than Robin or if you prefer a sporting metaphor think George Foreman before his personality change. We first spot him as a lowly archer in the army of the lion-hearted Richard storming a French castle while flaming pointed things shoot up and cascade down. Thats also our first glimpse of Scott in action mode and it aint promising - lots of close-up fire but no real heat. Anyway Robins ascent out of anonymity proves impressively fast. Right quick hes clambered up on a pulpit to deliver the first of his several sermons lecturing none other than King Richard himself on crusaders etiquette suggesting that the wanton slaughter of innocent Muslims might have been a tad excessive. (I think thats meant to pass for contemporary relevance.) From there the King is dead long live the King Enter the newly crowned John (Oscar Isaac) a demi-villain here given to cruelly taxing his people and bedding down with his Parisian mistress. The true baddie though is Godfrey the Bald (a chrome-domed Mark Strong) who unlike his monarch doesnt just frolic with the French but goes a treasonous step further - he actually speaks the lingo and fluently at that. Quelle shameful Brit. Meanwhile having sailed his way back to England Robin collects his band of ... sorry no that would imply a hint of the old merry and this is a merriment-free zone. I do believe the boys - Friar Will Allan Little John - make a fleeting appearance but not so youd notice and not just because Scott insists on shooting this glumness through a glass darkly. Slightly more prominent is Marion demoted from a maid to a widow in this incarnation and in keeping with the spirit of the occasion played by Cate Blanchett with a perpetual scowl. Understandably so - that body armour she dons in the name of steely feminism must be awfully uncomfortable. Ditto for the dagger she permanently packs beneath her bodice. Just guessing but that may explain the complete lack of sexual chemistry between her and Robin - or perhaps its just that a dose of steamy sex would run the risk of infecting the movie with some dastardly fun. Admittedly at one point Marion does remove Robins suit of chain mail link by lascivious link but it only proves that with his chest bared Crowes corpus is as lumpy as this opus. No matter. Robin is way too busy mounting more pulpits to deliver more sermons. In a fact hitherto unknown to history it seems his late Daddy Robin Sr. actually wrote a first draft of the Magna Carta thus freeing Junior to lecture the King on the fallibility of Divine Right and the necessity of ""liberty by law"". Thats one enlightened archer. Lecture over Scott charges on to the shores of the Channel and the climactic battle with the invading French. There for a brief shining moment he displays a majestic and panoramic flash of style. But the moment passes and were back to flaming pointed things. Of course this being a prequel the final frame is really the starting gun complete with our only prolonged look at Sherwoods leafy forest and a concluding title card that reads ""And so the legend begins"". About bloody time. Finally after hours of punishment the promise of fun - our God-given right at last.

Its a resolutely grim and grubby lesson in 13th-century British history filtered through all the requisite trademarks of a summer blockbuster.If that sounds like a drag thats because the movie pretty much is one. The title of director Ridley Scotts movie (originally slated to be called Nottingham) all but constitutes false advertising. Unlike the four previous films using that title to popularize the legend this movie is a prequel. Theres no robbing from the rich to give to the poor; you barely see the sheriff of Nottingham who in this version is less an archnemesis and more an irksome bureaucrat; and Robin doesnt hightail it to Sherwood Forest until the final moments of the movie.Instead what Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland present is that hot Hollywood commodity the prequel. They were plainly thinking of a Batman Begins-styled affair that would reboot the Robin Hood franchise right down to the films final pronouncement ""And so the legend begins."" But with Russell Crowe delivering yet another everyman-hero performance what this movie really feels like is a sequel - Gladiator 2 The Revenge of Maximus.The setting costumes and details may differ but the story remains altogether the same. Crowe glowers and grumbles as the disillusioned warrior turned by the evil scheming of lesser men against the crown he once valiantly served. Oscar Isaacs Prince John stands in for Joaquin Phoenixs Commodus playing the part of the cruel vainglorious upstart with none of Phoenixs wit or style. And where once was Richard Harris now is Max von Sydow as this movies enfeebled but proud father figure. Movie Information Robin HoodRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Ridley ScottStarring Russell Crowe Cate Blanchett Max von Sydow William Hurt Mark Strong and Oscar IsaacRun time 141 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (violence adult and sexual situations)Synopsis Russell Crowe strings the bow.More movies from GuideLive.comThere is the easy camaraderie Crowe shares with the small group of soldiers that presumably in the sequel will become his band of merry men. Theres the overarching theme of fighting against power-mad tyrants on behalf of the everyday dreams of ordinary folk. Theres Crowes tender core beneath that macho armor revealed in yet another soft-n-fuzzy endless love. This time his wife (an out-of-place Cate Blanchett) isnt dead; shes just not quite his wife. Theres even a repeat of that iconic poster shot from Gladiator when in the midst of battle one of Crowes men tosses him a sword as he thunders by on horseback. This time around its a big hammer instead of a sword but still.The only parts of Robin Hood that rise above the Magna Carta-for-dummies history lesson are the battle scenes. Ridley Scott knows how to stage and photograph combat and the castle sieges and field battles are impressive but even here there are frustrations. One is the odd and ultimately dishonest lack of bloodshed amid all this butchery. Arrows and swords and catapults and boiling oil and clubs and spear and more and yet the most blood you see is when Prince John cuts his thumb opening an oyster. Plainly this was done to maintain the films PG-13 rating but its a deceit for a movie in which not one but two guys get arrows shot through their throats.The other is the final battle with the French landing on the beaches beneath the Dover cliffs. The waves the boats the chaos the machine-gun-like fire of arrows the men drowning in water just a few feet from land - its Ridley Scott going all medieval on Saving Private Ryan.And finally its the worst thing a movie trying to be serious can be just plain silly. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Star Russell Crowe reunites with director Ridley Scott for what trailers are calling the ""untold story"" of the 13th-century hero who led an uprising against the king of England. Starring Russell Crowe Cate Blanchett William Hurt Mark Strong Mark Addy Oscar Isaac Danny Huston Eileen Atkins Max von Sydow Director Ridley Scott Release Opened May 14 2010  Editorial Review Nothing much to Crowe aboutBy Michael OSullivanFriday May 14 2010Dark and polemic Ridley Scotts ""Robin Hood"" is less about a band of merry men than a whole country of really angry ones. At times it feels like a political attack ad paid for by the tea party movement circa 1199. Set in an England that has been bankrupted by years of war in the Middle East -- in this case the Crusades -- its the story of a people who are being taxed to death by a corrupt government under an upstart ruler whos running the country into the ground. It asks Whats a man of principle to do?If you said ""Steal from the rich and give to the poor"" you must be thinking of the old Robin Hood. The correct answer here is ""Dont retreat reload."" There are more arrows flying every which way than youve ever seen -- through the face the neck the chest the back. Its a pincushion of a movie.There is however precious little of the socialist stuff that we normally associate with the man in tights in this new politicized version which ends precisely where most tellings of the legend begin with Robin Hood being declared an outlaw and moving to a camp in the woods with Maid Marion Little John Friar Tuck and the rest of them. In other words its a prequel to the movie that many of us remember. Except for the last five minutes ""Robin Hood"" is the story of the radicalization of some guy named Longstride.Who?Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) is a common bowman -- call him Joe the Archer -- in the army of King Richard the Lionheart. Danny Huston who plays Richard seems to have taken the name a little too literally wearing a wig reminiscent of the Cowardly Lions hair in ""The Wizard of Oz.""On the way back from the Crusades Richard is killed whereupon Robin ends up carrying Richards crown back to England and into the hands of Richards brother the treacherous unseasoned Prince John (Oscar Isaac).But Robins also on a second delivery run having agreed to return a sword belonging to a slain nobleman Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge) to Loxleys family in Nottingham. In order to avoid accusations of theft Robin temporarily assumes Loxleys identity.When our hero rides up to the Loxley estate however hes not only asked to stay by Roberts father Walter (Max von Sydow) but -- as improbable as it sounds -- to continue the impersonation living as husband and wife with Roberts hot widow Marion (Cate Blanchett). Without a man see Marion would lose the land when Walter dies.Its here as lord of the manor that Robins re-education begins. But not as in every other ""Robin Hood"" at the hands of the sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfadyen) whos relegated to benchwarmer status here. The real bad guy of the picture is Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong) the newly crowned King Johns chief tax enforcer. While pillaging village after village hes secretly working as a spy for the French who hope to take advantage of the civil unrest hes sowing by invading England.Yeah its complicated. And the numerous on-screen titles which identify the ever-shifting locations -- Barnsdale one minute Berkhamsted Castle the next -- dont really help. Theres so much backroom palace intrigue going on that the movie can start to sound like an episode of ""The Sopranos"" after a while. ""He knows too much"" says Godfrey at one point. ""Get rid of him."" Gruesomely disfigured by one of Robins arrows and clad all in black he looms as large as Darth Vader.But Mafia and ""Star Wars"" overtones arent the only odd ingredients in ""Robin Hood"" which was written by Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential""). Godfreys Gestapo tactics are straight out of a Holocaust movie. And the films climactic battle -- set on a beach beset by a fleet of French troops against whom Robin has rallied the English people -- is weirdly reminiscent of the D-Day scene in ""Saving Private Ryan.""So wheres the room for Robin Hood -- the derring-do the dash -- amid all this clutter? Unfortunately there isnt much. Crowe makes an especially dour Robin. The actor looks grim puffy and haggard throughout except for one brief scene in which he strips out of his chain mail -- with the help of Marion -- for a long-overdue bath revealing a buff if battle-scarred physique. He just doesnt seem to be having that much fun.Not that the movie is completely without it. Mark Addy makes for a jolly dipsomaniacal Friar Tuck; Kevin Durand a goofy and lumbering Little John. And Blanchetts Marion who takes up arms alongside the best of the men is a feisty feminist treat.But the Robin Hood of myth and moviedom is for the most part AWOL. Why should we have to wait until the last five minutes to see Crowe crack a smile let alone split an arrow? The films closing title screen -- which reads ""And so the legend begins"" -- suggests that if you want to see that movie you may have to wait for ""Robin Hood II.""Contains plentiful violence sensuality and some sexual humor.

Starring Russell Crowe Cate Blanchett and Mark Strong. Directed by Ridley Scott. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Russell Crowe is a different kind of Robin Hood and Ridleys Scotts ""Robin Hood"" is a very different distillation of the old legend. Crowe isnt merry. Hes not impish and he has no green suit. He doesnt put his hands on his waist and throw back his head laughing and he doesnt even steal from the rich to give to the poor. Rather he fights against the rich to protect the rights of the upper middle class. And the battles are ugly - arrows through the neck spears through the chest very medieval. What Crowe brings to the role is the natural aura of a leader as well as the decent-guy integrity of a man who means what he says. One of Crowes best moments comes early. King Richard the Lionheart who is so morally compromised that hes played by Danny Huston asks for Robins honest opinion of his Holy Land Crusade. Ruefully quietly and steadily Robin/Crowe tells a shameful story of mass slaughter and the moral weight of the atrocity lands on everyone onscreen and in the audience. Through such moments Scotts approach to the legend becomes persuasive. Instead of the usual romantic adventure Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland offer a gritty drama using the Robin Hood story to depict the birth pangs of liberty. They ground the film in the details of medieval life. We see how wars were fought - the various strategies and weaponry - and how news traveled. We see the attempts at pomp and splendor the church bells and trumpets greeting the arrival of the king. Mainly we see harshness and ugliness. The common people are stupid and the wealthy are evil schemers and even the good guys smell to high heaven. In this scheme Crowe becomes essential He is utterly believable as the unconscious standard-bearer of the future the select man through whom humanity might make some small desperately needed advance. He starts off as a common archer returning from King Richards disastrous last crusade. Richard is no hero. He and his men are raping the countryside sacking every castle and estate on their way back to England. Robin and a group of friends escape Richards ranks but they soon find themselves drawn into the center of a series of intrigues involving the future of England. In most Robin Hood movies the political situation is drawn in such a way that its easy to know when to hiss and when to cheer. But in ""Robin Hood"" the politics are intentionally muddled. In a struggle between the vindictive mincing Prince John (Oscar Isaac) and the French invaders there really is no one to root for as neither represents the peoples interests. This is a sophisticated approach to the material but it presents some narrative challenges too and the movie slows down and starts to sag about two-thirds in. It recovers. Scott has great command of his action sequences. His cutting and camera movements are vigorous but not haphazard and the hand-to-hand combat is processed in such a way that everything metallic (swords belt buckles etc.) looks electric. More significantly we never lose the overall picture. One battle looks like a 13th century version of the Normandy invasion with just a touch of the Bay of Pigs. If the movie lacks something its on the emotional side of things. A dour Robin could have used a lively Maid Marion to give him something to fight for but the relationship between Marion (Cate Blanchett) and Robin is lukewarm as though theyre saving the fireworks for a sequel that may never happen. This is the downside to Scotts decidedly unromantic take on the legend. He removed the adventure aspect and some of the movies passion was lost too like a dolphin caught in a tuna net. Perhaps its for that reason that a movie that starts out with the potential to be great somehow falls short and what seems as if its going to be a revelation ends up instead simply a worthwhile reasonably interesting variation on an old theme. -- Advisory Lots of violence and bad teeth.

The fuss about how it boldly reinvents a beloved tale winds up as truthful as those laundry-detergent claims heralding a ""new"" and ""improved"" product. Theres no whiff of genuine freshness here.

Not a bad thing if executed well and the masterful Scott (""Alien"" ""Gladiator"") at the helm keeps the pace fast helping gloss over imperfections.This mead-brained prequel to the more familiar version hits its target in the early action scenes and whenever the sharp strong Maid Marion (a luminous Cate Blanchett) and the deliciously duplicitous Godfrey (scene-stealer Mark Strong of ""Kick-Ass"") are on screen. Sadly Russell Crowe in the title role is too restrained and too bland as Robin although he does have the presence and swoon-worthy appeal even when he dons a purple paisley shirt and slick leather pants to show off his soft side. Sorry but there are no tights to be found.Advertisement Everyone no matter how good is ultimately undone by a chaotic screenplay that erratically shifts tones and cribs from other films. Storytelling deja vu rules throughout this ""Robin Hood"" with scenes that seem to have played out on ""The Sopranos"" ""Braveheart"" and in of the most undeveloped plot threads ""Peter Pan"" with the lost boys of Sherwood Forest ransacking Nottingham. (That bit kicks off the film an odd choice given the kids never get much screen time afterward.) The story finds Robin assuming the identity of Maid Marions dead husband while France plots to conquer England and its newly crowned king. The films ultimate Achilles heel (it even emulates Brad Pitts ""Troy"" in a lackluster and laughable climax) is Oscar winner Brian Helgelands script. The ""L.A. Confidential"" scribe doesnt quite know what hes going after so he chases after everything -- romance action politics and history. Luckily the keen-eyed Scott immerses us in the rich historical details of unmerry England as well as the verdant scenery but even he becomes hogtied by Helgeland who annoyingly tosses in contemporary dialogue and allusions that simply fizzle. And while the plot about kings and noblemen socking it to the middle class and poor with higher taxes resonates today -- for tea party loyalists this ""Robin Hood"" could become a rallying point like ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was for Iraq war protesters -- the screenplay never really knows what it wants to say about it. It flits around issues and never hammers home an original point. Instead we get the same old lesson about standing up to injustices. Not what I would call a ""new"" and ""improved"" message.To compensate Helgeland jumps around a lot from a castle battle in France (rousingly directed by Scott) to the bedroom of the spoiled brat Prince John (newcomer Oscar Isaac) who eventually wears the crown after his brother King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston in Cowardly Lion locks) is killed in battle.In the pantheon of Robin Hood films this is a passable and suitable version. It is leagues better than the 1991 Kevin Costner fiasco and thankfully devoid of a Bryan Adams song. But thats not good enough given the talent in front of and behind the camera. ""Robin Hood"" 2010 should have hit the summer blockbuster bulls-eye full on.

"Ridley Scotts Robin Hood reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Ridley Scotts Robin Hood reviewed. Ridley Scotts Robin Hood reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 13 2010 723 PM Ridley Scotts Robin Hood Not as terrible as it could have been. By Dana Stevens Robin Hood Im not exactly sure on what grounds I plan to stand up for Ridley Scotts Robin Hood (Universal Pictures). Nowhere near as terrible as it could have been? Reasonably successful given the grievous miscasting at its core? Lets go with pretty much ill-conceived from the ground up but saved by a couple of strong performances and a wealth of well-researched period detail. Not the most elegant defense but like the movie itll do. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The legend of the forest-dwelling thief and his merry band has been committed to film scores of times most definitively in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) one of those magical movies in which everything--the casting of then-newcomer Errol Flynn the crisp vividness of early Technicolor the jaunty score by Erich Korngold--somehow coalesced into a perfect artifact. Seventy-two years later the Errol Flynn Robin Hood is still the version to beat and its shadow--or rather its lack of shadow for never has a movie been sunnier--looms over any cinematic return to Sherwood Forest. Scotts remake is unremittingly dour in the modern style Thats how we reboot old legends right? By making sure no one in them smiles? Advertisement The movies long windup has Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) returning from the Crusades where he fought in the service of King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston). When Richard is killed while laying siege to a French castle (in a gory and hyper-realistic battle scene that illustrates the barbarism of medieval warfare) Robin and a few of his men desert the army and flee for England. On the way back he stops off at an estate near Nottingham Castle to return the sword of a slain knight Sir Robert Loxley. There Robin learns that the dead knights father Walter (Max von Sydow) and widow Marion (Cate Blanchett) are about to have their land seized by the greedy Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew McFadyen.) So Robin agrees to pass himself off as the returned Loxley to save the estate. The fiercely independent Lady Marion is furious at this plan and forces the newcomer to sleep on the floor of her bedchamber with no blanket and only a log for a pillow. Meanwhile Richard the Lionhearts brother the treacherous King John (Oscar Isaac) assumes the throne and immediately begins scheming with his adviser Godfrey (Mark Strong) to collude with the invading French army in breaking the backs of the English populace with exorbitant taxes. Theres a lot of throne-room intrigue much of which hews fairly closely to the actual facts of political turmoil of 13th-century England. But the movie has to perform some convoluted narrative footwork to connect the Robin Hood story to these larger historical events. In one far-fetched scene Robin presents the king with a scroll of populist demands that reads like a first draft of the Magna Carta. The screenwriter Brian Helgeland seems to be working from a memo forbidding the use of any recognizable tropes from the Robin Hood legend. Not a soul wears green (even though theres some literary and historical precedent for associating the color with the region where the story takes place). Little John (Kevin Durand) isnt particularly large Friar John (Mark Addy) never carries Robin Hood on his back across a river and no one mounts a horse by leaping down onto its back from a tree. Nor until the movies last few minutes is there any of the charitably motivated highway robbery that was the Merry Mens stock in trade. This adaptation seems either not to understand the appeal of its source material or to reject it deliberately. The movie eschews every value weve come to think of as quintessentially Robin Hood-ish derring-do mischief laughter joy. Scott has used Crowes stocky build and brooding intense manner effectively in the past; in Gladiator American Gangster Body of Lies and other films the actors stolid and glowering presence worked on his behalf. But what on earth made anyone think Crowe would make a good Robin Hood? Off the top of my head I could think of a dozen actors currently working whod be better-suited for the role. But even if Crowe makes no sense as the outlaw-trickster of Sherwood Forest hes always an interesting actor to watch (unlike for example Kevin Costner whose 1991 Robin Hood was simply dull) and hes surrounded here by an exceptional supporting cast. Max von Sydow is luminous as the aged but unbowed Sir Walter. Cate Blanchett brings her usual dedication and attention to detail to the humdrum task of playing Lady Marion; shes like a master carpenter asked to craft an Ikea desk. Mark Strong whos become the go-to Hollywood heavy (he played a suave Jordanian spy in Body of Lies an occult con artist in Sherlock Holmes and a sociopathic mob boss in Kick-Ass) schemes with aplomb. Advertisement As the movie ends weve reached the beginning of the Robin Hood legend as we know it with Robin and Marion setting up a theft-based commune in the woods a bounty having been placed on their heads by the Sheriff of Nottingham. Theres something galling about the confidence with which Scott assumes we were all dying for a 140-minute prequel to a new Robin Hood franchise. But if the principal role were recast in the next installment with an actor with a little sprezzatura--Robert Downey Jr.? Johnny Depp? Brad Pitt?--Id be willing to make the pilgrimage back to Sherwood. Slate V The Critics on Robin Hood Letters to Juliet and Just Wright Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

CANNES -- Forget Sherwood Forest and green tights. Banish any thoughts of those Merry Men. And please dont go expecting anything remotely like that lighthearted 1938 classic with Errol Flynn. If youre able to make this leap of faith its possible to have a rousing good time at Ridley Scotts smart revisionist and typically dark ""Robin Hood"" which wisely (I think) goes out of its way to avoid comparisons to earlier films inspired by the English legend. ""Robin Hood"" which opened this years Cannes Film Festival Tuesday night is effectively a prequel to Robins better-known adventures featuring a splendid Russell Crowe as the most mature Robin since Sean Connery in Richard Lesters 1976 feature ""Robin and Marian."" Like that earlier film set 20 years after the main legend the new film opens with King Richard the Lionheart (in this case Danny Huston) taking a fatal arrow to the neck in France while on the way back from the Crusades in 1199. Crowe is in fighting form as Robin Longstride in this version a commoner obliged to take the place of fallen fellow Crusader Sir Robert Loxley and return the crown to London. The dying man has also tasked Robin with returning his fathers sword to Nottingham -- where Loxleys aged dad (Max von Sydow) insists he continue the impersonation. This does not initially please the late knights strong-willed wife Marian who in the splendid form of Cate Blanchett is no maiden -- and knows how to handle a sword as well as a plow. Nottingham is in a dire state overtaxed by King John (Oscar Isaac) Richards ineffectual and greedy successor who dismisses his brothers wise chancellor (William Hurt) in favor of the sadistic Godfrey (Mark Strong) whos secretly in league with King Philip of France. Robins main mission is pulling together an England on the verge of civil war to fight a French invasion -- leading to a thrilling climax the best thing Scott has done since ""Gladiator."" The main flaw of this fast-moving nearly 21/2-hour movie is its relatively uninteresting main villain -- Strong whose glowering one-note performance doesnt vary all that much from the one he gave in ""Sherlock Holmes."" Crowe easily blows away Hollywoods last major Robin Hood the spectacularly miscast Kevin Costner. Hes entirely credible as a weary soldier returning from a decade in the Crusades who becomes a reluctant hero delivering a well-written speech about the rights of man. Crowe also has substantial romantic chemistry with Blanchett who even joins him in battle. Im not sure American audiences will sufficiently embrace this gritty version to allow for the sequel promised in the final scene. On its own terms though ""Robin Hood"" is head and shoulders above the sort of lightheaded epics Hollywood typically offers during the summer season. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Burns updates his popular Baseball documentary Read Next Burns updates his popular Baseball documentary Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44527 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21107 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 17704 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Robin Hood | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; robin-hood ) Robin Hood (United States/United Kingdom 2010) May 13 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The tale of Robin Hood is one of several dozen Hollywood staples that experiences re-makes or re-interpretations on a regular basis by the motion picture industry. If nothing else thats a testimony to the legends enduring popularity. The most recent big-budget take Kevin Reynolds critically-panned blockbuster Robin Hood Prince of Thieves (starring a woefully miscast Kevin Costner) arrived in theaters 19 summers ago so one could argue its time to provide the current generation with their own version. Although the material may like many stories that have become overly familiar through repetition be more inclined to provoke a yawn than a surge of excitement the participation of director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe at least inspires intrigue. Can their involvement re-invigorate the narrative and make this Robin Hood more than an unnecessary placeholder between Iron Man 2 and Shrek Forever After? Sadly its difficult to answer that in the affirmative. Scotts Robin Hood is a cobbling together of various elements from the many myths and legends about the revered outlaw. By cherry-picking fact and fiction (considerably more of the latter than the former) Scott crafts a different milieu than what one typically associates with the hero of Sherwood Forest. Unfortunately the result is more like the warmed-up leftovers of Braveheart than a new approach to an old tale. There are numerous reasons why the film doesnt work as effectively as it might but the principal two likely have more to do with the financial realities of modern-day filmmaking than with inherent flaws in the material. The PG-13 rating (mandatory for maximizing audience size) disallows any serious bloodletting or sexuality and this makes much of Robin Hood seem almost cartoonish. The 140-minute running length although long for a ""normal"" motion picture is skinny for a would-be epic and was likely achieved only after significant edits to the original cut. The result is choppy and theres a sense that a lot - perhaps too much - resides on the cutting room floor. One has to wonder whether Scotts original vision of Robin Hood was more adult and fully-formed than the theatrical version. (Kingdom of Heaven provided a perfect opportunity to compare the directors intended cut with the studio-mandated trim.) Robin Hood functions as a prequel of sorts to the more common Robin Hood movies making it the cinematic equivalent of a superhero origin story. The movie starts with Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) as one of the most accurate and honest archers in the army of King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston). When the king is killed while assaulting a French castle Robin and his cohorts obtain the crown and return it to London so the next ruler Prince John (Oscar Isaac) can wear it. John proves to be a less able ruler than his brother. His chief goal is generating revenue so he appoints the French double-agent Godfrey (Mark Strong) as his primary tax collector. Since Godfrey is actually working for the King of France he is more interested in fomenting civil unrest than filling Johns coffers so he acts in ruthless unprincipled ways. He and Robin become enemies and Godfreys strike against Nottingham where Robin has established an identity as the son of Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) and the wife of Marion Loxley (Cate Blanchett) is fueled primarily by revenge rather than as a means to improve the odds of a successful French invasion of England. Most of the recognizable characters of Robin Hood lore are present. In addition to Robin and ""Maid"" Marion we meet Friar Tuck (Mark Addy) a bee-keeping priest who cares more about equality on Earth than being rewarded in the afterlife; Robins companions-in-arms from King Richards Crusade Little John (Kevin Durand) and Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes); and various other ""Merry Men."" The traditional Robin Hood villain the Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfadyen) is present but his role is small and hes presented as silly and ineffectual. The real bad guy in this movie is Godfrey and we know hes rotten to the core because hes being played by Mark Strong who has recently donned a black hat in as such diverse offerings as The Young Victoria Sherlock Holmes and Kick-Ass. If thats not typecasting Im unsure what is. Russell Crowes version of Robin Hood never once reminded me of the character by that name. Crowes portrayal is more that of a contemporary generic brooding action hero marooned 800 years before his time. His inspirational speeches are especially out of character especially when one considers that the film would have viewers believe Robin was the force behind Magna Carta. If you didnt know he was supposed to be Robin Hood youd never guess. Cate Blanchett turns Marion into an equal-rights firebrand (Im sure there were many of these around in 1200) even going so far as to don armor and participate in the climactic battle. The biggest oddity is Matthew Macfadyens Sheriff who would be more at home in a Shrek movie than this one. He could play with Donkey. Everything in Robin Hood builds to a lavish battle pitting the undermanned English against the superior force of invading French. The sequence is so obviously cribbed from Braveheart that no attempt is made to hide the fact. The impact however is considerably less. The conflict is more tepid than rousing and the ending feels obligatory perhaps because anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of the Robin Hood legend knows where this is going. Thats one of the problems with prequels in general theyre all about getting to an established point in the mythos and often fail to excite as a result. There is some entertainment value to be found in Robin Hood but my sincerest hope is that theres a better version out there awaiting a DVD release. (The ""secret"" involving Robins parentage desperately needs to be fleshed out - its half-puzzling and half-laughable as presented here.) If this truly is Ridley Scotts preferred cut he has proven unable to justify the existence of yet another Robin Hood film.

Up to now the only absurd retelling of the evergreen legend has been Mel Brookss send-up ""Robin Hood Men in Tights."" Yet Ridley Scotts new version achieves an absurdity all its own. Its an ersatz epic about men in fights--grim fights grinding battles clanking combats that are repetitive and in a movie that runs 140 minutes all but endless. Russell Crowe fights against Brian Helgelands turgid script--although as the star and one of the producers he must have been complicit in its development. Still hes thwarted by the productions almost total and truly absurd absence of fun. Watch a scene from ""Robin Hood"" directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe. Video courtesy of Universal. ""The more the merrier"" Robin says at one point. If only. The sole merriment outbreak occurs perversely at the very end when all battles have ceased and Robin and his men are regrouping in the forest. Until then this phenomenally monotonous ""Robin Hood"" dwells on Robins beginnings as a commoner who impersonates a knight takes up arms against ruthless King John and his treacherous henchman unifies Albion against a French invasion and as if that werent enough is mainly responsible for drawing up the Magna Carta. (Except that the king refuses to sign the darned thing so where does that leave England now?) Robins romance with Cate Blanchetts Marion doesnt strike many sparks even though their early scenes promise a comical taming of the shrew. (Marion is outraged that her father whos played by Max von Sydow urges Robin to pass himself off as her late husband so that she can retain title to her land.) They exchange meaningful glances and dance a slow dance thats mildly sexy in an abstract way but generate little heat. ENLARGE Russell Crowe plays the title role in Robin Hood. Universal Studios There can be no other Robin Hood than Errol Flynn. All others no matter how good the production values of the film can only be considered pretenders. --Derek Crane Comedy and romance arent what the directors reputation has been built on of course. A Ridley Scott film promises spectacle laced by character thats grounded in action. While ""Gladiator"" didnt delve into the psyche of Mr. Crowes incorruptible Maximus one still sensed the man of the soil he once was and the lover he used to be. This Robin Hood by contrast comes equipped with a special heritage--his father may have worked as a lowly mason but he was also a visionary and a philosopher. Instead of deepening Robins character though such info only creates the impression of a hero grounded in psychobabble. And Mr. Crowe comes off as slightly ridiculous in a climactic show of heroism that may have been meant as a cheerful nod to Maximus yet misfires all the same. ""Robin Hood"" does look fairly spectacular from time to time--an incendiary attack on a French chateau a royal flotilla sailing serenely up the Thames. But most of the martial clashes are interchangeable the digital effects sometimes ring false (the French armada floating on Channel waves that could be crinkled cellophane) and the big set pieces are stylistically scattered (the armadas barges modeled on American landing craft at Omaha Beach the climactic battle beneath the cliffs of Dover evoking by turns ""Saving Private Ryan"" ""Henry V"" ""Chimes at Midnight"" and even in a clumsily staged squeezing together of two ships the trash compactor scene in ""Star Wars."") The cast includes Oscar Isaac William Hurt Eileen Atkins and Mark Strong whose villainy as the vile Godfrey outstrips Robins righteousness. Watch a scene from ""Letters to Juliet"" a new Verona-set romance starring Amanda Seyfried. Video courtesy of Summit Entertainment. Letters To Juliet The starting point of ""Letters to Juliet"" is fact that feels like fiction. The result is fiction that could pass for a squishy Harlequin romance at every turn were it not for the presence of Vanessa Redgrave. Like a civic Dear Abby serving the lovelorn of the world the northern Italian city of Verona which was the setting for Shakespeares play actually receives a ceaseless stream of letters addressed to Juliet and every letter is answered by volunteer members of Veronas Juliet Club. Amanda Seyfrieds Sophie a New Yorker magazine fact checker who wants to become a writer joins the club as an ad hoc member during a vacation in Verona with her husband-to-be Victor an ambitious young chef played by Gael Garcia Bernal. Soon Sophie outdoes her fellow volunteers. She uncovers a letter written 50 years ago by an ardent English girl named Claire then sets about to reunite Claire now a septuagenarian played by Ms. Redgrave with the love she had long ago found in Verona and lost. ENLARGE Vanessa Redgrave left and Amanda Seyfried in Letters to Juliet. Summit Entertainment Never mind the preposterous plot mechanics the cloying script (by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan) Victors insufferability (its a terrible performance by an excellent actor) Ms. Seyfrieds limitations (her skill is still no match for her beauty) or the limited charisma of Claires handsome grandson whos played by Christopher Egan. Ms. Redgrave gives the film which was directed by Gary Winick a heart and a buoyant spirit. Seeing her in action is like sitting in on a master acting class. Her lines are trite? No matter. She transforms them with longing that can make you weep with fugitive glances of witty horror with an avidity for life that Claire seems to regain while we watch. (It doesnt hurt that Ms. Redgrave gets to play opposite Franco Nero who was once the love of her life and is the father of her son.) Not even she can transform lines like ""Destiny wanted us to meet again."" But then she says ""When were talking about love its never too late"" and theres no way to disbelieve her. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com ENLARGE Twentieth Century Fox Blu-ray Discs Colorful World If you think Blu-ray discs are just another way to separate consumers from their hard-earned cash youve got another think--and a closer look--coming. This relatively new high-definition format delivers brilliantly on its promise. In a stream of Blu-ray titles that will soon become a torrent the standout so far is ""Avatar"" which was released last month in a two-disc combo package that includes a standard-def DVD. Be forewarned that this is the movie--in 2-D--and nothing more; subsequent packages will offer special features additional footage and before too long 3-D. Be enticed however by the astonishing quality of the images and the sound. On a good hi-def display this disc makes the concept of home theater truly theatrical. The absence of 3-D is a loss especially in lyrical interludes with those enchanting phosphorescent floaters and aerial jellyfish but not so much of a loss or none at all in action sequences that depend on movement and mass. When Pandoras giant Hometree falls its an in-home calamity. Here are four other titles that demonstrate what Blu-ray can do and deserve your attention in their own right. --Joe Morgenstern ENLARGE Home ""Home"" a documentary by Yann Arthus-Bertrand understates the case by billing itself as ""a stunning visual portrayal of Earth."" Its a portrayal unlike any other--aerial photography that studies the planet and its populations from altitudes high and low. The filmmaker has a penchant for abstract designs that Matisse might have found enthralling but the film narrated by Glenn Close has more on its mind than gorgeous pictures. Like ""Avatar"" its concerned with what were doing to our planetary environment. ""Home"" moves from eco-celebration through stern polemic to dire warning. ENLARGE Battleship Potemkin ""Battleship Potemkin"" triumphs once again in Kinos Blu-ray release of Sergei Eisensteins 1925 masterpiece restored through the efforts of cinema groups in Germany Russia and England. Why Blu-ray for an 85-year-old silent? Because the luminous images convey a sense of how revolutionary the film was cinematically as well as politically and the soundtrack does full justice to the original Edmund Meisel score performed here by the 55-piece Deutsches Filmorchestra. Contemporary filmmakers are still stealing--or honoring by recycling--elements of Eisensteins film. Heres a new chance to savor the source. ENLARGE WallE ""WallE"" hasnt been the subject of my ecstasizing for a while but thats not because I love Andrew Stantons animated masterpiece any less. Now theres more to love in the Blu-ray release which comes with a profusion of bonus features plus a digital edition for transfer to a computer or iPhone. The idea of watching ""WallE"" on a cellphone screen is akin to capturing the Grand Canyon with a cellphone camera but watching it in Blu-ray is a revelation. During the dance that WallE and Eva dance in space the cosmos came into my living room. ENLARGE Stop Making Sense ""Stop Making Sense"" makes another kind of sense as a Blu-ray release. It isnt that Jonathan Demmes Talking Heads concert film--one of the best concert films ever made by the way--looks significantly better than it does on a conventional DVD. Every format is limited by the quality of the source material and Jordan Cronenweths cinematography was admirable though not exceptional. But the concert sounds remarkably better because ""Stop Making Sense"" was in 1985 the first film to be recorded entirely in digital audio and Blu-ray discs have the storage capacity to precisely replicate studio masters. This disc is a feast for sore ears.

But its also well-written engaging and funny.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune May 13 2010 -- 540pm Universal Pictures Associated Press - Ap Russell Crowe iin ""Robin Hood."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Its difficult to do a ""Robin Hood"" movie without making it a cover version of an earlier story. After all weve been retelling this straight arrows tale for at least 500 years. Still the Russell Crowe/Ridley Scott edition is a more energetic and interesting entry than you might expect from this overpopulated genre. This lighthearted drama feels like its own show thanks to its strong character-driven screenplay. Scotts natural tone is brooding and sardonic and Crowe (squint scowl rumble glare) is not the lightest of actors. They need material that lifts their spirits and thats just what the story provides. Brian Helgeland the screenwriter of ""Mystic River"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" elevates this film above its genre by taking the time to develop its characters and scenario. Quite a bit of time ""Robin Hood"" runs a languorous sometimes-laggy 140 minutes. But patience has its rewards. Alongside impressive battle sequences we get likable heroes indelible villains and strong feisty female characters. Theres ribald humor without ""Men in Tights"" tomfoolery. Scotts films are usually high on technical polish but iffy in terms of emotional engagement. This one scores on all counts. The film focuses on Robins pre-outlaw days the formative period when he became an anti-authoritarian individualist. We meet him during the crusade of King Richard the Lionhearted (Danny Huston whose sense of entitlement and invulnerability only goes so far in battle). This is where the battle-weary archer acquired the particular set of skills and attitudes that make him a nightmare for the ruling class. Fed up with medieval massacres this modern-thinking maverick deserts carrying a sword from the fallen Robert of Locksley back to his father Walter (Max von Sydow) in Nottingham. The old nobleman asks Robin to impersonate the long-absent Robert in a scheme to thwart the rapacious tax collectors of newly elevated King John (Oscar Isaac a licentious young snot operating on an entirely different wavelength of royal arrogance from Hustons). Roberts strong-willed widow Lady Marian (Cate Blanchett) takes a while to warm up to this arrangement. Meanwhile the good people of Nottingham are harassed by the kings agents and England is under threat from France planning an invasion in reprisal for the late Richards pillaging. It looks like Robin wont be retiring his bow and quiver after all. ROBIN HOOD  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for violence including intense scenes of warfare and some sexual content. ""Robin Hood"" borrows action riffs from ""Braveheart"" ""Gladiator"" and the Normandy Beach battle in ""Saving Private Ryan"" but its primarily a smart layered revisionist legend. Theres a lot of well-written talk which suits Crowe. The heavyset actor is no Errol Flynn in the athletics department; his deep rumbling Britspeak is his strongest suit. He conveys the humanity under this warriors hard-case exterior. Helgeland finds contemporary political themes in the old story and he slyly covers all the bases. Theres a tone of populist anger in several scenes of ruinous taxation. Peaceniks will like Robins speech about King Richards ""godless"" slaughter of innocent Muslims. Blanchetts stalwart Marian is a 13th-century feminist. Amoral King John could have stepped straight from the microphones of a Senate Banking Committee hearing. Viewers of every stripe will find something to cheer about here. And when Crowe leads his uprising ""Robin Hood"" delivers change you can believe in.

This ""Robin Hood"" is an origins story a tale of how Robin and company came to be fabled outlaws.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted May 14 2010Tis not your jaunty swashbuckler this Robin Hood.Muddy bloody and full of elaborate reenactments of medieval warfare - the storming of castles the raining of arrows the rabble rebelling against greedhead royals - Ridley Scotts reimagining of the legend of Robin Hood has more heft than it does humor more soulful brooding than snappy thrust-and-parry retorts.But as unlike the Errol Flynn Adventures of Robin Hood as it is (and most other Hollywood iterations for that matter) this Robin Hood is not a bad thing. For one it stars Russell Crowe and so his Robin Longstride - a soldier in the army of King Richard plundering its way across Europe at the end of the Crusades - is as good at archery as he is at arching his brow.As he did with director Scott in Gladiator Crowe leavens his ferocity with a sideways wink his serious brutishness with a charmers smile in what is essentially an origins story - how Robin and His Merry Band came to be Sherwoods fabled outlaws.In one scene Crowe Cate Blanchett and Max von Sydow stand in the cavernous hearth room of a Nottingham castle. While the dialogue is thick with talk of bonds between fathers and sons of broken promises between kings and commoners all you can really think of is how cool is this the two Australians and the stentorian Swede alchemizing some actorly magic.Blanchett of course is Marion. Marion of Loxley wife to a knight whos off fighting with Richard. Shes left behind to watch as her horses and her harvests are plundered by a gang of renegade orphans in spooky masks. (The images of these nearly naked guerrilla fighters running wild through the woods have a primal pagan beauty about them.) Von Sydow is her blind and bowed old father-in-law Sir Walter.When Robin comes knocking at the castle door bearing the sword of Sir Robert Loxley - and bearing the news of his death in the Crusades - the father and the wife shudder with grief and then get on with a wily masquerade Robin will pretend to be Robert. He will share the ladys chamber (but not her bed) and call Sir Walter his dad in order to calm the troubled village folk and maintain what stability is left in the Loxley domain.Its a ruse that Marion first bristles at - you can see her ""I will sever your manhood"" caution in the Robin Hood trailer - but he being Robin (and Crowe) and she being a woman who has not seen a husband in many a year love between these two is not hard to imagine.As long as villainy doth not impede.And there is plenty of villainy. Tea partyers will like the whiff of protest this Robin Hood emits with its power elite (Oscar Isaac as the nervously imperious Prince John) demanding taxes more taxes and giving nothing in return. Mark Strong - the bad Lord Blackwood of Sherlock Holmes - is the evil double agent running between London and France orchestrating tyranny and betrayal. Eileen Atkins is the displeased Queen Mother LA(c)a Seydoux the French mistress of John William Hurt an appropriately theatrical royal counsel.Shot in glorious widescreen and said to have cost a bundle (155 million? 200 million? Whos counting?) Robin Hood boasts graphic battle scenes and ingenious intrigue a sense of history that may not be accurate but feels authentic and a love story that smartly plays with gender and Hollywood stereotypes.When was the last time you saw a seduction scene in which the man asks the woman to help him remove his clothes?Its chainmail in this case it weighs a ton and that clasp at the back of Crowes neck is impossible to get at without assistance.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The best part about origin stories at least where Hollywood is concerned is that you get to make stuff up. As long as you end with something along the lines of ""And thats how Captain Kirk met Mr. Spock youre free to invent characters and events to bring a rusty old franchise up to date with fresh dialogue attitude and effects.In the case of ""Robin Hood that final title card reads ""And so the legend begins and it comes after a massive seaside battle sequence that suggests director Ridley Scott is trying to remake ""Braveheart by way of ""Saving Private Ryan. (Did you know they had World War II-style landing transports in 12th-century England? Me neither.) As climaxes go its a serious misstep an epic muddle that forgets why we came here in the first place.Luckily the rest of the movie remembers. This ""Robin Hood is mostly a smart muscular entertainment; it doesnt breathe new life into a genre as did ""Gladiator Scotts first pairing with Russell Crowe but its a brawny reimagining of a beloved old myth a period popcorn movie turned out with professionalism and gusto. And in Crowe it has a Robin who may lack the light ness of Errol Flynn (still the greatest Hood of them all) but who possesses a presence and authority to make you forget all about Kevin Costner.That said this aint your grandmas Nottingham. For one thing there are those creepy feral children in rawhide masks skulking through Sherwood Forest orphans abandoned by a regime obsessed with conquest and money. Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) is returning home from 10 years at the Crusades -- pausing to pillage a castle or two just for the hell of it -- and Prince John (Oscar Isaac) a spoiled playboy with severe sibling-rivalry issues is barely holding down the throne. The King of France (Jonathan Zaccai) is plotting invasion the northern barons are in revolt the kings chancellor (William Hurt) is in despair and the aged Eleanor of Aquitaine (Eileen Atkins) only wishes she could give her son the prince a good spanking.Robin Longstride (Crowe) is first glimpsed as an archer in the kings service weary of war and holding a few seditious ideas about democracy in his big round head. As the army nears England disaster strikes and Robin lights out with a merrie entourage that includes hulking Little John (Kevin Durand) boisterous Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes) and Allen ADayle (Alan Doyle) who plays a mean lute. What little comedy ""Robin Hood has comes from these three and it needs all the help it can get.The chief villain is Godfrey a black-clad bald-headed attack dog of a noble whos played by Mark Strong (""Kick-Ass) with every ounce of Basil Rathbone he can summon up even if he looks more like Stanley Tuccis scary brother. Working for both Prince John and the French Godfrey chases Robin north to Nottingham where our hero finds himself forced to pretend hes the returned knight Robert of Loxley to keep the taxman from the door. Old Sir Walter Loxley (Max Von Sydow funny frail and moving) thinks this is a splendid idea but the real Roberts widow Marion (Cate Blanchett) is horrified. Robin and Marion -- what chance do you think these two kids will have? Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland manage to sort out this rugby scrum with surprising finesse. The movie underutilizes Matthew Macfadyens Sheriff of Nottingham but introduces a runty resourceful Friar Tuck (Mark Addy) who keeps beehives that sit there like Chekhovs gun waiting to go off. But ""Robin Hood recycles ""Gladiator more than it should -- Isaacs John is just a brattier version of Joaquin Phoenixs Commodus -- and it makes a fine hash of British history and geography setting the Magna Carta on fire in one scene and suggesting that everywhere in England is a 15-minute horse ride from everywhere else.Right; if Errol Flynns Robin didnt care about history neither should we. But that points out whats missing from Scotts version the derring-do the panache the joy in yanking the beards of the oppressors that was conveyed by Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks and even Sean Connery in the autumnal ""Robin and Marian. ""Robin Hood is a broad and lumbering affair made of heavy iron and flecked with mud and blood. Crowe shoulders the movies weight with the stolid charisma weve come to expect from him and he gets us to believe Robins hard-won goodness. But would it kill him to smile?Blanchetts Marion isnt exactly a party girl either (that duty falls to Lea Seydoux as Johns hot little consort Isabella of France). You welcome the actresss instinctive elegance though and admire Marions toughness in the face of everything the 12th century can throw at her. Yet the scripts ideas about women at times feel jarringly 21st century. Eleanor of Aquitaine trying to run the country through her sons is one thing; the noble Marion strapping on chainmail to fight the French invaders with the rest of the boys quite another.By that final battle ""Robin Hood has become as top-heavy as an overloaded siege wagon. At least the earlier action scenes are fleet and exciting with Scott using every trick in his well-appointed arsenal to put us in the midst of the frays. And thank goodness the director resisted studio pressure to convert the film to 3-D since a couple of POV arrow flights are convincing enough in two dimensions.That seriousness of purpose ultimately keeps ""Robin Hood earthbound though. In avoiding gimmickry Scott and company have forgotten the greater gimmick at the heart of this folktale the ease and humor thats as crucial a part of Robins rebellion against the crown as his arrows. The man was a primitive superhero. The movie turns him back into a man. You decide if thats what you want. For all this version does grimly right Im sticking with Flynn.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""Its all up there on the screen"" goes the inevitable defense when films arrive in theaters dogged by stories of their great expense. At least that claim is true with Ridley Scotts Robin Hood a film of knights in armor castles zipping arrows siege engines and horses horses horses. Of course it matters less what makes it to the screen than whats done with it once its there and while Scott is one of the few directors who could field-marshal this sort of spectacle and still deliver a coherent film simply ending up with a fitfully engaging behemoth of a movie isnt accomplishment enough. Image for image and shot for shot Scott is still one of the most striking directors around but in Robin Hood the cohesive particles keeping those images together--frills like a compelling plot and sculpted characters--prove unstable. Working from a script by Brian Helgeland Scott sidesteps the usual established elements of the Robin Hood story by offering a who-he-is-and-how-he-came-to-be origin story. Opening in the final days of Richard The Lionhearts return from the Third Crusade it characterizes Robin (Russell Crowe) as a world-weary soldier and gives him one great scene directly confronting Richard (Danny Huston) and calling out his king for the atrocities he forced Crowe to commit in the name of God and Crown. But any hint of a fresh take on the material pretty much ends there. After Crowe and his semi-merry thinly characterized men make their way to Nottingham to return a sword taken from a fallen knight he winds up posing as a dead man to help protect an aging taxed-to-the-point-of-poverty nobleman (Max von Sydow) and his fetching flinty widowed daughter-in-law Marion (Cate Blanchett). The film features a couple of memorable action sequences--including a climax that splices together elements from The Two Towers famous siege sequence and the opening of Saving Private Ryan. It gains some charismatic gravity from Crowe and Blanchett and an admirably plausible mist-and-mud-drenched depiction of 12th-century England. But the thin script--which revolves around a nonsensical secret origin for the Magna Carta--and a trebuchet-like pace work against its good points. So does Scotts blinkered workmanlike approach. Robin develops a socialists hatred of inequality and a Tea Partiers aversion to taxes but the film downplays the political subtext--or any sort of subtext--in the single-minded interest of hitting its target. It sticks it with the sound of a shrug. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Just Wright Next Movie Review After The Cup Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

But this Robin Hood is a more unpredictable beast while the shakycam action sequences effete young villain and moody presence of Russell Crowe hark back to the earlier film this is far closer to Scotts ambitious but unloved Kingdom of Heaven in its depiction of a world ruled by brute force and striving for moral direction.The opening act could even work as a sequel to that film fighting his way back from the Crusades in the army of Richard the Lionheart archer Robin Longstride decides to head for home when the King gets an arrow in the neck. By a series of unbelievable coincidences Robin finds himself posing as deceased nobleman Robert Locksley charged with taking news of the Lionhearts death back to his troublesome brother the new King John (Oscar Isaac).This kickstarts the long series of subterfuges political dirty deals and full-scale treachery that constitute the films wildly convoluted story. Its plots aplenty King John plots against his former Chancellor Marshall (a stately William Hurt); traitor Godfrey (Mark Strong) plots against John Robin and the entire English nation in concert with the devious King Philip of France; while Maid Marian (Cate Blanchett) and her ailing father-in-law (Max von Sydow) plot to keep Robin in Nottingham in the guise of the former Lord Locksley.Confused? You will be. Anyone expecting a straightforward woodland beat-em-up will be bemused and most likely dismayed by the intricacies of the narrative particularly when it becomes clear that Scott has been forced to trim back the action to fit in all these dastardly goings-on. Add a complete absence of characterisation some laughable accents (Crowe sounds like hes auditioning for Coronation Street) and a sense of history that would make Simon Schama scream and youve got the makings of what should be a tedious overblown disaster.But for all his faults Scott knows what hes doing. The film looks terrific the English landscape hasnt looked so lush and magical for a long time particularly in a clutch of gorgeous moonlit night scenes. Aesthetically its convincing which goes a long way towards offsetting the more nutty convolutions in the plot. And while characterisation has been cut to the bone Crowe Blanchett Strong and especially Von Sydow remain eminently watchable with strong likeable support from the likes of Mark Addy as Friar Tuck and Matthew MacFadyen as a marvellously greasy Sheriff of Nottingham.Best of all the film just feels huge genuinely epic in a way few movies have since Lord of the Rings. The endless plot twists may be perplexing but they work to make the movie feel eventful and involving after 140 minutes audiences will feel like theyve been somewhere lived through something. And so while this Robin Hood is a long way from perfect it remains a satisfyingly immense and old fashioned grand-canvas experience.

Here after over 2 hours which were basically retreads of Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven (though without the good music this time) we come to the ending which is truly ridiculous. Having fought alongside Robin Hood repelling the French on the beaches (ludicrously with Maid Marian also there in full armour) the King in the very next scene for no apparent reason and in a sudden outbreak of overacting declares Robin to be an outlaw to be hunted down for the rest of his days. It was as if Scott had suddenly discovered that he only had one minute left of the film and had forgotten completely to explain why Hood was supposed to be an outlaw.

A Robin Hood treatment closer to the historical figure than the more pantomine Costner outing of the 90s. Interesting play with the idea of Robins nobility here he was a yeoman yet asumed the title of the lord Robert of Locksley so he could outwardly play the role of the lord with its attached authority (and treat with his equals in times of battle) yet inwardly could still relate to his men and the people. Great acting throughout with Blanchett and von Sydow particularly good. Admiitedly the historical plotting slowed the film a bit and the scenes where Robin was bantering with his men where far more entertaining. However the film as a wholehad a large epic scale that suited the main drive of the plot with Robin as the leader of a social rebellion in England. In the final scene with the introduction of the Greenwood as much a character in the legend as any of the Merry Men there was a hint perhaps to a more action-packed guerilla-warfare style sequel.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 19 2010robin hoo??FeaturedI can see the attraction but its absolute pants.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 19 2010billFeaturedtruthteller????

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Robin Hood amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Trash Humpers Holy Rollers >> Robin Hood If 200 arrows fly through the woods do they make a sound? Ridley Scott spent some of his 200 million budget perfecting the ping-swoosh-whoosh-thwock-scream of a bow-and-arrow blitz just one of many grace notes in a blockbuster as handsome and untouchable as the captain of the football team. Russell Crowe stars as the socialistic archer--hes 10 years older than he was in Scotts Gladiator and he looks it but this is a film about a man old enough to have a breaking point. And hes still a beefcake. You can hear Cate Blanchetts bodice flutter when he grumbles ""I need help unfastening my chainmail."" Robin Hood picks up at the end of Richard the Lionhearts (Danny Huston) 10-year campaign. Sated--or chastened--by the mass slaughter of Muslims the Brits are on the march home and pillaging a few last French castles on the way. Crowe is just a two-bit archer but when the last battle goes bloody wrong he finds himself with the dead kings crown and a dead knights sword both of which he must return to their next of kin. And so hes set on his course to incite independence in the hearts of Englishmen sick of abasing themselves to the crown now on the head of Oscar Isaacs Prince John a fantastic little snot who has no idea his best friend is really a French double agent (great baddie Mark Strong) out to undermine his reign. Tea Partiers might thrill to the films message that every man should be free to fend for himself. Theyd have to ignore the digs that the countrys been bankrupted by a Persian Gulf war. While Robin Hood is as ambitious and smart as Gladiator as an enemy taxes dont have the glamour of man-eating lions. The film--and the cast--make all the right moves but we arent rallied to stand up and cheer. Still as summer films go its worth the tithe.

MEH-RY MEN Cannes audience indifferent about Robin Hood BREZNI-CANNES Live reports from the Cannes Film Festival TRAILER Should you join the merry men? The latest Robin Hood might as well be called John Doe in Chain Mail for all the resemblance it bears to the legendary character. That might not be so bad if the alternative portrait was intriguing. But Robin Hood as envisioned by Ridley Scott and scripted by Brian Helgeland is an unnecessary and wrong-headed reboot. Robin of the Hood spends a lot of time somberly shooting arrows a modicum of time proving his heroic decency especially around royals and a little time in the company of Lady Marion (no blushing maiden here). But whats missing is a sense of fun. The story plops the character of lore into real history specifically England at the end of the 12th century. He interacts with historical figures but that doesnt make this story any more compelling Russell Crowe in his fifth collaboration with Scott plays a familiarly taciturn courageousEveryman in a gloomy plot that is both complicated and uninvolving. His character has none of the outlaw charm the role demands. Cate Blanchett brings little but an arch toughness to the role of Marion and in a highly improbably climactic scene proves herself a veritable knight. Crowe and Blanchett share a perfunctory romance with few sparks. Crowe brings an intelligence to his roles but his distinctive quality of contained ferocity is best in multidimensional parts. Casting him in this is like renting a Ferrari for a spin to the corner store. Why waste his talent for something so prosaic? Other characters are one-note. The double-crossing Gottfried is played by the usually stand-out Mark Strong in his first by-the-book villain. Friar Tuck (Mark Addy) is a caricature at best as is the selfish Prince John (Oscar Isaac). Max von Sydow brings a nobility to Walter Loxley Marions father-in-law but his talents are squandered. William Hurt as Marshal a royal operative seems to give up on his English accent halfway through. The cinematography is stunning and the production design vividly evokes the era. But for a reported cost of 200 million it should look good. The score is stirring and moody. But the protracted battle scenes provide enough shots of flying arrows to last a lifetime. Perhaps the worst and most shameless aspect of this tedious affair is that its essentially a prequel for the Robin Hood better known for his redistribution of wealth. The film ends with the words ""The legend begins."" So why the needless back story? Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Scott already tackled the Crusades in the underrated Kingdom of Heaven and he collaborated with Russell Crowe on the epic Gladiator with its giant battle scenes in which arrows rained down like thunderstorms. Why go back and repeat yourself? Why bother with Sherwood Forest again after even Mel Brooks has trampled there? The answer lies in the script by Brian Helgeland which differs from all other Robin Hoods. This one is a prequel. This is the story of how Robin Longstride (Crowe) met and fell for Marion Loxley (Cate Blanchett) and how he made an enemy out of King John and how he befriended Friar Tuck and Little John and put together his band of Merry Men and why he started stealing from the rich to give to the poor. The movie ends with the title card ""And so the legend begins."" The film is over just when the story starts to get good. Scott is a diehard history buff and hes fond of telling interviewers ""I dont make movies. I create worlds."" You can see why he would have been lured by the opportunity to place a mythical folk hero into a complex plot about a 13th century French conspiracy to invade England. With Robin Hood Scott gets to reimagine the past and fixate on the fine details he adores such as the blob of wax that seals a tiny scroll carried by a messenger pigeon or the ornate metalwork on the stirrups Marion uses to ride her horse. Robin Hood is certainly a grand-looking picture. For a film thats filled with CGI effects there isnt a single shot that looks artificial and the production design is tremendous. But its a hollow boring spectacle. Crowe usually commits to his roles with a ferocious intensity but he doesnt really seem to believe in Robin. When you look into his eyes you see an actor trying to remember his lines. And the performances around him run the gamut. Oscar Isaac amusingly hams up the petulance of King John who becomes a bratty bully the second the crown of his late brother Richard I touches his head while William Hurt looks on the verge of REM sleep as a royal advisor whose purpose consists primarily of spouting exposition. Blanchetts Marion is more flinty and less prone to requiring rescue than previous incarnations but her romance with Robin isnt given enough screen time to develop so their relationship which should form the movies heart instead feels like a tacked-on romantic subplot. Robin Hood only comes to life in the climactic sequence a prolonged battle in which the French army disembarks on the British shore. The carnage is strongly reminiscent of the Omaha Beach invasion that opened Saving Private Ryan only with swords and arrows instead of rifles and grenades. The rest of Robin Hood which runs an excruciating 140 minutes is as dry as a geology lecture. When Max Von Sydow as Marions kindly blind father-in-law takes Crowe aside and says ""I think I have much to tell you about history"" my eyes started darting frantically for the theater exits because I was pretty certain someone in the audience was going to spontaneously combust from boredom. Scott has directed some dull long-winded pictures before (1492 The Conquest of Paradise) but hes never made one this pointless. Robin Hood achieves something you never would have thought possible it makes you nostalgic for Kevin Costner and Bryan Adams. Robin Hood (1/2 ouf of ) opens in South Florida on Friday May 14.

Thanks for the heads up. Ill still problably see it since I like the subject matter (medieval type movies) but I will be watching out for what you said. I might even wait for it to hit DVD. Granted I agree that 1492 was long winded but it wasnt a bad movie...considering the subject matter at hand. Although this time around we are talking about Robin Hood and not Columbus so action should take a front row seat. Maybe Scott wanted to go Epic instead of just making a great movie. What it seems he shouldve done is make it great and if it should turn out to be epic fine if not then thats fine too at least its a great movie. But it seems he ended up going overboard wanting to go epic so much that he instead just made it epically boring? Again thanks for the heads up. Posted by John | May 13 2010 at 1248 AM Why destroy my favorite hero. Where is Richard Green when you need him? Posted by Bruce | May 13 2010 at 0220 AM Does the fact that Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHaviland are not even mentioned say anything about where this movie ranks of the list of Robin Hood films? Posted by Shalom Wasserman | May 13 2010 at 0911 AM I think what makes it tedious is the fact that Crowe is starring again in a Ridley Scott movie. I thought Blanchette was good...she is so talented and steals some scenes. I thought Oscar Isaac also was good. Technically it was on the money...but I agree that it seemed more like a 140 minute trailer or teaser for the next movie. They did not even expand on the children in the forest...I hope Robin Hood 2 can make up for it. Posted by Disco23 | May 13 2010 at 1208 PM I like your take on the movie even if it is a bit harsher than my own take ( http//bit.ly/cRaCgQ ) I did think Hurt could have phoned in this performance. And I agree this is a movie in search of a sequel. Posted by Talyseon | May 17 2010 at 0106 AM I cant wait to watch this movie Russel Crowe is my all time favorite actor.

"Robin Hood review Before they were merry - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 3 starsRobin Hood review Before they were merryRobin Hoods early history gets a boost from CG Crowe and BlanchettMay 12 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticYou can dress it up or throw mud in its eye but the enduring appeal of the Robin Hood legend is simple treachery bested by archery. The other night Turner Classic Movies aired the evergreen 1938 classic ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" ( Errol Flynn in staggering three-strip Technicolor directed by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley) and followed up with the first screen version of the Sherwood Forest legend I ever saw as well as the sourest Robin Hood film yet made. I speak of ""Robin and Marian"" (1976) starring Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn depicted in James Goldmans screenplay as uneasily reunited middle-age lovers striving for a graceful retreat from a ceaselessly cruel world. What strikes me about the new ""Robin Hood"" directed by Ridley Scott is how its preoccupations and sensibilities lie almost precisely halfway between the derring-do of the 1938 film and the harsh revisionism of the 70s edition. The latest big-screen version of the outlaw myth marks the fifth collaboration between Scott and producer-star Russell Crowe. They made ""Gladiator"" a decade ago. If stylistic overlaps exist between that film and this one well no mystery Crowes fellow producer Brian Grazer is quoted by the films production notes as saying ""If we were going to make this film it had to be the Gladiator version of Robin Hood."" I wonder if 15-year-olds who just came out of ""Iron Man 2"" will have much interest in the movies paradoxically dour swagger its recasting of Robin Hood as the linchpin to key Middle Ages historical events. Whatever. I liked it. Its on a par with Scotts ""American Gangster"" No revelations but a satisfying large-scale genre movie toned up by its cast. Its an origin myth a prequel to the Robin of legend commonly associated with merry men and robbing from the rich and such. The action begins after the Third Crusade led by Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) has run its crimson course. Robin named Robin Longstride excels as an archer in King Richards army which hacks its way in retreat across France in the opening melee. For some the big opening will work because it accomplishes what Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland intended to give the movie a big opening. For others itll be pure chaos. ""Calm and careful"" Crowe tells a fellow archer at one point. ""Make it count."" The advice seems at odds with the direction. At times you long for the man who made ""The Duellists"" and ""Alien"" a generation ago when a director chose to establish a shot and actually hold it for a few seconds. After the blur of the first half-hour ""Robin Hoods"" rangy story begins to take shape. Assuming a dead noblemans identity Robin carries the crown of the late king to Eleanor of Aquitaine ( Eileen Atkins). Fulfilling his fallen comrades last request he then delivers the late noblemans sword to his widow and father played by Cate Blanchett and Max Von Sydow. Marion is nobodys maid or miss Shes tough as nails and quick with a zinger and only reluctantly does Blanchetts Marion agree to a financially expedient plan in which Robin will pretend ""Martin Guerre""-style to be her long-gone husband. Crowes performance technically immaculate is taciturn to the point of being a bit flat yet theres really nobody else youd want in the role. Like Crowe Blanchetts acting has a natural period sense though the love story gets some serious narrative competition in Helgelands other concerns. He juggles scarcely fewer storylines and intrigues than he did in ""L.A. Confidential."" Though Robins band of outlaw brothers provides boisterous comic relief theres not much merriment in the picture. When director Scott storms a castle he wants you to feel the danger and the thwwwunnnch of the arrow entering flesh. The panoramic computer-generated landscapes are miles ahead of anything in ""Gladiator."" Robins arrival in London on the late kings ship for example shows how CG can be used for cinematic-historical good as opposed to digital evil. The climactic battle with Frances King Philip has Robin essentially waging war against all Englands enemies from within and without. As history its silly. As entertainment it works. 3 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for violence including intense sequences of warfare and some sexual content) Cast Russell Crowe (Robin Longstride); Marion Loxley (Cate Blanchett); Max Von Sydow (Sir Walter Loxley); William Hurt (William Marshal); Mark Strong (Godfrey); Oscar Isaac ( Prince John); Danny Huston (King Richard); Eileen Atkins (Eleanor of Aquitaine) Credits Directed by Ridley Scott; written by Brian Helgeland; produced by Brian Grazer Scott and Russell Crowe.

"Movie review Robin Hood is all over the Sherwood Forest - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Robin HoodMovie review Robin Hood is all over the Sherwood ForestAn overly busy story line trips up Ridley Scotts take on the legendary archer which stars Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett.May 13 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Simultaneously simplistic and over-plotted revisionist and predictable... (David Appleby / Universal...)When you call a movie "" Robin Hood"" you set up expectations a gallant archer a maid named Marion a band of Merry Men a crusading king and a certain camaraderie in Sherwood Forest. The latest version has those elements but they dont play out in a way thats easy to recognize or respond to and thats a problem. Its an especially frustrating problem because the key creative people involved in the film are among the best in the business and their work here is for the most part solid. Director Ridley Scott is a contemporary master of wide screen action entertainment Oscar-winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland is coming off a strong showing in ""Green Zone"" and costars Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett Australians a long way from home clearly enjoy each others company. So what could be wrong? The difficulty is that this ""Robin Hood"" has been misconceived twice over. The first misstep albeit a defensible one was the decision to make this an origins story a kind of ""Robin Before the Hood."" While there is no lack of action and intrigue here those expecting traditional Robin Hood satisfactions will be left wondering if itd be asking too much to have the guys kicking back in Sherwood the way we remember them. Still origins stories are all the rage these days and with a property like the Robin Hood legends filmed literally dozens of times with actors such as Douglas Fairbanks Errol Flynn and Kevin Costner in the title role doing things differently (as Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn did in ""Robin and Marian"") is a justifiable way to go. What is harder to forgive is the cumbersome too-complicated story credited to Helgeland (who shares story credit with the ""Kung Fu Panda"" team of Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris). Simultaneously simplistic and over-plotted revisionist and predictable this ""Robin Hood"" has trouble getting untracked and once it does proves an awkward mix of international geopolitics repressed memory old-fashioned villainy human rights advocacy the Magna Carta and pigeons that send secret messages. Though most modern retellings of the legend place Robin in Sherwood circa 1185 around the time Richard the Lionheart leaves for the Crusades this ""Robin"" starts more than a decade later with the man in a different place. The future Hood is introduced in 1199 as one Robin Longstride (Crowe) a world-class archer in the service not of a noble monarch but a dispirited wreck of a King Richard (Danny Huston) a ruler whos put away a few too many brewskis and is fighting through France on his way home from the Holy Land. Circumstances free Robin and his pals Little John (Kevin Durand) Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes) and Allan ADayle (Alan Doyle) from the kings service and put them in the possession of the sword of a recently murdered friend of the kings Sir Robert Loxley. The sword has an intriguing inscription on it and Robin feels honor-bound to deliver it to Sir Roberts father. That would be the ancient and blind Sir Walter Loxley (the venerable Max Von Sydow) who lives in Nottingham with Sir Roberts feisty widow Marion (Blanchett). Circumstances throw everyone together (circumstances will do that in a movie like this) and after Robin asks Marion to chivalrously help him remove his chain mail there is little doubt where things will end up. While all this is going on all kinds of political shenanigans are taking place in London where villainous goateed Prince John (Oscar Isaac) is irking his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine ( Eileen Atkins) by spending his valuable royal time in bed with ""a bit of French pastry"" otherwise known as Isabella of Angouleme (Lea Seydoux). When he isnt playing house John is plotting to take over the country with the help of Sir Godfrey (bad-guy-du-jour Mark Strong) a man so perfidious he speaks English and French. Behind Johns back Godfrey turns out to be scheming with the French king and closing in on Nottingham and the stalwart Sir William Marshall ( William Hurt of all people) is spending his time palavering with a group of VIBs (Very Important Barons). Its enough to make you dizzy and not in a good way. Still there are some things to savor. Blanchett is an actress whos always involving and Crowe is very much in his element as an intrepid laconic archer who lets his arrows do the talking. He apparently spent untold months learning to shoot like someone raised in the Hood firing as many as 200 arrows a day in a relentless quest for accuracy. Its also true that director Scotts facility with the spectacle of battle makes everything he does worth investigating though this film finally lacks the clarity of his best work and misses the joy of the Robin Hoods that captivated previous generations. As it lumbers its way toward the finish line its hard not to wish that ""Robin Hoods"" plot was as nailed down as all those on-target arrows. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Clicking on Green Links will take you to a third-party e-commerce site.

A scene in which he dons a disguise to win an archery contest or gets Friar Tuck to carry him across a stream or leaves the Sheriff of Nottingham fulminating in his boots. A moment when Robins men behave in a way that could remotely be described as ""merry."" A rousing sword fight. A pinch of lightness frivolity comedy adventure or -- wait I think this is the word Im searching for -- fun. The new Robin Hood you see is an origin story a prequel to the legend which is why it contains virtually none of the famous and invigorating scamp-of-the-woods mythology. Now Im all for a new take on an old story. But Scott and his screenwriter Brian Helgeland work so mightily to turn Robin ? into a stolidly noble pre-notorious version of himself that they forget to make him at all magical. Rousing. A hero of the glen. The filmmakers drown us in ""realism"" with a cast of actors mangy enough to look like entrants in a medieval drinking contest. And the way Crowe plays Robin which is heavily without ever once modulating his impassive minimalist squint hes far too even-keeled to inspire us. Hes like the hero of Gladiator only without a vengeful mission -- or a slave to fight. The movie works hard to set up Robin as a valiant outsider. He starts off as an archer in the army of King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) and amid much generic slaughter the movie calls on him to give an anachronistic speech about how a Crusade against Muslims is not something that God would approve of. He then travels all the way to Nottingham to report the death of his comrade Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge) -- quite a trek for a Good Samaritan impulse. Once there Robin joins the Loxley clan but Scott having dosed us with an early case of battle fatigue never finds a dramatic tone. Max von Sydow as the grizzled Walter Loxley gives his rare annoying performance; he tries to be knowing but just comes off as coyly belligerent. And Cate Blanchett as Lady Marion (the widow of Sir Robert) comports herself with such proud strong-as-any-man severity that theres no softness or romance to her. When she helps Robin off with his chain mail its supposed to be erotic but the two might as well be making a bookcase. The scene builds to a carefully angled image of Robin with his shirt off and about all we can think looking at Crowes muscular but still doughy torso is that he must have worked out for months for this token beefcake shot. Forget valor and excitement. Scotts Robin Hood is all about backstory great teeming gobs of royal-court strategizing and double-crossing oppression. The movie features a newly crowned monarch the weakling tyrant King John (Oscar Isaac) who is mad for taxes. Hes also short enough to have the 12th-century version of a Napoleon complex which hes too obvious in his treachery to hide. His right-hand man the more devious Godfrey is a saboteur who is secretly collaborating with King Philip of France. Mark Strong as Godfrey is creepy like a feral chrome-domed Steve Carell with a stitched scar next to his mouth (where Robin shot him with an arrow). But that scar is just about the only thing that connects Robin to all the by-the-numbers political chicanery. Scott and Crowe made a great movie out of Gladiator tapping deep into the showbiz masculine bravura of ancient-world Hollywood spectaculars. In Robin Hood Scott tries to go deep again but in a misguided way -- he thinks hes making a pop-medieval Saving Private Robin. The battles are grainy and ""existential"" but what they arent is thrilling. Theyre surging crowd scenes with streams of arrows and flecks of blood and Crowe slashing his way through them is a glorified extra. Hes so grimly possessed with purpose that hes a bore and so is the movie. C- See all of this weeks reviews Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

"Robin Hood Boring story little action | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRobin Hood Boring story little actionRobin Hood which had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival today buckles under the weight of its leaden screenplay says Peter Howell.Russell Crowe stars in the Ridley Scott movie Robin Hood.  (Greg Williams)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. May 12 2010 Robin Hood (out of 4)Starring Russell Crowe Cate Blanchett Mark Strong Oscar Isaac Max von Sydow and William Hurt. Directed by Ridley Scott.CANNES FRANCE -- The swash buckles under the weight of heavy verbiage in Robin Hood Ridley Scotts well-intended but weakly executed retelling of the ancient woodland hero legend.The avowed point of this umpteenth version of Robin Hood which had its world premiere Wednesday at the Cannes Film Festival in advance of Fridays wide theatrical release is to get back to basics -- just as the James Bond franchise did so spectacularly with Casino Royale.Indeed Scotts vision is so down and dirty his Robin (an unconvincing Russell Crowe) has to be told to take a bath at one point because he smells so badly. Crowes burly Robin wears leather and chain mail rather than the green leotards of folklore. Article Continued BelowBut its hard to be simple when the characters are hobbled by Brian Helgelands leaden screenplay which clumsily combines historical fact about cross-Channel antagonism and British domestic concerns about excessive taxation and human rights with the almost complete fiction of Robin Hood and his romancing of Lady Marion.Helgeland puts great gobs of exposition into the mouths of the actors while advancing the story at a snails pace. Despite a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes the film ends at the point where Robin Hood is given his full name and recognition as a ""rob from the rich give to the poor"" hero which suggests that a Robin Hood 2 would be much more interesting than whats on view here.Scott doesnt help matters. What few fight scenes there are suffer from an excess of confusing close-ups and a dearth of action.The film is entirely back story spending almost as much time building up Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett) as it does illuminating Robins growth from abandoned child into the rebel challenger of cruel British monarch King John (Oscar Isaac) the man who will ultimately sign the Magna Carta of rights and freedoms. Blanchetts Marion is ludicrously presented as a 12th-century protofeminist fighting both French and British villains not just with the boys but almost as one of them.Blanchett admitted as much in the news conference immediately following the morning screening.""I always wanted to be Robin Hood rather than Maid Marion"" she said.She radiates zero sex appeal in her encounters with Robin whom she first meets as a man impersonating her late warrior husband Sir Robert Loxley. Crowe spends much of the film imitating Loxley a narrative ruse designed more to facilitate his meeting with Marion than to credibly advance the plot.Marion is the first to fire an arrow in anger in the film a flaming bolt she sends to warn off grain thieves at her impoverished familys Nottingham farm.In contrast Crowes Robin Hood is slow to anger and action. He shows more spirit playing a shell game with his soon-to-be merry man Little John (Kevin Durand) than he does on the field of battle.This is Crowes fifth teaming with helmer Scott and it ranks far below their 2000 high point with the Oscar-blessed Gladiator where they got the heroics just right. Its perhaps just a notch above their low point 2006s A Good Year their ill-advised attempt at romantic comedy.Robin Hood is so stripped of colour as to be almost black-and-white and its almost devoid of humour. In fact forget what youve heard about Robins ""merry"" men who mainly act as uncouth and surly brutes. The closest the picture comes to humour are two groaners about penis size -- as in hey where did Little Johns nickname come from? Mark Addy does make for a respectable Friar Tuck albeit one who is presented as being too fond of the alcoholic honey mead beverages he brews. Mark Strong once again plays the bad guy as the duplicitous Godfrey supposed friend of King John (forsooth Strong should call his agent) and Danny Huston plays a surprisingly good King Richard the Lionheart whose failed Crusades set the tale in motion.Crowe told journalists he was attracted to the project which he also co-produced because it promised to be unlike any Robin Hood film hes ever seen -- and hes seen them all from the derring-do of the Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks movies to the Mel Brooks satire of Robin Hood Men In Tights.None of them until now have dealt with Robins motivation for challenging King Johns authority Crowe said. What made Robin the rebel he became?""There are so many Robin Hoods made. But personally I dont feel one is satisfactory in terms of its human element"" Crowe said.People will have to revise their view of Robin Hood to really get this movie he cautioned.""Whatever you think youve been told about Robin Hood is a previously understandable mistake.""And while both Crowe and Blanchett agreed that Robin Hood is intended to have resonance with modern times -- allusions to the Iraq War are obvious -- Crowe said he didnt think the reckless bankers of Wall Street would be in Robins crossbow sights in 2010.""In my view if Robin was alive today hed be looking at the monopolization of the media.""Be thankful they didnt make that part of the movie and also that it didnt run the length Crowe originally envisioned. He only half-jokingly said he wanted the story to be 71/2 hours long. Unlike jury bosses past who made their political views known Burton said he wants his crew to show ""compassion to any filmmaker"" they watch amongst the 19 films competing for the Palme and to leave all assumptions at the door of the screening room.""Were all sensitive to calling ourselves judges"" he said.""Our job is to be completely open and to not have preconceived ideas.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Robin Hood Fair to good Director Ridley Scott. Cast Russell Crowe Cate Blanchett Max von Sydow. Rating Rated PG-13 for violence including intense sequences of warfare and some sexual content. RELATED 100 years of Robin Crowe joins Flynn Connery Crowe brings scruffy new look to Robin Hood Russell Crowe respects Ridley Scott Spotlight Russell Crowe Spotlight Cate Blanchett Adventure movies Hes not there yet. Scotts epic - and its hard to think of anything this big this elaborate and no doubt this expensive as anything but - is very much an origination story a prequel if you will. (He even ends with a beginning setting up for a sequel should the desire arise.) Russell Crowe teaming with Scott for the fifth time is back in fighting trim leading the English people and the audience right along with it in a surprisingly satisfying new take on the well-told tale. Its a little too obvious and ham-handed in places to be a really good movie but any film that lasts two hours and 20 minutes without seeming like a long hard slog cant be all bad. The movie begins at the end of the 12th century with Robin Longstride (Crowe) as an archer in service to King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) who is busy working his way back to England after his crusades. Richard wont make it which turns the crown over to his younger diabolical brother John (Oscar Isaac) who immediately (like within seconds) adopts a plan to heavily tax his subjects with predictably unpopular results. (Where was Fox News to fan the flames of outrage?) John is spurred on by Godfrey (Mark Strong who may be doomed to a career of playing English bad guys but is awfully good at it). Godfrey . . . speaks French This signals villain throughout the centuries apparently. Godfrey is in fact in league with the French assisting their plans for invasion; he figures an England at war with itself will be easier to conquer. (This is not the film from which to learn accurate English history by the way.) Robin meanwhile had assumed the identity of a dying soldier Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge) to get home from battle. He promised he would return Loxleys sword to his father. Thus Robin and his men not yet merry but a pretty happy lot arrive at the home of Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) a blind old man presiding over a crumbling estate. He suggests that Robin continue to pretend to be his son and the husband to Lady (not Maid) Marion (Cate Blanchett) so that they can keep their land in the family. Fine by Robin even if Marion something akin to a pre-feminism feminist is not so sold on the idea. Sir Walter knows a lot about Robin it turns out teasing him with details of memories Robin has suppressed of his father and his childhood. If thats not enough a band of orphans roams around a sort of Lost Boys of Nottingham who will figure into the final battle. So too will Robin of course and Marion but not before Robin basically lays the groundwork for the signing of the Magna Carta. Busy guy. That final battle with French soldiers storming the beaches of England is very much a 12th century version of ""Saving Private Ryan"" meaning arrows whiz through the air and water not bullets. Scott is quite adept at this kind of thing as he shows earlier during castle sieges. (The rain of arrows is particularly intriguing. Its amazing anyone gets out alive.) Where ""Robin Hood"" falls short is in Scotts choices too much of this too little of that. Robin and Marion would have been better off simply as wary friends at this point for instance; a romance even one in budding stages seems hurried and forced. And we dont see much of the likes of Little John (Kevin Durand) Friar Tuck (Mark Addy) and Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes). Even the Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfayden) is a bit player a toady with non-existent loyalties. However the acting is mostly first-rate throughout bringing a contemporary feel to the movie without overdoing it. Crowe is no stranger to playing the strong silent type though it might be nice if he smiled every now and then. Von Sydow is outstanding as a man who avoids grief by building a new life for himself and his family. William Hurt is particularly good as William Marshal an advisor to Richards court whom John has less use for - or so he thinks. While subtlety isnt exactly Scotts strong suit both Hurt and Isaac offer some fine small moments in a really big movie. ""Robin Hood"" would have been better off with more of them. A late scene in which the Sheriff calls for a nail while posting a bill for Robins arrest drives that point home with the impact of a perfectly placed arrow.

Its certainly something of a surprise. When the movie was announced in 2007 with the title Nottingham reports suggested that it would sympathize with the normally vilified Sheriff of Nottingham as a man torn between two extremes the corrupt tax-happy monarchy and Robin Hood himself who in this version would be a self-serving rabble-rouser whod play on the emotions of the struggling public to incite anarchy. Russell Crowe was at first cast as the sheriff; a year later Scott told MTV News that his frequent leading man would play both the famed outlaw and his lawman rival to better reveal the affinities between the two.The film Scott ended up making is called Robin Hood the sheriffs role is minimal and Crowe plays only the title character whose ability to mobilize commoners with empty anti-government rhetoric equating taxation with slavery is posited as a virtue. It is an old-fashioned adventure epic produced with state-of-the-art cosmetics lined with mild romantic farce and weighed down by overly simplistic quasi-populist dialogue. Instead of robbing from the rich to give to the poor this Robin Hood preaches about ""liberty"" and the rights of the individual as he wanders a countryside populated chiefly by Englishpersons bled dry by government greed. Conservatives will never again be able to complain that Hollywood ignores their interests but the driving agenda behind the Nottingham makeover was most likely economic Robin Hood is above all a boilerplate origin story finely engineered to set up a franchise.As King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston) and his army pillage their way back to England from the Crusades royal younger brother John (Oscar Isaac) is shacked up with the niece of the French king. When the Queen mum interrupts her sons coitus to lecture him for being a foolish slut and taking up with one of the same he announces his diabolical plan to marry the French broad and nab the throne from his aging brother. Before Mom can huff ""Something must be done about these power-mad horny kids"" Richard is killed by Godfrey (Mark Strong) an Englishman turned secret operative for the French who the newly crowned still-foolish King John unwittingly hires to violently enforce the mass taxation that will fund his royal decadence.Who should stumble upon Richards corpse but Robin Longstride a ""common archer"" plagued by fuzzy flashbacks of the day a good 30 years previous when his father ""left me to the world of men."" Robert Loxley a sidekick to the King who lays dying at the scene presses Robins daddy-issues button and convinces him to take the Loxley family sword back to Papa Walter Loxley (Max Von Sydow) in Nottingham.The younger Sir Loxley failed to mention that Walter lives with Marian (Cate Blanchett) the headstrong barely-noblewoman Robert married on the eve of decamping for war a decade earlier. When Robin arrives in Nottingham Walter insists that he protect both himself and whats left of the Loxley land by play-acting as Marians dead husband. The second act of the film is largely taken up with the budding relationship between Robin and Marian--or rather the gradual process by which her proto-feminist resolve is crumbled by his general bemusement at her confidence and self-sufficiency. Just as this union is on the verge of consummation Walter reveals the truth about Robins father the landowners threaten to rise up against the royals the French army storms . . . something and the English king has to make political concessions to his people so that theyll march for him instead of against him in a great partially underwater battle in which Marian learns why chainmail generally doesnt come in ladies sizes.Much like Avatar Robin Hood seemingly seeks to wow through assault--the soundtrack is loud and extraordinarily dense the pace is relentless the battle scenes are choreographed for total sensory disorientation the war of the story is too convoluted to keep track of without the aid of press notes--but whats actually interesting about the construction of both movies are the moments at which technological trickery supports the classical filmmaking rather than absorbing it. From the warm pulsing grain of the digitally enhanced natural light to the muted blanket of sound coming off a rain of arrows there are quietly ecstatic aesthetic flourishes buried within Robin Hoods clutter.But the clutter is paramount. Scott mainly filters a 1000-year-old myth through the stale shorthand of the action blockbusters of the past two decades. We travel with arrows in Matrix-esque bullet time; emotion is underlined through zooms and slo-mo; the villains have bad facial hair and/or speak in quasi-philosophical metaphor (""Even dying animals can be obstinate"" the king of France sneers addressing the oyster hes trying to open but he really means England). The directorial choices are for the most part so lazy the blockbuster engineering so blatant that Robin Hood often falls into self-parody. All the more reason for Sarah Palin to love it.

(Brown/AP) Joe Neumaier Updated Wednesday May 12 2010 221 PM Title Robin Hood When it comes to fun Robin Hood movies either youre in or youre an outlaw.The problem with Russell Crowes new take on the legend is that it has one muddy boot in history and the other in fantasy. The middling result is far from a bulls-eye.""Robin Hood"" which opens Friday after kicking off the 63rd Cannes Film Festival Wednesday tells the origin of an indignant Englishman who became the original dark knight. Yet while director Ridley Scott (""Gladiator"") has a veterans sure hand the movie lacks a rebel yell.In 1199 stern and drab Robin Longstride (a name straight out of a Mel Brooks parody) is an archer fighting for King Richard the Lionheart (miscast Danny Huston). During Richards final Crusade Robin is accused of disloyalty but escapes after Richard is killed.Upon finding the dead kings crown Robin sets out for London where Richards weak brother John (Oscar Isaac) leads and his man Godfrey (Mark Strong) is in cahoots with the French. Taking a fallen soldiers title Robin goes to Nottingham and meets the soldiers widow Lady Marion of Loxley (Cate Blanchett brandishing swords as sharp as her cheekbones).Through a patchwork quilt of a plot Robin goes from archer to nobleman to commoner and finally to enemy of the duplicitous King John and the movie ends where most of the folk-hero adventures begin.Heavy on grit yet light as a feather ""Robin Hood"" avoids the gloss of Errol Flynns Kevin Costners and Disneys 1950s versions. The result is a split arrow On one hand the creation of the Magna Carta is presented as a rousing plot point while on the other is Marions swashbuckling role reversal and a series of throaty empty ""Braveheart""-like platitudes.The star meanwhile is a Maximus-ized Robin galumphing through battles that are undeniably impressive. Still even in a more dignified green-and-brown tunic Crowe relies on standard Robin Hood moments like his brawny bonhomie with Little John (Kevin Durand) and Friar Tuck (a perfect Mark Addy).Crowes intensity drives the meandering story and his scenes with Blanchett are akin to old-fashioned star matches; the Oscar-winning pair seize every chance they can to actually act. Ultimately though ""Robin Hood"" is a blockbuster mostly stuck in the stockades.

""Can you not sing a happy tune?"" growls a not-so-merry man in ""Robin Hood"" and one might direct the same question at Ridley Scotts grimly revisionist take on Englands most famous outlaw. Impressively made and serious-minded to a fault this physically imposing picture brings abundant political-historical dimensions to its epic canvas yet often seems devoted to stifling whatever pleasure audiences may have derived from the popular legend. With a brawny Russell Crowe in the title role pic looks to hit its B.O. target in most markets though overall muted reactions may hold Universal back from a kings ransom Stateside. While the film will earn immediate comparisons with 2004s gritty unromantic ""King Arthur"" what Scott and scribe Brian Helgeland have attempted here is not too dissimilar from what Christopher Nolan and his collaborators pulled off with ""Batman Begins"" Theyve fashioned a fresh origin story for a well-known hero and excised all the materials potentially campy aspects in favor of a downbeat detail-oriented realist approach. To that end there are tricky political allegiances and family ties to be sorted out; characters are as likely to be assaulted by speeches as by arrows; the French though clearly perceived here as the enemy are at least allowed to speak their native tongue; and every castle and forest must be painstakingly identified to the point that ""Robin Hood"" comes to resemble a medieval ""Bourne"" movie as it darts hither and yon from Nottingham to the northern coast of France. Its 1199 A.D. and Robin Longstride (Crowe who produced with Scott and Brian Grazer) is an honorable Briton and skilled archer in the crusading army of King Richard (Danny Huston) -- who in contrast to most versions of the story appears at the beginning rather than the end. Fed up with their lot as soldiers Robin and his men -- who include a slimmer-than-usual Little John (Kevin Durand) contributing a few moments of bawdy humor -- flee a battle with French soldiers shortly after Richard himself is killed in action. A few skirmishes later Robin finds himself in possession of the late monarchs crown which he bears back to London disguised as a knight of the realm Sir Robert Loxley. Along the way the film introduces its principal villains although Richards cruel successor John (Oscar Isaac) turns out to be a mere tool for his suspiciously bilingual adviser Godfrey (chrome-domed Mark Strong once again typecast). While Godfrey sets the stage for a Gallic invasion sabotaging Johns relations with the local barons and their ruthlessly overtaxed citizens Robin nobly seeks out the family of the fallen Sir Robert. The journey leads him to Nottingham where he meets the knights aging father Sir Walter (Max von Sydow) and his widow Lady Marion -- no damsel in distress but a dagger-wielding spitfire played with relish by Cate Blanchett. The pairing of two such estimable actors as Crowe and Blanchett alone signals the films serious intentions and as a perhaps inevitable consequence Robin and Marions courtship is in no hurry to catch fire. Something similar could be said of the film whose leisurely buildup rarely translates into a sense of intellectual vigor and pays few emotional dividends. Essentially 139 minutes worth of backstory ""Robin Hood"" feels too long yet incomplete and the events it leaves offscreen (for what the sequel?) are precisely those that make the tale worth retelling. Clearly a long way from Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn (and to no ones complaint Kevin Costner) pic cant help but play like a joyless corrective to Robin Hoods prior screen adventures with their buoyant mix of wit romance green tights and derring-do. (This film offers mainly derring-dont.) A certain nagging political correctness is also apparent not only in the recasting of Blanchetts Marion as a 12th-century feminist but in the way Robin rebukes Richard and the folly of the Crusades a scene that brings Scotts ""Kingdom of Heaven"" to mind. Similarly Robins stirring speech on the brotherhood of man (its a quasi-Ken Loach moment laying the foundation for the Magna Carta) recalls Scott and Crowes superior first collaboration ""Gladiator"" (2000). Now 10 years older (and paunchier) Crowe still has the sullen brooding and iron-clad sense of righteousness down pat. But theres no twinkle of merriment in his eyes nothing to suggest a man who would not only be outraged by poverty and injustice but wily enough to make sport of those responsible. Among supporting players Isaac channels ""Gladiators"" Joaquin Phoenix as a fey yet ruthless tyrant; Eileen Atkins serves up a formidable Eleanor of Aquitaine; William Hurt brings subtle shadings to the role of a chancellor in whom Robin finds a shrewd ally; and Matthew Macfadyen sneers his way through a few scenes as the Sheriff of Nottingham. But its von Sydow who gives the films most heartrending turn as a man trying to smother his grief with a boisterous fighting spirit. Though heavier on talk than action pic does boast some robust setpieces amplified by Marc Streitenfelds urgent score and d.p. John Mathiesons vertiginous crane shots somewhat marred by distracting camera effects in an otherwise stylistically old-fashioned film. One must be grateful that Universal avoided the current blockbuster trend toward 3D especially considering the eye-popping possibilities afforded by archery. Other craft contributions are generally superb though some touches such as the illuminated manuscripts that serve as expository visual aids only compound the films self-seriousness.
