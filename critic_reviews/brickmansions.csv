"All Class The Surprisingly Subversive Brick Mansions << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com All Class The Surprisingly Subversive Brick Mansions Movies April 25 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print 2004s District B13 is a crime thriller produced and cowritten by Luc Besson set inside an ugly marginal Parisian public-housing complex beset with drug lords heavy artillery and parkour. Loosely it involves a thug and a cop squaring off against the complexs gangsters. The thug and cop are white. The drug lord and his henchmen are Arab and African. And every time the racial politics are about to make you roll your eyes a long foot chase culminates with someone hopping up the side of a building or flying through a transom. Good parkour will do that. Eventually a bomb a rocket and some class conspiracy arrive and the movie goes from cartoonish action to scandalous incrimination. After I saw it I had only two words -- Bra. Vo. -- and one thought This deserves to be a hit in the U.S. but its too French. Not anymore. Being the ingenious opportunist he is Besson has concocted a remake. Brick Mansions is just like B13 but set in Detroit with Paul Walker and RZA. It too adheres to its own logic which is to say it adheres to almost none at all. Walker plays Damien the undercover cop who at the behest of the city and to avenge his murdered father winds up inside Detroits Brick Mansions ghetto a desolate mini metropolis made of crime and concrete. He teams with Lino (David Belle) a stand-up ruffian who trashes bags and bags of a kingpins stash flees in high-flying style and then returns after the kingpin (RZA) makes off with Lola (Catalina Denis) Linos girl. This isnt an American version per se. It was filmed in Canada and youre never entirely convinced Besson didnt pick Detroit because if said wrong ""Detroit"" sounds French. None of the accents or cadences or phrasing make sense. Belle is a handsome French stunt choreographer who starred in the first movie and its only somewhat less outlandish 2009 sequel. Like almost everyone else here he sounds dubbed. The camera rarely lingers long enough on any face to let you know whats going on. After a while even Walkers Southern California-surfer line delivery seems suspiciously foreign -- and not just for Detroit. The whole movie feels somehow even more cartoonishly European than B13. But the plot twist still really gets to the audience. This is ultimately -- frankly too ultimately (you feel all 89 minutes) -- a movie about class warfare and social oppression that isnt remotely science-fictional. Its real and as dumb as this remake is it sends you home thinking. Having RZA explain the conspiracy as he does was probably unnecessary but hes got all the best lines. So why not? (The night I saw the movie he did an introduction and then sat down with a soda and a bag of popcorn and watched the whole thing.) Even so by the time one character drives to an actual mansion in a BMW youre pretty sure Besson has forgotten what this movies about and where its set. But director Camille Delamarre was until this film -- his first -- an editor. Working with a good cinematographer (Christophe Collette) and stunt coordinator (Alexandre Cadieux) he knows how to stage and assemble an action sequence for maximum jolt. Im fond of the slow-motion reverse shots he provides for foot-to-face or lighting fixture-to-body impacts. Theres a lot less parkour than in the original movie. Belle is thicker and less airborne now than he was in 2004. But hes the only guy in the movie who knows how to move like this. (Cyril Raffaelli played the cop in B13 and he was as athletic as Belle; the movie is basically a love affair between their different kineses.) Ten years ago parkour was edgy urban disruption (acrobatics for clean breaks) and so chic that Madonna stole it for one of her world tours. It made insurgent sense in B13. Now its just a cool thing Belle can do. There is a good moment when Lino escapes RZAs goons through a tight transomlike space and Damien has to improvise a noisier more labor-intensive exit. Walker died last year in a car accident and this is said to be his last complete film. You get the sense that Brick Mansions was just Besson capitalizing on Walkers automotive bona fides which the movies of course are going to miss. He gets one happy scene behind the wheel of a Mustang that leaves Belle impressed and implausibly terrified. When Walker was driving he was a star.

Now rundown Detroit is the key location in this same-again reboot. The death of co-star Paul Walker will probably garner the film more attention than it deserves since it follows the bog-standard formula perfected by the French filmmaking powerhouse it combines functional storylining with competent action highlights and an occasional air of whimsy. This time series mainstay David Belle hops skips and jumps his way through another non-acting turn as the street-tough idealist out to stop drug lord RZA flooding the streets while undercover cop Walker (stolid as ever) has his own family reasons for targeting the narcotics kingpin. Chases on foot and four wheels keep the thing moving but apart from a thematic wrinkle where Bessons clearly siding with the hood rather than the lawmakers its all pretty predictable. RZA seems way too cool for this shameless filler but he does keep a straight face while evidently sending up the role in not one but two sequences where the badass dude shows off his cooking skills.

The rest are in the pocket of drug kingpin Tremaine Alexander (rapper RZA) or doing the evil bidding of the conniving mayor (Bruce Ramsay).REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThe action takes place in 2018 amid a dystopian urban wasteland. Military-style compounds are formed around the crime-ridden zones that were once brick mansions walling residents in.Lino (David Belle) who grew up in this desperate corner of the Motor City is a one-man justice squad. Hes done jail time. But his aim is true to rid his neighborhood of the drugs crime and lawlessness that have overtaken it. Tremaine and legions of gun-toting lieutenants go after Lino for impeding their lucrative drug operation. It helps that Lino has more moves than Jagger and can deftly climb leap flip roll and vault while he fights off all comers. Belle co-founded the physical training discipline of Parkour and his way with stylized stunts is the other reason to see this film. (Parkour is the art of moving through environments using only the momentum of the human body to overcome obstacles.)The rest of the movie is a blur of whizzing bullets and bad dialogue.Though Tremaine claims to be a businessman -- and an avid if not inventive chef -- for much of the movie he threatens to blow up downtown Detroit with a bomb-and-missile combo he acquired from the Russians.When someone in law enforcement refers to it as a neutron bomb hes quickly hushed. No b-words please. ""We prefer the term device "" says a city official. ""Bomb has such negative connotations.""Damien is paired with Lino by police superiors and instructed to dismantle the bomb.A surprising highlight is a face-off between Lino Damien and ""the Yeti"" (Robert Maillet) a 7-foot henchman of Tremaines whose vocabulary is limited to grunts and growls that recall Mongo in Blazing Saddles.French action director Luc Besson wrote the screenplay a remake of the 2004 French film District B-13.French stuntman/actor Belle reprises his role from that film.The pace is often frenetic as the story hinges on chases fistfights and the ubiquitous use of guns and other available weaponry (including steel chains whips bricks cement blocks and heads for butting).But watching Belle scale walls plunge headfirst through windows and flip down a hallway as if hes in Cirque du Soleil is an impressive sight particularly since its a spectacle achieved without wires special effects or digital assists.Walker and Belle collaborate on choreographed stunts in dynamic and sometimes comical ways. Its fun to see Walker do a double take at a perilous move of Belles and then find a less risky alternative. The pair seem like theyre having a good time in this buddy action movie. It seems a fitting curtain call for a likable actor gone too soon.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A Detroit police officer goes under cover with a gang that has access to a weapon of mass destruction in the new thriller Brick Mansions.

Kings classic ""Stand By Me"" by the DJ and electronic musician KiTheory that auto-plays on Brick Mansions official website is a more variegated cover version than the film itself which is an uglier English-language remake of the Paris-set dystopian action picture District B13 with the dubious addition of RZA as a drug lord whose subordinates might understand him better if he didnt rely so heavily on metaphors related to his mothers cooking. Hes the villain here not the soundtrack composer he was for Jim Jarmuschs great weird modern-day Bushido-code flick Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai. But thats typical Almost no one in this film is allowed to play to their strengths. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - No one that is except David Belle the parkour pioneer who reprises his role from B13 as Lino ne Leito the Good Man Trying to Clean Up the Ghetto. He keeps pissing off his nemesis Tremaine Alexander (RZA) by stealing his dope and destroying it. In the scant spare time this crusade allows him he enjoys performing inverted sit-ups hanging from a pipe.In the decade since the original picture (redundant though it is how a remake took this long is anyones guess) Belle has turned 40 which means now he looks less like Shia Labeouf and actually wears a shirt for one or two scenes but he still moves like a cat bitten by a radioactive spider. Watching him evade Alexanders henchmen by swinging from conveniently exposed plumbing lines cannonballing from window to window (open closed doesnt matter) and clambering up fire escapes faster than most people can sprint over flat ground inspires awe at the ingenious machine that is the human body. And for viewers of a certain age an overwhelming urge to play Donkey Kong.Film Details Brick Mansions RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time90 More Info Trailer A fake news-footage montage running less than a minute lets us know were in 2018 Detroit its inner city now ringed by a razor-wire-topped wall and military checkpoints to keep the vermin in. As in the original RoboCop the Motor City is a hellscape so far beyond saving that the powers that be just want to raze it and start over. Also as in RoboCop the Motor City gets its name dragged through the mud without even being afforded the small dignity of playing itself. Brick Mansions -- which exists only because American audiences will not turn out for any movie even a kickass action thriller like B13 that talks French -- was shot in Montreal the worlds second-largest francophone city after Paris.The story hasnt changed much. Fearless undercover cop Damien Collier is dispatched into the walled city (now called""Brick Mansions"") to recruit Linos aid in locating and disarming a stolen WMD. ""We prefer the term device one of Colliers armchair-general bosses says between sips of cognac. ""Bomb has such negative connotations."" Collier will have to fight that rapscallion Lino a few times before he figures out Linos more honorable and trustworthy than his superiors. The screenplay is credited to B13 co-writers Luc Besson and Bibi Naceri which makes it difficult to know who we should thank for the English dialogue. Before Lino and Collier perform a synchronized back flip Lino waxes philosophic ""Ready for a back flip?"" Butch Cassidy amp; The Sundance Kid this is not.Collier gets a new backstory about his killed-in-the-line-of-duty father and Ayisha Issa plays a heavy with no precedent in the original because someone decided it was necessary to threaten Linos just-here-to-be-a-hostage-girlfriend with girl-on-girl sexual assault. One wonders if RZA mightve had script input seeing how he gets to drop a Wu Tang Clan lyric at one point and that his character gets a not-in-the-original whiff of third-act redemption that asks us to forget that we watched him coldly execute a pair of his own minions earlier in the picture.Otherwise this is an almost scene-for-scene remake -- but not a shot-for-shot remake which likely would have been more enjoyable. First-time director Camille Delamarre is an experienced editor of action pictures with numbers in them. He cut Taken 2 and Transporter 3; next hes directing Transporter 4 and after that who knows? A Jackson Five biopic maybe. Alas he does the spry Belle no favors by so wantonly using jittery-lens and slow-motion effects. Brick Mansions runs about 10 minutes longer than its precursor and already looks more dated in part because Delamarre has grossly overestimated the visual appeal of slo-mo replays of glass shattering and stacks of boxes falling down. The longer smoother takes of B13 which let us see that Belle was performing his incredible stunts for real at his own risk and on his own knees were far more thrilling. Of course its a cliche to complain that todays action movies look more like video games than actual motion pictures; those stutter-frame effects make this particular game look like its being played on a computer that needs a better graphics card.With its talent-squandering choppy action it recalls the Rush Hour franchise wherein Brett Ratner took Jackie Chan -- who was getting on in years by then but still one of the most ingenious physical performers in the history of cinema -- and shot his fights in short confusing close-ups as one would when trying to hide the physical limitations of an actor who cant really do this stuff. Like say Rush Hour co-star Chris Tucker.Or like Paul Walker whod completed his role as Collier in Brick Mansions prior to his death in a high-speed auto accident in November. Walker was best known for the The Fast and the Furious franchise; the producers of the upcoming seventh installment are using his two brothers and some digital sorcery to finish the picture and write Walkers character out of the series. Brick Mansions includes two different scenes of Walker crashing a car at high speed. Should the producers have removed these? I dont think so. The guy specialized in car-chase movies. Certainly they might have done a more tasteful job of the chintzy-looking onscreen dedication to Walker that pops up before the end credits.Walker replaces B13s Cyril Raffaelli who subsequently demonstrated his own parkour skills as a bad guy in Live Free or Die Hard (earning the epithet ""damn hamster"" from that yippie-kai-yayin quip machine John McClane) but has mostly stayed out of American pictures. Theres no getting around the fact that Raffaelli was a more convincing physical match for Belle because like Belle hes an athlete first -- his credits on IMDB as a stunt coordinator far outnumber his credits as an actor.Walker? He was an actor one blessed with more affability than range. His line readings arent much more persuasive than Belles who is working in his second language. Physically Walker keeps up well enough and the film gets a few laughs out of his disbelieving reaction shots whenever Belle performs some bravura gymnastic feat that Walkers character is supposed to emulate. At least he isnt playing second banana to Vin Diesel anymore the poor guy.1 Catalina Denis and David Belle.Photo by Philippe Bosse/Photo Philippe Bosse / Europacor - (c) (c) 2013 EUROPACORP - TRANSFILM INTERNATIONAL INC.

Brick Mansions was the last film the actor completed before his tragic death and its another variation on his usual type The Undercover Cop With Something to Prove Who Likes to Drive. The film may be set inside a massive housing complex but it still finds plenty of opportunities to get Walker behind the wheel where he always seemed most comfortable. Those scenes are meant to be fun exciting maybe even a little ironic but right now they just make you queasy and sad. That feeling one assumes will dissipate over the years. But the rest of Brick Mansions also feels like a miscalculation. As an American remake of the 2004 French film District B13 it should be wilder funnier nuttier. B13 was a dystopian crime thriller partly designed to showcase Parkour the act of swiftly and acrobatically moving through an urban environment using things like walls and windows and fire escapes and roofs and chimneys and whatnot as your playthings. That film co-starred one of Parkours founders David Belle who reprises his part in Brick Mansions as well playing Lino an ex-con and urban crusader who lives in the titular futuristic wasteland a blighted section of Detroit that has been blocked off from the rest of the city with a 40-foot wall. (The year is 2018 and the citys powers that be have abandoned the denizens of Brick Mansions to wallow in their own crime and filth.) In trying to rid the hood of drugs however Lino has crossed a local drug kingpin Tremaine Alexander (RZA) who kidnaps his girlfriend (Catalina Denis) in return. As it happens Tremaine has also acquired a neutron bomb and a small Russian missile and has pointed them at downtown Detroit. That brings cop Damien Collier (Walker) into the mix He wants to connect with Lino and use him to get into Brick Mansions and find his way to Tremaine. Its a ridiculous plot but a promising one; the French film had roughly the same premise. District B13 worked thanks to its creative freewheeling sense of fun. Parkour was a stunning combination of agility speed and gravity-defying elegance and the film wisely highlighted the fact that it was real not relying on superhero CGI or martial arts wire-fu. But Brick Mansions right from the get-go utilizes extremely quick cuts and high shutter speed trickery the kinds of effects filmmakers often use to artificially ratchet up action in their films. (Compare for yourselves Heres a clip from District B13 and heres a shorter clip of the same basic scene from Brick Mansions featuring the same actor.) The result drains the Parkour of both grace and novelty; it becomes just another stunt nothing more and nothing less. Theres precious little Parkour in this putative Parkour movie. Some elements work better than others. Belle Im afraid is a bit of a wash -- physically gifted yet hopelessly bland. But Walker is his reliable self as the street-tough white-bread cop. His grandfather lives in an actual mansion; that our hero came from money but chose the streets offers an intriguing bit of character shading. As the head villain RZA gets to play with an interesting contradiction as well He is the kind of over-the-top bad guy who will randomly shoot someone to make a point but he also gets to have his reasons with a seemingly endless supply of earnest often hilarious self-justifying lines. (On his men playing video games ""When theyre not out cappin niggas in the streets theyre in here cappin em on a TV screen. I give them jobs so they can feed their families."") If only the movie could have matched his flamboyance. But Brick Mansions is slow and confused when it should be fast and exuberant and what was a spirited inventive French action movie becomes a Hollywood-ized slog.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 25 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Apr. 28 2014 214PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Camille Delamare Written by Luc Besson Bibi Naceri Starring Paul Walker David Belle RZA Classification PG Year 2014 Country France/Canada Language English One of the last films from Paul Walker (The Fast and the Furious) who died last November in a car accident Brick Mansions is a remake of Luc Bessons 2004 French action movie District B13. Its set in a Detroit dystopia where a walled-off area of the city houses the citys worst criminals. In a set-piece overture sequence rule-bending undercover detective Damien Colliers (Walker) assignment is to infiltrate the area to take out gang kingpin Tremaine (rapper RZA) who is threatening to deploy a stolen neutron bomb. The detectives assigned sidekick is Mansions denizen and ex-con Lino played by David Belle one of the inventors of parkour the sport of urban object course running featured in the first film. Lino an anti-drug thorn in Tremaines side wants to rescue his girlfriend Lola (Catalina Denis) from Tremaines gangs especially sadistic lesbian dominatrix Rayzah (Ayisha Issa) though that description makes the movie sound more exciting than it is.While Belles acrobatic stunt work is still impressive a decade later Brick Mansions is a non-starter It chokes on its deja vu the hyperactive Mixmaster editing is exhausting and the characters banter is so leaden it might violate federal emission standards.

Ten years ago French action auteur Luc Besson produced and co-wrote a kicky thriller called ""District B13"" (later followed by ""District 13 Ultimatum""). Set slightly in the future it was a thugs-vs-cops movie in which who the ""good guys"" were often shifted. That kind of cinema cynicism wasnt new at the time (and has since become typical). What was fresh though was parkour -- a very basic very urban martial art in which star David Belle propelled himself down stairs through windows across roofs. That was exciting (and in an increasingly CGI-driven landscape very real) and it soon started showing up in Hollywood. And now the ""District"" films have made the jump too with ""Brick Mansions"" an American movie which takes (and tweaks) the plot from the French original while setting the whole thing in a ""RoboCop"" Detroit of walled-off slums and smirking corporate interests. There are a few other additions too. The late Paul Walker in his final finished role adds some marquee value playing yes yet another undercover cop who bonds a little too easily with the criminals; RZA is on hand too to add some street cred as the citys drug lord. Walker is no better or worse than he was in the many ""Fast amp; Furious"" films; RZA is clearly still a long way from that successful acting career hes long been eyeing. But whats best is whats unchanged -- the wonderfully graceful Belle back as the tough gang-busting local whos determined to save his crumbling ghetto home even if it means taking on an army of well-armored criminals barehanded. Barehanded but never defenseless as he leaps -- literally -- from one crisis to another often kicking someone senseless along the way. The new film cheats a little on the action sequences clearly speeding up the footage to make its star look even more graceful. (It also sounds at times as if its dubbed him to make him a little more understandable even as the film tries to explain away this unusual Motor City citizen as ""a French-Caribbean."") But hes still wonderful to watch even with the extra help a giddy adrenaline-drenched athlete wholl remind you of a slightly more serious but just-as-airborne Jackie Chan. The rest of the film isnt quite as much fun. RZAs drug lord is given some very silly henchmen (including Robert Maillet the grimacing giant from ""Sherlock Holmes""). And the script twists itself in pretzels trying to first establish RZA as a fearsome character and then turn him into some sort of civic supporter. But dont see it for RZA (or in hopes of seeing anything from Walker you never saw before). Or for the many bad supporting performances dull car chases or self-consciously kinky catfights between the Good Girl (in a short pleated skirt) and the Bad Girl (in a butch dominatrix outfit). See it for Belle. See it for the parkour. And for the wonderfully magical spectacle of a man flying. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and sexual material. Brick Mansions (PG-13) Relativity (95 min.) Directed by Camile Delamarre. With Paul Walker RZA David Belle.

Photo Credit AP / Philippe Bosse advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In a walled-off section of dystopian Detroit an undercover cop hunts a drug dealer. (Rated PG-13) BOTTOM LINE Thoroughly dopey but eye-popping parkour stuntwork and a charismatic RZA make it fairly enjoyable. The late Walker turns in one of his final performances. CAST Paul Walker RZA David Belle LENGTH 129 High on stuntwork and low on logic ""Brick Mansions"" is the kind of mindless action flick that works well enough on its own dopey terms. Its star is nominally Paul Walker the ""Fast and Furious"" actor who died in a car crash in November but its real selling point is a form of urban gymnastics known as parkour. Youve seen it briefly in movies like ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" and ""Casino Royale"" but ""Brick Mansions"" is the first major-studio project built entirely around this eye-catching gravity-defying style of movement. That means plot and character are secondary if that. Based on Luc Bessons ""District 13"" films and directed by Camille Delamarre the movie is named after a walled-off Detroit ghetto where undercover cop Damien Collier (Walker) is searching for drug kingpin Tremaine Alexander (RZA). Colliers reluctant partner is ex-con Lino (David Belle). A woman is involved (Catalina Denis plays Linos ex-girlfriend) but there are bigger problems Tremaine possesses a neutron bomb.

As an actor hes passable but as a physical artist hes special. Belle walks on ceilings bounces off walls and seems to climb into empty space.At his best he moves like a combination of Jackie Chan and Shaun White. The movies other show-stealer though in a different way is RZA who delivers several thug-life monologues with fiery charisma. Whenever ""Brick Mansions"" adopts the outraged stance of the 99 percent -- the downtrodden versus the power elite -- it falls to RZAs Tremaine to make it work and he does. The actor-rappers hip-hop bona fides help turn even marginal lines (""Where I come from cash rule everything around me"") into manifestoes. As for Walker he gets to do some mano-a-mano along with a little pedal-to-the-metal in a stolen Mustang. Hes one of several modest pleasures in ""Brick Mansions."" 204 EntertainmentBrick Mansions trailer _____ advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT In a walled-off section of dystopian Detroit an undercover cop hunts a drug dealer.

"Brick Mansions | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; brick-mansions ) Brick Mansions (Canada/France 2014) April 24 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli As cynical as it may sound its probably true that the death of actor Paul Walker gave life to Brick Mansions. A D-grade action flick with nothing to recommend it beyond a cacophony of mind-numbingly generic action sequences Brick Mansions can be marketed as the ""final completed film"" made by the late Walker. So instead of heading directly to video where it rightfully belongs the movie is getting a theatrical release. Not since Donald Pleasance exited Stage Right shortly after completing Halloween 6 has a notable actor suffered such an ignominious farewell. Walkers career it should be noted sputtered outside The Fast and Furious franchise. Although long expected to become a major player in the action arena he never matured into that role. Brick Mansions is an example of the kind of lesser fare he was forced to participate in to maintain a steady stream of work outside his outings with Vin Diesel. Fortunately Brick Mansions wont define his legacy. In fact when one speaks of Walkers life and career this film wont be mentioned which is as it should be for something this forgettable. The storyline doesnt startle with its originality sounding like a low-rent version of The Raid Redemption. Undercover cop Damien (Walker) partnered with escaped convict Lino (David Belle) is tasked with infiltrating Detroits infamous ""Brick Mansions"" housing development. While there he has to locate crime lord Tremaine (RZA) who is in possession of a neutron bomb. Unfortunately Tremaines tampering with the bomb has started a countdown to detonation. Damien has 10 hours to convince the bad guy to let him defuse it but theres an issue. Damien blames Tremaine for his fathers death and is interested in revenge. When done with flair and energy few things are more exciting than an action scene. However when executed with a pedestrian lack of verve action becomes repetitive and boring. The adrenaline junkie is more likely to go into withdrawal as a result of watching Brick Mansions than get a fix. The repeated car chases foot races shootouts and fist fights that form the latticework of the movies threadbare plot are devoid of tension or suspense. Theres no sense that any of the characters are in jeopardy. In fact using the term ""characters"" to describe the thinly-drawn and woodenly acted types is a stretch. A remake of the passable 2004 French film District B13 Brick Mansions contains all the action staples but they are assembled by director Camille Delamarre (making his feature debut) without any sense of style or intelligence and barely more than a nod to coherence. A neutron bomb? Are we supposed to take that seriously? In other circumstances Brick Mansions might have been a legitimate contender to enter the realm of movies described as ""so bad theyre good."" Unfortunately Walkers untimely demise casts a pall over the production especially when we see his character involved in high-speed car chases. The lingering sour taste makes Brick Mansions excruciating to endure. Theres no fun to be had here and if an action movie doesnt make the grade as escapist entertainment whats the point? If the filmmakers had really wanted to honor Walkers memory a better move might have been to bury Brick Mansions with him rather than letting this misfire see the light of day.

Photo AP MOVIE REVIEW Brick Mansions Running time 89 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity violence drug references). At the Empire the Magic Johnson the Lincoln Square others ""Brick Mansions"" is set in a fictional dystopian Detroit of 2018 or roughly 40 years after actual dystopia took over the real Detroit. ""Citys damn near broke"" moans the mayor. If only Dystopias supposed to be worse than whats in the papers fellas. Try to keep up. Blame the cluelessness on the French DNA of the film which is a remake of the Luc Besson-produced ""District B13"" a far sharper flick that made exciting use of parkour the art of scurrying up walls like a roach on Mountain Dew and jumping on bad guys necks like a malevolent scarf. The late Paul Walker plays an undercover cop sent to infiltrate the Brick Mansions a giant housing project set off from the rest of Detroit by a huge wall. (The conceit actually makes sense in France where projects ring cities like Paris that people dont want to leave -- but not in Detroit from which anyone with the means to do so already fled.) Theres a neutron bomb hanging around but if it went off would it really make that much of a difference? And why dont the evil developers just use the thousand-megaton power called ""eminent domain"" to tear down the slums? Instead of just sneaking the bomb in and setting it off though the politically connected villains put a handy timer on it and let it tick down while Walker a gang lord (RZA) and a crusading anti-drug resident (parkour superstar David Belle more stuntman than actor) chase each other around. You could think of the chases as the pearls in a necklace lazily strung together by a filament-thin story except in this case the pearls are more like gravel. Spastically directed by Bessons protege Camille Delamarre the film wastes Belles talents by frantically chopping up the action to make it look extra-artificial. Things look particularly strange when Walker and Belle are beefing but Delamarre has to keep cutting around to disguise Walkers stuntman. Why put Belle in the movie at all? Schlockmeister Besson who co-wrote the script throws in typical goofball Keystone Kops touches like having a villain ejected out of a speeding car and onto the floor of the police station.

TWITTER Paul Walker plays fast and furious in Luc Bessons U.S. remake of French urban ghetto action movie. Adept as ever at recycling old material writer-producer Luc Besson has transposed his 2004 hit District B13 from Paris to Detroit for an English-language version which featuring one of the last roles of action star Paul Walker should outperform the original. Walkers death in a car crash last November caused work on Fast amp; Furious 7 to be suspended but that has now resumed using body doubles and CGI although release is not scheduled until 2015. In the meantime fast and furious will serve to describe the action in the latest vehicle to roll off the Besson assembly line. Set in 2018 -- the original also had been set in a then-near future of 2006 -- and shot in Montreal this new version is credited to first-time director Camille Delamarre the editor on notable Besson productions such as Taken 2 Colombiana and Transporter-3 but has Bessons fingerprints all over it. Like District B13 Mansions is co-scripted by Besson (who wrote the original along with Bibi Naceri) and co-stars David Belle inventor of the training technique known as parkour which uses vaulting flipping swinging rolling and above all bodily momentum as a means of overcoming physical obstacles. STORY Paul Walkers Lost Movie Whats Next for the Late Actors Passion Project? Theres vaulting and flipping galore as well as the customary ration of fistfights shoot-outs car chases and general mayhem that should satisfy hardcore action fans and if the storyline doesnt really withstand close scrutiny that didnt prevent the French version from racking up ticket sales and thats just as likely to be so in English-speaking territories. Brick Mansions is the name given to a walled-off derelict precinct of the former Motor City that has become a no-go area a lawless zone inhabited entirely by hoods and criminals of various stripes. Undercover cop Damien Collier (Walker) fresh from breaking up a drug ring headed by George the Greek (Carlo Rota) is charged with infiltrating the Mansions to take on gangster kingpin Tremaine (RZA) who is threatening to launch a nuclear missile at the city center. He is given further motivation when Tremaine kidnaps his former girlfriend Lola (Catalina Denis) delivering her into the clutches of his leather-and-chain-clad female sidekick the sadistic Rayzah (Ayisha Issa). Damiens sole lead is a contact with the locally based ex-con Lino (Belle) whom he believes to be responsible for the killing of his father also a cop. STORY Vin Diesel Works With Paul Walkers Brothers To the Parents You Raised Some Great Kids The movie contributes nothing new to the genre but disbelief is suspended willingly enough once the action gets up speed. Among the set-piece fight scenes that stand out are one between Lola and Rayzah and another in which Damien and Lino take on a seven-foot hunk known as the Yeti (Robert Maillet). Theres the occasional suggestion of humor but generally the script best described as functional eschews wit or irony. Damien and Lino attempt some repartee in their exchanges but Butch and Sundance they aint. The nuclear blackmail and countdown with Tremaine demanding 30 million if he is to spare the city are given a nifty twist but the attempt at a social message -- the importance of communal values the cynicism of politicians -- rings hollow and adds nothing to the sum of human knowledge. But these considerations will not deter fans who will find plenty to please them in the stunts (by Michel Julienne) and choreography and in Marc Bells score which succeeds by being unobtrusive.

Relativity Media hide caption toggle caption Relativity Media Paul Walker stars in Brick Mansions. Relativity Media It is never not awkward to talk about a film after one of the stars has died. Thats perhaps never any more true than it is in the case of Brick Mansions one of the last films of Paul Walker. Walker died in November of last year after a career that included a lot of movies like this one silly hyper action thrillers that often included as this one does moments in which everybody in the theater chortled at their insane cartoonish brutality. There is no way to make there be anything elegiac about Brick Mansions or out of the experience of seeing it. To try to make it a celebration of life or to find in it any lessons whatsoever would be absurd and in its way disrespectful to the 50 percent serious (plus or minus one percent) way in which its made. Brick Mansions is a remake of the 2004 French film Banlieue 13 which you can find for rent in the United States as District B13 -- a film for which the dialogue is so relatively insignificant that they serve it up dubbed rather than subtitled. District B13 came from screenwriters Luc Besson and Bibi Naceri who also wrote Brick Mansions. Whats more the original and this remake share a star French actor and stunt coordinator David Belle one of the originators of Parkour a discipline that sends guys running through the streets flipping and climbing walls for the benefit of very often YouTube. In this version Belle plays Lino the honest man who happens to be the only person left who really cares about Brick Mansions a Detroit housing project thats been walled off by the police and left to rot. The place is run by Tremaine (RZA) who you know is the ringleader because at the police station it says ""RING LEADER"" next to his picture. Lino takes some of Tremaines drugs and destroys them Tremaine kidnaps Linos girlfriend and Lino teams up with cop Damien -- played by Paul Walker -- who also wants to bring down Tremaine and save the girl. Fighting ensues. Running ensues. Jumping ensues. Theres a bomb with a prominent readout. Back flips ensue. Bonking each other with props ensues. And at the end theres an intriguing little twist thats intended to inject a little social commentary. But mostly its a fighting movie. If youve always wondered why more guys dont beat each other with steering wheels this is your movie If youve always wondered how you could gruesomely kill someone from inside a cell this is your movie If youve always wondered how two smaller guys might defeat a huge guy this is your movie Theres a sort of good-natured goofiness to Brick Mansions and particularly to how ill-equipped Walker really is to keep pace with Belle (who himself may be ill-equipped to keep pace with himself from ten years ago). There are a couple of nice references to the fact that Linos way of navigating Fake Detroit is pretty intimidating even to a cop who earlier pulls off a rousingly entertaining unauthorized entry into a speeding car. Parkour is really fun to watch; thats why YouTube likes it. The guys who do it are crazily anti-gravitationally athletic and it doesnt need a lot of kinetic editing to look kinetic. It is kinetic already and in the original District B13 while theres still more editing than it probably needs the camera does sometimes pause long enough to watch Belle do his thing which is why the people are there. Of course that was 2004. We are now in 2014 and chaos cinema -- as a fine video essay by Matthias Stork called it -- is dominant. Post-Bourne post-Michael-Bay and yes post-six Fast-And-Furious movies action sequences are typically shot with such a manic camera that you can barely keep track of whats happening. When all youre missing out on is cars flipping and regular actors having a fight its one thing. But when youre missing out on David Belle doing Parkour its hugely frustrating because -- again -- its the best reason to see the movie. Furthermore Brick Mansions suffers from another weird tic of action directors and cinematographers which is that weird jumpy sticky effect that I have long recognized but only recently came to know by the apt name ""staccato shutter."" Its the camera effect Steven Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski used to get a sort of ultra-real look at the beginning of Saving Private Ryan and its also often associated with Gladiator. It creates stuttery-looking action scenes and Brick Mansions uses it a lot. Not only that but they use a more extreme version of it than I can remember seeing in the past so that youre getting a very disorienting shutter effect combined with the crazy-fast editing thats disorienting already. (You can see it in this clip. Spoiler alert theres punching.) And all of this has the effect of dampening the impact of what Belle is bringing to this movie thats legitimately different from what you get in most action movies. Its too bad though the movie still has some enjoyably over the top sequences and some funny moments between Walker and Belle. It feels like it was fun to make. It feels like despite being a remake it was made with some zazz and with at the least some desire that it be a hoot to watch. And it is a hoot to watch even if to be honest theres little reason for it to exist.

Brick Mansions Paul Walkers last film makes for a poor eulogy review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBrick Mansions Paul Walkers last film makes for a poor eulogy reviewBrick Mansions the late action star Paul Walkers last completed film opens Friday.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. April 24 2014Brick MansionsStarring Paul Walker David Belle RZA and Catalina Denis. Directed by Camille Delamarre. 90 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGBrick Mansions the remake of 2004 French film District 13 finishes with an in memoriam remembrance of leading man Paul Walker who appears here in his final completed work.Cartoonish and mediocre Brick Mansions isnt much of a eulogy for popular action star Walker who died in November when the speeding car he was riding in crashed on an L.A. street killing Walker and the driver.Article Continued BelowAt the time of his death Walker was midway through making his last movie in the franchise that made him famous Fast amp; Furious 7. Brothers Caleb Walker and Cody Walker will help finish the film due out in 2015. Brick Mansions is the last film Paul Walker completed before he was killed in a car crash.  (Philippe Bosse / The Associated Press)  As with Famp;F the chases in Brick Mansions are impressive although primarily on foot while the few scenes with Walker behind the wheel of a speeding muscle ride cant help but illicit unnerving feelings.District 13 was credited with helping bring the stunt-like and highly athletic moves of parkour to the big screen thanks to co-star David Belle who returns for Brick Mansions as Lino an ex-con turned community hero trying to protect the residents of the largely abandoned densely built highrise neighbourhood.Its now a walled city since the cops find they cant control the gangs and drug dealers running rampant within. Hardly a novel screen concept but it helps to give the Brick Mansions project a name and a sense of isolation from the suits downtown who want to exploit the people living there.As with the original the script is penned by French writers Bibi Naceri and The Fifth Elements Luc Besson and its hardly a work of finesse. The plot makes as many leaps in logic as the astonishingly athletic Belle does while bouncing off walls and careening off rooftops.But nobody is stopping by Brick Mansions for anything beyond the gravity-defying action showcased in an opening chase scene that sees Lino propel himself like a human slingshot.He reluctantly teams with Walkers Damien -- and the feeling is mutual -- an undercover cop dropped into the Brick Mansions to stop ruthless crime boss Tremaine (rapper-turned-actor RZA).Hes a drug kingpin with a fondness for quoting Bob Marley and blowing things up. Now hes got his hands on a neutron bomb and is using it to hold the city hostage. He ups the ante by kidnapping Linos sexy siren ex-girlfriend Lola (Catalina Denis).Damien and Lino find their initial distrust leads to bonding which spawns tandem stunts and fight scenes with random bad guys (one involving a steering wheel is impressive) although Walker cant help but appear sluggish compared to Belle.Director Camille Delamarre (Taken 2) relies heavily on camera trickery speeding up and slowing down as needed to highlight jumps and stunts but in between the action scenes tedium takes over. Brick Mansions charges to its conclusion with an absurd storming of city hall and a shocking personality reversal in a character that makes you wonder how much filmmakers can underestimate the intelligence of an audience.Were left with a sense that Walker deserved better and perhaps could have done better if there had been other movies with more challenging stories ahead for him. Brick Mansions leaves his legacy caught up in the same kind of movie hed been making for years.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsWhen and why Sophie Gregoire Trudeau accepts designer giftsFive fashion gifts given to Sophie Gregoire Trudeau have come to light recently with some people criticizing her acceptance of them though the items fall within Canadian conflict of interest guidelines.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review Brick Mansions collapses into incoherence - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Brick Mansions collapses into incoherence A scene from Brick Mansions Philippe Bosse / Europacor A scene from ""Brick Mansions."" A scene from ""Brick Mansions."" (Philippe Bosse / Europacor) Gary Goldstein ""Brick Mansions"" Paul Walkers penultimate film (prior to ""Fast amp; Furious 7"") is a dumb and ugly action picture that works strictly as a reminder of the late actors head-turning good looks and modest charisma. Otherwise this remake of the 2004 French thriller ""District B13"" directed by Camille Delamarre (editor of ""Transporter 3"" and ""Taken 2"") is a dizzying mishmash of showy stunts muddled narrative and some seriously risible acting and dialogue.Prolific filmmaker Luc Bessons screenplay faithfully adapted from the ""B13"" script he wrote with Bibi Naceri has relocated this dystopian crime tale from 2006 Paris to 2018 Detroit (as if the Motor City didnt have enough image problems). Its centered on a bleak government-quarantined housing project called Brick Mansions home to the citys most lawless criminals. The worst of the bunch ruthless drug kingpin Tremaine (rapper-actor-director RZA) whos in possession of an old Russian surface missile thats yknow poised for destruction.REVIEW More movie reviews from the Times Enter Damien Collier (Walker) an upright cop sent undercover to bring down Tremaine whom Collier believes murdered his policeman dad. But to infiltrate Brick Mansions Damien must pair up with its longtime resident Lino (David Belle reprising his role from ""B13"") a ""French Caribbean ex-pat"" (really?) ex-con and vigilante whose ex-girlfriend (Catalina Denis) Tremaine has kidnapped. The acrobatic Lino also conveniently sports killer combat skills which are put to eye-popping use here. (Belle co-founded Parkour a propulsive discipline that uses swift efficient body movements to conquer environmental obstacles.) Brick Mansions official trailer Official trailer for the film ""Brick Mansions."" Official trailer for the film ""Brick Mansions."" See more videos Evil henchmen (played by Gouchy Boy Robert Maillet and others) and one particularly nasty henchwoman (Ayisha Issa) dubious lawmen and shady politicians all get in Damien and Linos way as they fight race crash and trash their way around the city in pursuit of their own brand of justice. To see car accident victim Walker at the helm of so much vehicular mayhem is to say the least unsettling.The action sequences of ""Mansions"" are edited within an inch of their lives adding more incoherence than thrills. The film takes a ham-fisted stab at sociopolitical commentary via its twisty ending but that only serves to make the preceding mayhem and plotting even less plausible than they already seemed.

Its best movies--like Taken The Transporter and Lockout--manage to combine American snarl with Cantonese-flavored style. They are blatantly derivative Taken is Death Wish given pummeling momentum The Family dresses the Addams Family in mob-movie drag and Lockout--a flop which has developed a cult following on account of actually being pretty good--asks what would happen if Guy Pearce played Bruce Willis playing Snake Plissken in a French comic book. Besson who writes or co-writes a large chunk of EuropaCorps output is a serial copycat. Often he takes to plundering his own work. (Hey a man can only have so many unoriginal ideas before he starts repeating himself.) His weakest productions are attempts at repackaging past hits motivated by formula instead of fandom. His scale of quality doesnt run from least derivative to most but from lavish to slavish.On that scale Brick Mansions a remake of EuropaCorps French-language District B13 from 2004 falls somewhere in the middle. Ludicrous even by the studios standards the movie attempts to transplant the premise--a sort of reverse Assault On Precinct 13 but with a nuclear bomb and more parkour--and one of the stars of the original to the United States. Its a beat-for-beat remake of a movie whose plot was never meant to do anything except get characters to jump from rooftops made by a less confident director (Camille Delamarre one of the studios go-to editors) and set in a culture Besson has never been able to grasp. Its also a silly pile-up of exaggerated action cliches--and much of the time its pretty fun. Part of District B13s appeal lay in the fact that both of its lead roles were played by stuntmen who didnt look like action stars but could do what action stars couldnt on camera. Unable to compete with the original in terms of stuntwork Brick Mansions instead plays up the cartoony illogic. Its a movie where car chases end with bad guys crashing into a police station where crooks drive pick-ups with mounted machine guns in full view of the cops where a murderous drug lord can run for mayor as a reform candidate and where the climax consists of the heroes rescuing a damsel who is chained to a rocket Perils Of Pauline-style. Brick Mansions is set in the near future in a dystopian Detroit (in the movies is there any other kind?) where heroes Damien (the late Paul Walker) and Lino (Dustin Hoffman look-alike David Belle more or less reprising his role from the original) must race against the clock to disarm a nuclear bomb thats fallen into the hands of dapper cooking-obsessed kingpin Tremaine (RZA).   Its a classic mismatched buddy set-up Ones an undercover cop the others a Frenchman who inexplicably lives in a Detroit housing project and whose voice has very clearly been re-dubbed. To get the bomb from Tremaine Damien and Lino must leap through windows in slow-motion escape the cameras stuttery shutter angle and defeat three mini-boss-like henchmen who are named K2 Rayzah (who carries a razor) and Thyroid Gland. Thats the movie in a nutshell and anyone whose lizard brain doesnt light up at the prospect of seeing one of Wu-Tangs own ham it up in a game of live-action Donkey Kong should probably sit this one out. As with many of Bessons scripts theres an awful lot of race-baiting going on (its a movie about two white guys saving the ghetto by beating up lots and lots of black people) which the movie completely subverts in its closing stretch. The broad populism of Brick Mansions finale is unlikely to get anyone to think hard about what could be done to improve life in Americas blighted inner-city neighborhoods; instead it comes across as just another outsize cartoon cliche.

What story there is makes little sense. A disappointment.RZA and Paul Walker in a scene from ""Brick Mansions.""(Photo Relativity Media)Story HighlightsThe story is confusing and ridiculous.No matter; the plot such as it is simply ties the fight scenes together.Paul Walker is the best thing about the film but thats not much comfort.""Brick Mansions"" is a bad movie basically an aerobics class in search of an action-thriller plot notable only because its one of the last movies made by Paul Walker.Walker who died in a car crash in November is by far the best thing about the movie directed by Camille Delamarre. Its a remake of ""District B13"" the 2004 French film co-written by Luc Besson who serves as a producer and obvious guiding hand here. If nothing else its consistent -- consistently stupid with things like character development and story advancement never getting in the way of another parkour stunt.That said at least David Belle one of the creators of parkour which involves all manner of running and jumping and swinging from things is on hand as a co-star. Hes kind of like Buster Keaton with bones of unbreakable rubber seemingly literally bouncing off walls.So lets have a stab at what its about. Damien (Walker) is an undercover police detective in Detroit in 2018. Crime has gotten so bad that the city has erected a wall around Brick Mansions the seediest part of town. The wall keeps the bad guys in the good guys out and never the twain shall meet.Damien works undercover inside these walls bringing down criminals. Hes got a score to settle and hes methodically mowing his way through a crime ring until he gets to the top the elusive Tremaine (RZA) who Damien has been trying his whole career to bring down.Detroits mayor (Bruce Ramsay) who has just unveiled a plan to develop the chunk of land on which Brick Mansions sits sends Damien inside the walls on an urgent mission To find and disarm a bomb that Tremaine has in his possession.Damiens only contact is Lino (Belle) an ex-con who did time for killing a cop. Meanwhile Tremaine kidnaps Linos ex-girlfriend Lola (Catherine Denis) as part of a drug deal gone wrong.If its confusing dont worry It doesnt matter. Plot threads are just shaky branches on which to hang overburdened fight sequences. But the trouble there is that Delamarre films them in such a way as to render them incomprehensible. You get the gist that Belle is a gifted athlete but not much more.Walker has more charisma than the rest of the cast combined but hes not given much to work with beyond cop-movie cliches and once in a great while some self-deprecating humor which is an oasis in this desert of bland ideas.Walker was filming ""Fast amp; Furious 7"" when he died and production is said to have resumed. Perhaps it will serve as a better legacy than ""Brick Mansions."" It could hardly be worse.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

(AP Photo/Relativity Media Philippe Bosse) Share PhotoAdrenaline runs high in the entertaining action-heavy remake of the 2004 French film ""District B13."" Starring the late Paul Walker in one of his last roles ""Brick Mansions"" packs gunfights car chases acrobatic stunts and humor into one stylized package.In the urban ghetto of Detroit which has been surrounded by a containment wall narcotics officer Damien (Walker) goes undercover and teams with ex-con Lino (David Belle) to infiltrate a crew of criminals and defuse a confiscated bomb.Originally set for a February release the film comes five months after Walkers death in a car accident and it was a bit unsettling to see him running around in the future. But his love for action roles comes through clearly in this movie. From the detailed fight scenes to the subtle humor Walker was in his element. Hes as gutsy and charming as ever.Wu-Tang Clan rapper RZA plays crime lord Tremaine. As the ring leader of the slums RZA looks the part. But rarely do you believe a word he says when he attempts to be threatening. Theres too much hesitation and not enough conviction. Later Tremaine reveals redeeming qualities which RZA embodies with more believability.Theres an element of camp to this movie as well which allows those who arent the best actors -- Walker included -- to prompt a few laughs.""Brick Mansions"" was directed by newbie Camille Delamarre and written by Luc Besson who also wrote ""District B13."" Like the original ""Mansions"" is set in the near future although theres really nothing in the film that shows us were a few years ahead other than the ""2018"" that is flashed on the screen.The many fight sequences were choreographed using a technique called Parkour which was created by Belle also a star in the original film. Parkour incorporates vaulting flipping swinging rolling etc. to move through various obstacles in a scene. The action is frozen for a split second during many of these moves and extreme close-ups put us right in the action.At times the Parkour technique requires the ability to suspend disbelief especially when a character is jumping from one rooftop to another climbing brick walls or overpowering as many as four men at once.Focused on finding Tremaine who he believes killed his father Damiens motivation is rooted in revenge. Linos subplot revolves around his ex-girlfriend Lola. Tremaine has dragged her into the slums which she had worked hard to escape. But shes no damsel in distress.Lola can fight and handle a gun -- all while showing off quite a bit of leg in a waitress outfit that looks like a truncated schoolgirl uniform. At one point Lola and the main dame in Tremaines clique Rayzah (Ayisha Issa) who sports a tiny leather ensemble duke it out. Though its a cliched fantasy come to life its still a hot scene.At the heart of the film is the social commentary focusing on a community divided. Within Brick Mansions there is no school hospital or police station and those who live there are mostly minorities. Its made clear that the government could care less about the Brick folks as theyre said to contribute nothing to society.This is not a film that will shift anyones moral compass. But its worth it to see Walker in the last film he was able to complete.""Brick Mansions"" a Relativity Media release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""frenetic gunplay violence and action throughout language sexual menace and drug material."" Running time 89 minutes. Two stars out of four.MPAA rating definition for PG-13 Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.___Follow Jessica Herndon on Twitter at https//twitter.com/SomeKind 0 CommentsFAQS  | SupportCommenting Rules Be relevant respectful honest discreet and responsiblePlease enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//solidopinion.com/"">comments powered by Solidopinion.</a>-Archived CommentsBe relevant respectful honest discreet and responsible.

(Philippe Bosse) C- Brick Mansions Genre Action/Adventure; Starring RZA Paul Walker; Director Camille Delamarre; Release Date Wide 04/25/2014; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Relativity Media Posted May 9 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT You know those ridiculous action movies where a bad guy with say four large guns gets beaten up by a quick-witted good guy with absolutely zero guns? Theyve got nothing on Brick Mansions. A remake of 2004s Luc Besson-scripted Banlieue 13 the thriller is essentially a long string of adrenaline-soaked sequences where our heroes -- using the Gallic art of street gymnastics called parkour -- defeat entire crowds of heavily armed villains simply by flipping and jumping faster than speeding bullets. Theres a plot too but its a lot less interesting A narcotics cop (Paul Walker) grudgingly teams up with a DIY vigilante (David Belle) to take down a drug lord (RZA) in a dystopian Detroit where housing projects have become walled-off crime incubators thanks to the draconian mayor (Richard Zeman). Ready for more backflips yet? Directed by Camille Delamarre the movie has Bessons comic-realism fingerprints all over it Theres a smoking-hot supervillainess (Ayisha Issa) who wears a push-up bra to work a rogue Russian nuclear device that somehow made its way to southeast Michigan and a go-go-go efficiency to the story as though the script were just a few pages of scribbled quotes and stick-figure explosions. Its fun to watch at first. All that twirling and sliding is a nice change of pace from the usual seat-shaking pyrotechnics. And Walker in one of his final roles radiates the same golden-boy charisma that warmed the Fast amp; Furious series. But as the bar of realism lowers (of the approximately 1 quadrillion bullets fired in the movie only one manages to graze Walkers ear) so will your patience until youre half-tempted to try flipping your way out of the theater.

Area theaters. The film legacy of the late Paul Walker continues with ""Brick Mansions."" Much of this subpar actioner is jarringly shot and edited with a butcher knife but at least the ""Fast amp; Furious"" star -- who died at 40 in a car crash last November -- is more settled than in his previous posthumous release ""Hours."" Walker is Damien Collier a cops son in a near-future Detroit. The year is 2018 a ""why bother?"" kind of detail. Following in his late dads footsteps police detective Collier has integrity while everyone else is a sellout including Motor Citys sleazy mayor. The mayor wants to tear down the inner-city projects known as Brick Mansions to put up a luxury shopping center. The best way to do that? A bomb of course. Meanwhile Collier volunteers to go into the tough hood to get crime boss Tremaine (rapper RZA). A parkour-crazy punk named Lino (David Belle) who grew up in the concrete jungle joins Collier after Linos sexy girlfriend (Catalina Denis) is kidnapped by Tremaines gang. Collier then learns he has not one but two bombs to deal with. This comes from the hack pen of screenwriter Luc Besson -- who made it before in France as ""District 13."" Theres jerky attitude mixed in with the kinetic fights. To make things easy during the battles every villain is set apart with a certain shtick -- like a dominatrix girl or a tattoo-face thug. Parkour ace David Belle and Paul Walker in Brick Mansions (Philippe Bosse/Europacor) Paul Walker plays a cop in near-future Detroit in Brick Mansions. (Philippe Bosse/Europacor) RZA and Paul Walker star in Brick Mansions (Philippe Bosse/Europacor) The premise aint new though. Its as if Besson thought of an ""Escape From New York"" scenario then got distracted as he jotted ideas down on a napkin. The film is put together too choppily to appreciate the bounce-off-walls athleticism of parkour. Thats a shame since ""District 13"" star Belle is known as a founder of the sport. Walker goes through the run-jump-shoot paces with a practiced hero stance. Sometimes there are unintended messages. In real life Walker was wearing a seat belt when he died. In the movie Collier looks on disapprovingly after urging a reluctant Lino to buckle up before their car races off. That accidental echo makes ""Brick Mansions"" seem even more badly constructed.

Photo Philippe Bosse Relativity Media Brick Mansions review Paul Walker saves the day 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Brick Mansions Action. Starring Paul Walker and David Belle. Directed by Camille Delamarre. (PG-13. 90 minutes.) The wonderful thing about movies is that they seem to be able to stop time and the painful thing about them is they dont have that power not really. And so we watch ""Brick Mansions"" the last film completed by Paul Walker partly thinking about the fact that hes not there anymore that he died in November in a car accident. The movie itself makes that impossible to forget. There are cars all over the movie - car chases car crashes crazy driving a scene of Walker hanging from a speeding car and even a scene of Walker and another guy going 80 miles per hour when the brakes and the steering give out. Apart from that theres just the awkwardness of looking at someone onscreen and knowing more about him than he knows about himself. In a sense everyone who has ever made a movie invites that - the day when the future looks back and knows all - but usually the future is slower in coming and doesnt arrive so jarringly. But ""Brick Mansions"" itself is partly to blame too because it doesnt provide much in the way of distraction. Its just a bad movie (details to follow). Whats more its better today and for the next month or so than it will ever be again because a certain sympathetic awareness of Walker - an extra pleasure in his good-guy aura and his sly humor an extra appreciation of what is gone - is all this movie has got. Theres nothing else. More in Movies The German Doctor review Chilling postwar story Teenage review Love song to adolescence Next Goal Wins review American Samoa soccer documentary Walking With the Enemy review Holocaust in Hungary ""Brick Mansions"" is part of an otherwise good trend in recent action movies. Its a French American collaboration written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen the authors of ""Taken"" and ""Taken 2."" Perhaps demand has exceeded capacity at this point as the directors megaphone was entrusted to first-timer Camille Delamarre the editor on ""Taken 2."" He doesnt get much to work with Even stretching out every fight and every chase for as long as he can the movie still feels stretched at 90 minutes. Things start off silly and end up laughable and ridiculous. The setting is Detroit in 2018 in a blighted section of the city a housing complex known as Brick Mansions that the government has abandoned. There a ruthless drug kingpin Tremaine (Rza) provides most of the jobs and structure for the residents. How bad is he? Every so often hell kill somebody just to underline a conversational point. Meanwhile theres an acrobatic French ex-con (David Belle) on the scene too - there always is. He keeps stealing kilos of drugs and destroying them because he believes theyre poisoning the community. Paul Walker enters the picture as a cop on a special assignment - an assignment so preposterous that I almost wish I could tell you this in person rather than write it The mayor asks him to find and disarm a stolen neutron bomb. You know neutron bombs? They were all the rage circa 1980. Its a nuclear device that kills people but leaves buildings intact. So what we get in ""Brick Mansions"" is the story of a cop teaming up with an acrobatic French antidrug ex-con to disarm a bomb while also trying to rescue the acrobats girlfriend from the drug lord. Along the way Walker and Belle are shown getting into two gratuitous fights (with each other) and theres at least one long chase that goes nowhere. Anything to pass the time. Unlike the ""Taken"" movies ""Brick Mansions"" gives us no clear villain - it keeps changing villains on us - while providing no absolute definite goal for the hero. Instead the goals are diffused between two heroes. The cop has his bomb. The ex-con has his girlfriend. Neither the bomb nor the girlfriend carries much emotional weight. But it gets worse. Faced with a story that doesnt make much sense the filmmakers switch gears and try for a sociological statement - something about the marginalized and the neglected. This makes for a funny last five minutes but sad too because Walker was better than this even if his movies sometimes werent. Lets hope ""Fast amp; Furious 7"" which he was filming when he died makes for a better goodbye. It opens early next year. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Brick Mansions Review Paul Walker Stars in District B13 Remake | Variety Variety Continue to Variety () Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Brick Mansions Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr April 24 2014 | 0249AM PT Paul Walker gives one of his final screen performances in this highly faithful propulsively exciting remake of District B13. Given that it not only covers the same narrative ground as the hyperkinetic 2004 French actioner ""District B13"" but even borrows one of that films stars -- the amazingly nimble frequently shirtless parkour artist David Belle -- theres no denying that ""Brick Mansions"" qualifies as one of the more redundant English-language remakes on record. Which in no way makes it an unnecessary or unenjoyable one Ten years on this second stab at the same material from Luc Bessons EuropaCorp generates nearly as much propulsive excitement as its predecessor and considering how few saw ""District B13"" Stateside (where it grossed only 1.2 million theatrically) theres clearly a sizable American audience ready to thrill to all those glass-smashing stairwell-hopping stunts. Still the chief draw and talking point for this quick-and-dirty Relativity release will surely be Paul Walker seen here in the last role he completed filming before his death in November. Its impossible not to watch ""Brick Mansions"" through the prism of that untimely event and if theres any novelty to be found in Bessons rehashed tale of slimy politicos and disenfranchised thugs working out their issues on an urban-ghetto obstacle course its in the thrilling haunting sight of Walker temporarily restored to his action-star prime. Whether hes clinging to the back of a speeding vehicle (an image that induces a chill) executing a perfectly timed backflip or fending off a bunch of uglies with his wrist cuffed to a steering wheel the actor appears to have sunk his teeth into a role whose extreme physical demands required him to up his game even beyond the already daunting standards of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. We are no longer in a dystopian Paris but rather a grimly futuristic vision of Detroit -- clearly the go-to urban wasteland of the moment (if movies as different as ""RoboCop"" and ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" are any indication) even though this particular version of the Motor City was filmed in Canada. Walker plays Damien Collier an undercover narcotics cop trying to avenge his fathers death at the hands of Tremaine (RZA) the imposing crime lord who rules over the run-down government-condemned public-housing projects known as Brick Mansions. But to reach his target Damien will have to join forces with Lino (Belle) an ultra-skilled highly principled fighter who grew up in Brick Mansions knows the whole squalid labyrinth by heart and has his own personal score to settle with Tremaine The drug lord has kidnapped Linos ex-girlfriend Lola (Catalina Denis) and made her the personal plaything of his majorly depraved blade-wielding henchwoman Rayzah (a seriously scary Ayisha Issa). The location and some of the characters may be new but the narrative template here is almost identical to the one in ""District B13"" -- starting with an opening chase sequence that culminates in a giddily pleasurable display of Linos parkour prowess (Belle is one of the co-founders of that urban movement) as he leaps from open windows clambers up and down fire escapes and sails blithely over the heads of his armed-and-dangerous pursuers always landing on his feet. Once again Belles character will find himself locked up by a corrupt cop (who doesnt live long enough to regret the decision) only to get busted out of jail by Damien with whom he develops a wary rapport. And once again the two men must outwit their shared nemesis and disable a neutron bomb that if detonated could wipe out millions of civilians. Insofar as the plot is little more than a thin but reasonably sturdy pretext for one slammin setpiece after another all this wholesale recycling scarcely matters. What counts here is not the originality of the storytelling but rather the beauty of the human body in motion and the interplay between a clever resourceful fighter and his or her physical environment -- which is to say the skill and ingenuity of the director. Whereas ""District B13"" marked the helming debut of Pierre Morel who went on to direct 2008s Liam Neeson-starring smash ""Taken"" ""Brick Mansions"" launches the feature-filmmaking career of editor Camille Delamarre another Gallic talent from inside the EuropaCorp fold (his editing credits include ""Taken 2"" and ""Transporter 3"" and hes already slated to direct ""Transporter 4""). Delamarre knows his way around an action scene and keeps the proceedings moving briskly enough even if the picture clocks in at about 10 minutes longer than its taut 81-minute predecessor. Still its hard not to wish that editors Carlo Rizzo and Arthur Tarnowski hadnt deployed such an aggressive cutting technique (especially in the parkour sequences) or that the film had played less frenetically with speed and slow motion the better for us to appreciate the real-time agility of the stuntwork (coordinated by Alexandre Cadieux) and the swift balletic movements of the actors. Whats onscreen is still plenty arresting sometimes electrifying. Its enriched too by the slow-building rapport between Walkers Damien and Belles Lino as they gradually get past their mutual distrust adjust to each others unique fighting methods and eventually learn to work in fiercely effective tandem. (One highlight involving two colliding vehicles and some carefully synchronized acrobatics is at once ludicrous and perfect.) They make a fine duo and while Belles performance is marred somewhat by his difficulty with English Walker seems fully in his element -- exuding his usual brash confidence to be sure but also allowing a gentle unforced humanity and self-deprecating humor to peek through at key moments. RZA offers solid backup in a role that becomes markedly less coherent over time suddenly morphing from ruthless kingpin to underclass hero as the film becomes an ill-advised tract on the dangers of walling off the haves from the have-nots; these sociopolitical points like the tragic backstory Damien is saddled with are pushed a bit too hard to convince. Trevor Morris score sets a furious beat for the action always unfolding in fittingly dreary urban environs expertly crafted by production designer Jean A. Carriere.
