Sending up the empty machismo and pointless scaremongering of reality TV shows like Cops the film centres on the rag-bag workforce of the Reno Sheriffs Department and the mayhem that ensues when they are invited to a police convention in Miami. An episodic narrative is used as an excuse to string together lots of mini set-pieces including the teams attempts at removing a dead Sperm Whale from a topless beach a police chase in golf carts and a lengthy paean to masturbating with the curtains open. As with Christopher Guests films its when the characters are aware of the cameras presence that the funnies slowly begin to emerge but in this case its from amid a comic debris of gay stereotypes scatological absurdism and - the Hollywood comedy accessory du jour - a prosthetically-enhanced rump.Instead of using this jump to the big screen to potentially spread the Reno 911 brand to a wider audience theres the impression that the makers have chosen to play to the gallery and merely up the levels of swearing and nudity. The trashy production values and a general air of shabbiness in both performance and dialogue give it the feel of a community theatre project thats accidentally spilled onto the streets. Hopefully the film will be put to good application as a cautionary tale for those writers who have neglected the fact that sitcoms run at 30 minutes with very good reason.

With this feature-length version of their COPS parody director Robert Ben Garant and his co-conspirators can now share that renown. Reno 911 Miami is not unfunny The characters are perfectly evolved screwups and the premise (every legit cop is quarantined at a police convention leaving our heroes in charge of Miami) has potential. It lacks only the discipline of a 30-minute episode -- or a YouTube video.

Fox has reaped nifty little paydays from risque comedies but the minimal effort expended on this barely-feature-length version of Comedy Centrals ""Reno 911"" exposes the exercise for what it is -- namely an opening-weekend pit stop en route to the inevitable unrated DVD release which will likely do reasonably well. Running a mere 80 minutes and somehow still feeling heavily padded this ""Cops"" spoof yields a few amusing (if widely spaced) moments but otherwise simply revels in the gratuitous nudity language and below-the-belt gags that an ""R"" rating provides. With the series in its fifth season -- chronicling in deadpan mock cinema verite-style the crime-fighting efforts of Renos police force -- the producers obviously felt the movie needed a splashier stage even if the biggest little city in the world is amusingly described near the outset as ""like Mayberry except everyones on crystal meth and prostitutions legal."" So writer-stars Robert Ben Garant (who also directed) Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney-Silver came up with the flimsy excuse of shipping Renos eight sheriffs to a police convention in Miami only to have a crisis leave them the only cops available to patrol the streets. Following a setup that showcases the group partying in Florida -- which includes not only a mass-masturbation scene but a depth charge consisting of tequila and Pepto-Bismol -- the movie then devolves into an extra-long episode of the TV program. Capitalizing on the venue the cops encounter an alligator in a swimming pool (funny) trouble at a topless beach (obvious) and a weed whacker-wielding mobster (Paul Rudd in one of many celebrities making cameos among them producer Danny DeVito) that parodies the Al Pacino version of ""Scarface."" That virtually all the jokes prove sophomoric is to be expected whether they dwell on the sexuality of Lt. Jim Dangle (Lennon) he of the skin-tight shorts; the ample bosom of Deputy Clementine (Wendi McLendon-Covey) sporting a mysterious tattoo; or Deputy Trudy (Kenney-Silver) pining for Dangle and seeking to learn how to be hip from Deputy Raineesha (Niecy Nash) who patrols the local beaches in a thong. Like any improvised comedy though theres a rarely-hit-and-mostly-miss element to the goings-on. Its telling that the obligatory closing-credit sequence displaying additional footage (not outtakes) isnt any better suggesting there was hardly a glut of laugh-out-loud gems left on the cutting-room floor. All of which goes to demonstrate that while its easy enough to slap a colon on a lowbrow cable TV show additional punctuation by itself isnt sufficient to actually transform it into a movie.

Starring Thomas Lennon Robert Ben Garant Niecy Nash and Mary Birdsong. Directed by Garant. (R. 84 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Police Academy"" is the box-office equivalent of voting for Richard Nixon. Nobody wants to admit they enjoyed the 1984 comedy but somehow it made enough money to spawn six sequels a television series and at least one pinball machine. ""Reno 911 Miami"" is maybe 12 IQ points smarter than ""Police Academy"" but it delivers the same thing lots of exaggerated sight gags pathetic yet likable characters and jokes that you wont be repeating in the office -- unless youre looking to get sued for sexual harassment. If you can relax enough to laugh at the idea of Diddys yacht getting splattered by an exploding sperm whale then youll get your 10 worth out of this film. The most difficult thing to overcome is paying full price for a movie that looks so cheap. The Comedy Central TV show is already super low budget -- ""Reno 911"" is basically a spoof of ""Cops"" -- and the feature film doesnt look any more polished. When Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson shows up in a funny unbilled cameo the presence of an A-lister on the set is a little jarring. Johnsons expense account for exfoliating facial scrub on the set of ""The Scorpion King"" was probably bigger than the entire travel budget for ""Reno 911 Miami."" Lt. Jim Dangle (Thomas Lennon who co-wrote the movie) leads the force of misfits many of whom appeared on the short-lived 1990s sketch show ""The State."" Lennon and writer-director Robert Ben Garant who plays a deputy make it easy on viewers whove never seen ""Reno 911"" introducing each of the characters on their home turf. Reno ""is just like Mayberry on the TV"" one cop deadpans in the documentary-style footage. ""Except everybodys on crystal meth and prostitutions legal."" Soon theyre off to a police conference in Miami where a hotel quarantine leaves the clueless deputies in charge of the citys law enforcement. Its best not to think too hard about that one. In fact enjoyment of ""Reno 911 Miami"" is almost completely dependent upon your ability to shut down both your reasoning skills and sense of taste. I laughed constantly during this movie -- but consider that this is coming from a guy who gave ""Soul Plane"" a positive review. What sets ""Reno 911 Miami"" apart from much less satisfying dumb comedies (from ""Van Wilder 2"" to ""Scary Movie 3"") is the writing. The humor is lowbrow but the screenwriters and performers have a sense of pride that makes them strive for stupid jokes that havent been done before. While the plot of ""Reno"" is an unoriginal hodgepodge of ""Police Academy 5 Assignment Miami Beach"" and ""Police Academy 6 City Under Siege"" many of the individual bits are very inspired. A scene in which the deputies deal with an alligator in a swimming pool could have been lame but its funny on three or four different levels -- mostly because the actors have good timing and dont get in each others way. As with most sketch comedy that gets turned into a feature film ""Reno 911 Miami"" runs well under an hour and a half yet it still feels like its 20 minutes too long. First to go should have been Paul Rudds bad Al Pacino ""Scarface"" imitation which wouldnt have made it past the dress rehearsal on ""Saturday Night Live"" or even ""Studio 60."" And while the characters are funny in ""Reno 911 Miami"" they really could use a straight man or at least someone who isnt totally incompetent. There are plenty of Bob Goldthwaits in the cast but no Steve Guttenberg. -- Advisory This film contains sex drug use profanity and the unnecessary use of force against criminal suspects several civilians and a small chicken.

"Reno 911 mocks everything from Cops to Baywatch - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Reno 911 mocks everything from Cops to Baywatch By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  February 23 2007 The cops on Comedy Centrals shameless improv-based ""Reno 911"" are certainly stupid in their local jurisdiction. But ""Reno 911 Miami"" confirms that theyd be unsafe in any city -- and funny too. The film is just a series of sketches crudely stapled at the last minute to a plot. But the outlandishness is still as amusing as it is on TV.""Miami"" brings to Florida the eight dim officers of the shows Reno sheriffs department an unflappable troupe of whites blacks gays and a Hispanic. The occasion is a national law enforcement convention and theyre barely in town a day when the citys 2000 police officers are quarantined in an absurd bio terrorism episode leaving it to the Reno gang to patrol the streets coloring every distress call with their own situational incompetence.A documentary film crew is on hand to record every gaffe -- the beached whale they blow up the gator-bit corpse they leave in a swimming pool. But really like the more conceptually audacious ""Borat"" the format is a conceit that justifies the movies visual limitations. It also allows ""Reno"" the movie (like the TV show) to send up the action on ""Cops.""The crimes both petty and major are fine. But the funniest thing about ""Miami"" is the hormones raging among this octet. Officer Williams (Niecy Nash) wants Deputy Jones (Cedric Yarb rough ) who wants Officer Clementine Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey ) who actually wants him too. Deputies Garcia (Carlos Alazraqui ) and Junior (Robert Ben Garant ) want whatever women will have them. And poor Lieutenant Dangle (Thomas Lennon ) in his tragic after-hours denim cutoffs (the pockets droop below the fraying hemline) cant find a man and has to fend off the desperate advances of Officer Wiegel (Kerry Kenney-Silver) who seems too dense to care that Dangle is gay.All this lust culminates in a nicely observed long take in which all eight try to score at their fleabag motel before bed. Its like an extremely sexually frustrated episode of ""The Real World"" or ""Melrose Place.""The Miami beachfront offers a chance to mock Hollywood blockbusters as well as ""Baywatch."" Officer Williamss stupendously buxom figure for instance sets a new museum-quality standard for proudly pear-shaped women. It helps to imagine that Claes Oldenburg made the pear.Whats refreshing about both the movie and the series is how the women in the cast are meaningfully in on the jokes. Kenney-Silver wrote ""Miami"" with Lennon and Garant who also directed. (They were members of the old sketch-comedy outfit ""The State"" which was on MTV for a couple of years in the early 1990s.)The storyline they dream up strains to redeem these cops in the eyes of their contemptuous peers. (It doesnt work .) Still to that end theres a plot to be foiled involving the Cuban drug lord (Paul Rudd) who has the bio terrorism antidote and on one occasion tortures a victim with a Weed Whacker.This low-rent nonsense cop business filled me with a nostalgic twinge. I didnt know I wanted the ""Police Academy"" series resurrected with a lot more hilarity but Im glad somebody did it.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; reno-911-miami ) Reno 911 Miami (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Reno 911 Miami represents an argument against taking 22-minute TV comedy shows and expanding them to 80-minute feature films. Something that entertains over a short period when watched from the vantage point of a couch or a recliner does not necessarily offer a comparably enjoyable experience when expanded and lengthened. It can be done - see South Park and Monty Python for counter-examples - but those are not the norms. As a TV show Reno 911 is diverting and amusing; as a motion picture its overlong and wears out its welcome. The film offers some solid laughs but not enough to justify sitting through 80 minutes of the faux cops antics. Devotees of the TV show however will probably not be disappointed. The same creative team is in place and the TV actors all make the jump to the big screen. Although the COPS mockumentary approach has been abandoned theres still the sense that a camera is trailing the characters because of the number of hand-held shots (this voyeuristic style leads to one of the movies biggest laughs). The R rating has allowed Reno 911 Miami to get lewd crude and nude. The profanity flows freely and one sequence involving the removal of a dead beached whale takes place on a topless beach. Also as with the TV show a lot of the dialogue is undoubtedly improvised. The thin premise underlying the movie is that the Reno 911 Cops - Lt. Jim Dangle (Thomas Lennon) Deputy Travis Junior (Robert Ben Garant) Deputy Raineesha Williams (Niecy Nash) Deputy Cherisha Kimball (Mary Birdsong) Deputy Trudy Wiegel (Kerri Kenny-Silver) Deputy Clementine Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey) Deputy James Garcia (Carlos Alazraqui) and Deputy S. Jones (Cedric Yarborough) - travel to a Law Enforcement Convention in Miami. When a bioterrorist attack traps all the other cops inside the convention center its up to the incompetent eight to fight crime on the streets and beaches of Miami. In addition to dealing with the aforementioned beached whale they must cope with a Scarface-like bad guy (Paul Rudd) handle an alligator in a backyard pool and figure out whose portrait is tattooed on Deputy Johnsons breast. The popularity of the television series (which averages nearly one million viewers for each new episode) has allowed the filmmakers to pull in a few well-known faces for cameos. Paul Rudd does his best bad Al Pacino impersonation. Danny DeVito and Paul Reubens show their faces. And most memorably The Rock strides into the middle of the movie lampooning a badass super-cop. The bulk of the screen time however belongs to the primary cast members of the show who flawlessly re-create their small screen alter egos. These actors have worked together for a long time many of them having appeared on the MTV sketch comedy show The State in the mid-1990s nearly a decade before starting Reno 911 on Comedy Central. Theyre comfortable with each other and it shows. When a joke in Reno 911 Miami works its usually hilarious and a lot of the funniest moments are on the gross and/or crude side (what some have termed as ""college humor""). The problem is that the ratio of successful jokes to running length isnt very good (about one per 10 minutes) and there are a lot of duds strewn along the way. Theres something dispiriting about watching a comedy where there are many more misses than hits; maybe its a result of expecting too much. Even taking into account the subjective nature of comedy its clear that the Reno 911 format cannot offer the same kind of viewing experience when bloated for movie theaters. Its limitations and weaknesses are magnified while its strengths are diminished. Reno 911 Miami is recommended only for die-hard fans of the TV show. Others are advised to wait until this is available in a smaller format.

"Small-Screen Cops Outside the Box washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Small-Screen Cops Outside the Box Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Dan Zak Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 23 2007 Its an American pastime to watch the law pursue the hapless toothless or pantsless. ""Cops"" knows this. The Comedy Central show ""Reno 911"" knows this too and its married this compulsion with our tendency to be amused by clueless policemen from Keystone Kops to ""Police Academy."" Cop chases perp. Camera chases cop. We laugh and laugh. ""Reno 911"" a savvy and hilarious parody of ""Cops"" is the show that lets us laugh at this tendency to laugh. Now its a feature-length movie that aspires to do the same -- to bowl us over with scofflaws in denim shorts gap-toothed prostitutes and the boneheaded officers who arrest and/or sleep with them. Moviedom is littered with the wreckage of ill-conceived small-to-big-screen adaptations but ""Reno 911 Miami"" is not the disaster it couldve been. Fans of the TV show need not shudder. You will not see sacrilege. You will see the four-season series boiled down to its essence and molded into an 84-minute CliffsNotes version for theatrical consumption. The degree to which the movie stands on its own is due to the shows three creators who ""wrote"" the screenplay for this heavily improvised movie Thomas Lennon (playing Lt. Jim Dangle of the breathtakingly short shorts) Robert Ben Garant (who directs and plays the mustachioed Kevlar-vested Deputy Travis Junior) and Kerri Kenney-Silver (playing the dowdy tactless borderline sociopath Deputy Trudy Wiegel one of the great characters of 21st-century television). The trio takes the Reno Sheriffs Department out of Nevada and plops it in Miami for a law enforcement convention where the Reno deputies -- incapable of doing their jobs in a smart clean fashion -- are fish out of water next to the dapper disciplined squads from other cities. When a bioterrorist event traps all the visiting officers in one building the Reno deputies are contracted to keep an eye on the rest of the city which is plagued with the hapless toothless or pantsless. This conceit allows the film to ease into the pacing and routine of the half-hour sketch comedy format if only for its middle third. Cop chases perp. Camera chases cop. And so on. Compared with the series yes its a compromise. ""Reno 911 Miami"" cribs some bits from the show at one point rehashing line for line a scene from the very first episode. But serial television remains the better medium for this particular work. A single film provides less opportunity to get to know the characters whose tics prejudices and inanities require more than 84 minutes divided among eight talented actors who must ration their face time to keep the movie rolling. And since its got to move like a movie we need a true villain. Paul Rudd gamely plays a Tony Montana-type sleazeball but trails with him the insistence of plot which dampens the easy-breezy improv that defines the TV show. Also making welcome cameos are character actors from the TV shows bullpen of guest stars (Patton Oswalt as a sniveling city official Nick Swardson reprising his role as the roller-skating man-floozy Terry). Though shes often sidelined in the movie its good to see Trudy Wiegel a character limned over four seasons into a portrait of womanhood gone terribly wrong. This is the deputy least qualified to carry a firearm which makes her the most lovable. Shes a perfect foil to the preoccupied Dangle and to decency in general. The one jarring problem -- and hear me out Im not a prude -- is the nudity and the cussing and the movie has plenty. The TV show does too but on Comedy Central there are censoring black bars struggling to keep pace with jiggling body parts and bleeps to cover the curse words. Theres a certain tacky innocence to bleeping; its endearing and vulgar at once. ""[Bleep] you"" is always funnier than the actual command. Without them it feels a bit like the filmmakers are hoping the bald gratuity attracts the ""Wedding Crashers"" contingent. ""Reno 911 Miami"" will suffice for fans who are hungry for new material. For those whove never seen the show but wouldnt mind a little transplanted Nevadan vulgarity sample the movie and consider catching the series on DVD where the perp-chasing trigger-happy tomfoolery has over 1000 minutes to blare its sirens. Reno 911 Miami (84 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sexual content nudity crude humor profanity and scenes of drug use.
