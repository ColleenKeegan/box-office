Which comes in handy since this ridiculous violent occasionally fun arse-end-of-summer action flick doesnt throw much character depth his way. Its based on the Hitman video game series - and the flummoxing plot might have been written by a couple of stoners after a late-night gaming session. Friend is shaven-headed Agent 47 the product of a 1960s experiment to bio-engineer emotion-free killers with heightened intelligence strength and judging from the film shocking taste in estate-agent suits. The whole thing feels cobbled together from bits of other action movies globetrotting from Berlin to Singapore with an oligarch baddie who wants to use the technology that created 47 for world domination naturally. With just 48 hours to eliminate his target Agent 47 - identifiable by the barcode on the back of his neck - zeroes in on a mysterious young woman (Hannah Ware). Shes meant to be the badass female hero here but does it count when theres a naffly gratuitous shower scene? At the end the door is left open for a sequel but Agent 47 doesnt feel like a character whos got what it takes to be a franchise hero - he and the film are lacking in personality.

"Hitman Agent 47 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hitman-agent-47 ) Hitman Agent 47 (United States/Germany 2015) August 21 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Hitman Agent 47 is an adaptation of a popular video game. Its also a reboot of a 2007 film. One might reasonably ask what this production does that wasnt accomplished in either of its other incarnations. The answer is nothing. But thats never stopped the movie industry from moving ahead with a title if theres a whiff of money to be scented. Hitman Agent 47 is typical of what we get in late August when the dog days have set in forgettable motion pictures that are more interested in providing brief distractions than full-bodied experiences. The film brought to the screen by Polish director Aleksander Bach (making his feature debut) is little more than a string of action sequences. The narrative which borders on incoherent is advanced through short bits of dialogue. Attempts at character development fall somewhere between laughable and nonexistent. Hitman Agent 47 feels more like a highlight reel than a complete motion picture. Only a bare minimum of non-action scenes were included in the final cut. Theres enough here to piece together a rudimentary storyline but the details are often either confusing or nonsensical.  Theres also a moment when a character is shot in the back but apparently suffers no ill effects. Either I missed something or the filmmakers did. Its possible to craft an all-action film that grips audiences.  Recent examples include The Raid and Mad Max Fury Road. Hitman Agent 47 is missing a key ingredient however. It lacks a discernable pulse. The action sequences although assembled with workmanlike efficiency dont offer anything special. Good action films succeed because the shoot-outs fights and chases are suffused with suspense. The characters in Hitman Agent 47 so thinly drawn that we never care much about them and without that factor an action scene is little more than a representation of stunt work and special effects - a ballet of violence signifying nothing. Action scenes should elevate the heart rate but the absence of intensity in Hitman Agent 47 keeps the adrenaline at normal levels. Hitman Agent 47 opens with a lengthy voiceover providing background about the global situation. The main story involves the titular character played with steely determination by Rupert Friend traveling with a young woman named Katia (Hannah Ware) to find her dying father. Hes reclusive genius Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds) the man responsible for the ""Agent"" program that gave 47 his super-strength and durability.  They are pursued by an enemy asset ""John Smith"" (Zachary Quinto) and a small army of men who provide target practice for 47. The movie offers a series of twists to keep things from becoming too predictable. In fact the first 20 minutes (or so) work as an homage to The Terminator with the seemingly indestructible 47 carving a swath of death and destruction to get to Katia and John. Things change however when the truth about the characters motivations are revealed. Of course all is not as it seems. This leads to a lot of shooting and fighting. None of the action sequences stand out. In retrospect they blur into one extended canvas of carnage. Hitman Agent 47 bears little resemblance to the 2007 title Hitman (although both were written by Skip Woods). Its intended as a reboot rather than a sequel. The earlier film was significantly better - one of the more impressive video game movies to have been produced. It invested time and effort into character development rather than relying on a string of generic action sequences to keep things moving. Its unfortunate to see the new version backslide into the morass of subpar genre efforts. Hitman Agent 47 might offer a passable diversion for action junkies but for everyone else its best avoided.

CALUM MARSH Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 21 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 21 2015 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Aleksander Bach Written by Skip Woods Michael Finch Starring Rupert Friend Zachary Quinto Hannah Ware Country USA Language English Katia (Hannah Ware) perfect skin slick and gleaming wades topless into the rooftop pool of Singapores opulent Park Royal hotel its water cobalt against the night sky. The next morning a band of freelance assassins will muscle their way into her hotel room silenced pistols drawn occasioning a bit of frenzied hand-to-hand combat - an action scene to invigorate the proceedings. But for now in this moment of poolside repose we are treated to a rarer luxury pointless beauty. Hitman Agent 47 is a 30-million reboot of a much-maligned adaptation of a mildly popular video game franchise. What business does it have being sumptuous? Perhaps more saliently why are other blockbusters not? The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way Hitman boasts some of the most exquisite urban landscape photography Ive seen in a studio film Metropolitan skylines radiant in the predawn aerial views of high rises and motorways that could be ads by the local tourism board. The film features Ware alongside Zachary Quinto and Rupert Friend but the stars are plainly behind the lens. Who to praise? The cinematographer Ottar Gudnason? Or second unit DP Duane Manwiller who worked on Blackhat and Miami Vice? (Theres a great deal of Michael Mann in the films luminous digital vistas.) Compliments too are in order for Simon Daniel the location manager. Scarcely have Berlin and Singapore been put to such interesting use by an international production.Unfortunately this taste for extravagance and originality does not extend to the pen. Skip Woods and Michael Finch the screenwriters plunder the genre for cliche assembling - with the effort of what I imagine was a solid afternoon - the movies familiar spy-thriller frame. There are genetically engineered superhitmen of which Agent 47 (Friend) is an ambiguously malevolent exemplar an organization that oversees them and a competing faction that aspires to either destroy the superhitmen or replicate an army of their own (I was never quite clear which). Allegiances change frequently and confusingly. Many henchmen are indifferently dispatched. Meanwhile as the dull machinations continue director Aleksander Bach and his team of craftsmen blissfully trick out the surface.Splendour isnt a quality youd expect of a Hitman movie. But heres a stealth stroll through the hypermodern Changi International Airport that cites Le Samourai of all things and theres a secret meeting on the walkway of the Supertree Grove in Singapore with its striking greenery. Heres Quinto handsome and dapper traipsing around Berlin in a tailored grey suit - even the wardrobe is lavish. (Agent 47s own black suit is the subject of the films most amusing one-liner. The killer scours a closet before hanging up his jacket. ""Bombs?"" asks Katia. ""Moths"" he replies dryly. ""Italian wool They love it."") Of course this isnt exactly Skyfall with its painterly globetrotting; nobody has an eye like cinematographer Roger Deakins. But in the realm of the vapid any serious aspiration toward beauty ought to be savoured for it.Its tempting to think Hitman undermines any beauty it musters with its habit of ridiculousness. This is an outrageous film to be sure - theres 10-mile headshots and skyscraper-dimming electrocutions mysterious torture serums and asthma puffers jerry-rigged as bombs. And yet the friction between stateliness and lunacy is more intriguing than say the line-toeing mediocrity of a second-rate Marvel movie. I suppose it isnt fashionable to be so strange - or to be strange in just this way. But Ill always prefer an identity that risks embarrassment to a riskless nonentity.

Again so much for originality.Happily there are differences between the two. ""American Ultra"" carries the sheen of a romantic stoner comedy (nothing funnier than seeing a guy get killed with a spoon) while ""Hitman"" based on a video game goes for a more sci-fi Bond type of vibe.""American Ultra"" also features the not inconsiderable talents and chemistry of Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart while ""Hitman"" relies on the lesser-known but perfectly adequate Rupert Friend (""Homeland"") and Hannah Ware. Both films are rated R one runs 95 minutes the other 96 and each boasts big-tussle high-quality villains as well -- the incomparable Walton Goggins in ""American Ultra"" and Zachary Quinto in ""Hitman.""Actually its unclear for a while who the villain is in ""Hitman."" We find out early that the titular Agent 47 (Friend) has been genetically bred and trained to be an assassin and hes very good at his job. Hes part of a program that was discontinued when a geneticist ran off with his young daughter taking the secrets to making hitmen with him.Fifteen years later the daughter (Ware) Agent 47 and a nasty international corporation that wants to make more hitmen are all looking for the geneticist (Ciarin Hinds). A fellow named John Smith (Quinto) suddenly appears alongside the daughter warning her 47 is coming to get her. After much gunplay and hysterics he whisks her off to safety. Until 47 shows up again and it turns out he just wants to release her inner hitwoman.This is all followed by gunplay gunplay and more gunplay all handled in glossy tones by first-time director Aleksander Bach. As such films go its efficiently done juvenilia.""American Ultra"" is obviously aiming a bit higher while still embracing low-brow silliness. Mike (Eisenberg) works at a convenience store in a small town where he lives with his beautiful punkish girlfriend Phoebe (Stewart) the both of them in a consistent bong haze.Then one night two thugs try to kill Mike in the stores empty parking lot whereupon to his own great surprise he kills them both with a cup of ramen soup and a spoon. What is happening? He calls Phoebe they go on the run and its revealed that Mike was the only successful product of a CIA experiment to transform wayward youths into super killers.Now a CIA honcho has turned a squadron of repurposed madmen led by a loony called Laugher (Goggins) loose on Mike. Can he survive? Hint He killed a guy with a cup of soup.Like the pros they are Eisenberg and Stewart bring a refreshing amount of sincerity to the bloody antics and ""Project X"" director Nima Nourizadeh handles the literal fireworks with a sense of glee. You never fully buy ""American Ultra"" -- youre not supposed to -- but its a decent ride with some nice turns.If only the ride didnt feel so familiar.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongHitman Agent 47GRADE C+Rated R for sequences of strong violence and some languageRunning time 96 minutesAmerican UltraGRADE BRated R for strong bloody violence language throughout drug use and some sexual contentRunning time 95 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1LnXddV MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/08/21/movie-review-tom-long-american-ultra-hitman-bodies-everywhere/32095821/,200,hitmanagent473,hitmanagent47,detroitnews
"Review Hitman Agent 47 runs quickly out of storytelling firepower - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Hitman Agent 47 runs quickly out of storytelling firepower Hitman Agent 47 Reiner Bajo/Twentieth Century Fox Rupert Friend left and Hannah Ware appear in a scene from ""Hitman Agent 47."" Rupert Friend left and Hannah Ware appear in a scene from ""Hitman Agent 47."" (Reiner Bajo/Twentieth Century Fox) Robert Abele The slick chaotically empty gunplay party ""Hitman Agent 47"" hopes to be a loud August reminder to comic book-addled moviegoers that video games want to be franchises too. Unfortunately this arsenal of nonsense -- technically a do-over of the IO Interactive console staple last filmed as ""Hitman"" in 2007 -- is all too content to pad its digitally slapped-together action scenes with the kind of narrative coherence and dialogue you wouldnt call bulletproof.Frenzied opening narration (never a good sign) details the background a secret government ""Agent"" program that built emotionless perfect assassins but had to be disbanded yadda yadda yadda. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;All we can really gather is that the killing machine played by Rupert Friend -- the 47th version in a long line of black-suited red-tie-sporting clones who dont experience fear -- and Zachary Quintos corporate agent are looking for the same woman in hiding. Shes a skittish beauty (damsel-y Hannah Ware) with ties to the missing scientist (Ciaran Hinds) who devised the original Agent program. Hollywood surely sympathizes with any attempt to relaunch a brand but in this case Agent 47 is out to prevent his kind from being rebooted and upgraded by any organization. Cue the mayhem.

But its not enough to make us care or to keep the third act from being a head-scratching mess.

Photo Credit Twentieth Century Fox / Reiner Bajo advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young woman finds herself hunted by genetically enhanced assassins. Rated R (graphic violence language). BOTTOM LINE About as violent and soulless as its title suggests. CAST Rupert Friend Zachary Quinto Hannah Ware LENGTH 96 minutes ""Hitman Agent 47"" begins with a short preamble that looks and sounds like a government dossier then delves straight into brain-splattering gunplay. If that sounds like the first few moments of an action-based video game its because this movie is based on one. ""Hitman Agent 47"" couldnt possibly be as much fun as the Xbox or PlayStation versions though. You cant control it and you wont get any bonus points for finishing it. Rupert Friend plays the title character a genetically enhanced assassin who feels no fear pain or love. At least he still has a fashion sense dark suits red ties and shiny guns are his defining aesthetic. Expressionless humorless and shaved nearly bald to display the bar-code on his nape 47 is a dehumanized over-adrenalized and better-dressed version of Peter Quinn the mercenary Friend plays on Showtimes ""Homeland."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Agent 47 has been assigned to find a young Berliner Katia (Hannah Ware) who is also being followed by Agent John Smith (Zachary Quinto way out of his element). What do they want and which is the good guy? As it happens Katia can take care of herself. She is fast-moving and hyper-intelligent and has the remarkable ability to ""see"" what just about anyone anywhere might be doing. (Like many such powers it kind of comes and goes.) Katia also has a mission of her own to find a reclusive scientist named Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds). Even by the low standards of late-summer junk ""Hitman Agent 47"" is a pretty soulless and joyless affair. Its the usual aspirational fashion-spread of Italian suits German sedans and Scotch whiskey all presented with little style or originality. The screenplay by Skip Woods (""The A-Team"") and Michael Finch (""Predators"") is a chop-shop job assembled from other movies; in fact this is a re-boot of 2007s ""Hitman."" The first-time director Aleksander Bach maneuvers his emotionless actors as if by joystick. ""Hitman Agent 47"" does make use of some eye-popping locales in Singapore notably the vertiginous skywalk of the Gardens by the Bay and it rigs up one inventive stunt in which a speeding Audi is harpooned like a tuna. Steel yourself for a few dozen sequels because someone in this film mentions an Agent 90.

"American Ultra and Hitman Agent 47add up to the boring identityreviews | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAmerican Ultra and Hitman Agent 47add up to the boring identityreviewsAmerican Ultra and Hitman Agent 47 movies working the same brainwashed assassin angle as The Bourne Identity both open this weekend. Neither do much to inspire further imitation.Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart team up in American Ultra.Rupert Friend and Hanna Ware get cracking in Hitman Agent 47.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 20 2015American UltraStarring Jesse Eisenberg Kristen Stewart Topher Grace Connie Britton and John Leguizamo. Directed by Nima Nourizadeh. Opens Aug. 21 at GTA theatres. 96 minutes. 18ASince the blockbuster success of The Bourne Identity and its sequels (plus The Manchurian Candidate a generation earlier) the concept of a brainwashed agent/assassin has become the hoariest of action tropes.Which explains why two movies working this angle American Ultra and Hitman Agent 47 are being off-loaded in the same week in these fading days of summer. Neither does much to inspire further imitation.Article Continued BelowAmerican Ultra at least has the novelty of reuniting Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart who were more happily paired for the 2009 indie rom-com Adventureland.Here theyre ""the perfect f---ed-up couple"" in the fictional West Virginia backwater of Liman which not so coincidentally shares a name with Bourne director Doug Liman. Eisenberg is Mike a shaggy-headed and perpetually stoned convenience store clerk and avid cartoonist. Stewart is Phoebe the devoted and only slightly baked girlfriend who keeps everything together. Maybe theyll get married if Mike can overcome his constant anxiety to pop the question.Theyre no big deal in other words. So why does weird stuff keep happening like two carjackers exploding into gore at the spoon-wielding hands of Mike who is astonished by his lethal ninja skills with cutlery?""Theres a chance I may be a robot"" he tells a disbelieving Phoebe.No Mike is just the result of a CIA superagent experiment gone awry and now the agency led by a scheming bureaucrat (Topher Grace) wants to shut er down as you would a broken snow cone machine.Director Nima Nourizadeh (Project X) and scriptwriter Max Landis (Chronicle) could have gone for the laughs in this inhaling assassin scenario paying homage more to Pineapple Express than The Bourne Identity and its imitators. There are a few chuckles but not enough.Instead they take the path most travelled with Connie Britton John Leguizamo Tony Hale Walton Goggins and Bill Pullman along for the ride and a lot of blood smearing the trail. American Ultra has its moments but its mostly a waste of good weed and better actors.Hitman Agent 47Starring Rupert Friend Hannah Ware Zachary Quinto Ciaran Hinds and Thomas Kretschmann. Opens Aug. 21 at GTA theatres. 96 minutes. 14AWhos human and whos not consumes much of the running time of rote actioner Hitman Agent 47 which vainly attempts to revive a forgotten video-game spinoff starring Timothy Olyphant.The real head-scratcher though involves rookie director Aleksander Bach and screenwriters Skip Woods and Michael Finch. Are these guys for real?With bog-level plotting as it hopscotches across Europe and Asia and such cliched dialogue as ""You cant run from who you are"" and ""You and I arent so very different"" its as if the robots were running the asylum.Homelands Rupert Friend dons a Rodney Dangerfield suit and red tie and resists cracking a smile as the factory-made title killer with a bar-code tattoo. Hes the 47th rendition of a mad scientists (Ciaran Hinds) designer hit man project endowed with super skills but zero personality.Agent 47 is chasing after the scientists daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) for reasons that become obvious long before theyre revealed courtesy of overused whiplash flashbacks and foreshadowing. Another interested party (Zachary Quinto) is working his own kill-by-numbers agenda all of it involving many bullets shattered glass and exploding buildings.The worst insult in this movie is to call somebody ""a failed experiment.""The same thing can be said about the movie although its an experiment weve seen too many times before.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Rupert Friend stars as a genetically engineered assassin known only by the last two digits - 47 - of a barcode tattooed on the back of his neck.(Photo 20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 stars out of 5Rupert Friend has a knack for creating soulful empathetic characters in such projects as ""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont"" and TVs ""Homeland."" Playing the title role in ""Hitman Agent 47"" he goes way against type starring as an emotionless killing machine with barely a hint of humanity. Now Im all for a performer stretching but this doesnt seem like it plays to Friends particular strengths. Whats next? Jason Statham as Tevye in a revival of ""Fiddler on the Roof""?""Hitman Agent 47"" is based on a video game which tells you a lot about what to expect. For example plot and characterization both are secondary to the kicky action sequences in which Agent 47 relentlessly and methodically eliminates anyone who gets in his way. All the butt-kicking takes place in exotic locales such as Singapores Gardens by the Bay so its like getting a tourism commercial and mindlessly violent potboiler all at the same time.AZCENTRALThese 10 hit-man movies are right on targetThe plot is simultaneously overstuffed and lean. Agent 47 is a genetically engineered human created by a scientist who now is missing. Agent 47 is tracking down Katia (Hannah Ware from TVs ""Boss"") a nervous neurotic woman with amazing mathematical skills and troubling flashbacks. There also is a third member of the triangle John Smith (Zachary Quinto) who shows up to explain to Katia (and the audience) what all the shooting and slicing is about.Newbie director Aleksander Bach handles the project with a competent precision. The film doesnt rise above the genre and the plot is muddled but he pulls off the basic elements with a distinctly chilly European style. Things blow up heads smash together and blood spatters; its moderately entertaining and instantly forgettable. In that way its a lot like a video game.AZCENTRALHitman Agent 47 (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

The whole reason games work as a form of entertainment is that theyre interactive and empowering. If the controller is yanked out of our hands and were made to sit and passively watch the characters and story had better be interesting as hell. The characters and story in Hitman Agent 47 are not interesting as hell. Or interesting period. Hitman Agent 47 is the second movie based on the long-running series of games by Denmarks IO Interactive and while 2007s Hitman (starring Timothy Olyphant as the bald genetically enhanced assassin) was a critical dud it made a decent chunk of cash on a relatively modest budget. Thus here we go again. Hitman Agent 47 is a reboot of sorts with Rupert Friend (Homeland) playing the nattily dressed assassin with a barcode etched on the back of his stubbly dome. Having left behind the clone farm where he and his brethren were grown in a secret scheme to create perfect killing machines Agent 47 is out to make sure the project cant be resurrected by the sinister Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) the head of an organization called Syndicate International. (Presumably ""Corporation Incorporated"" was already taken.) This tangles 47 up with a mysterious woman named Katia (Hannah Ware) who is searching for her father (Game of Thrones Ciaran Hinds) unaware that hes the founder of the assassin program. All of them are being pursued by John Smith (Star Treks Zachary Quinto) and NO ONE IS WHAT QUITE THEY SEEM. By the time were told who is on whos team and why Katia seems to have Daredevils senses and reflexes the movie is basically on autopilot until its silly explodey conclusion. Fans of the Hitman game series might enjoy some of the callouts in the movie from Agent 47s improbably quick disguise changes to the twin Hardballer pistols and garrotte that are his weapons of choice. And despite 47s bald noggin being a bit stubbly this time around Friend looks and sounds more like the game character than Olyphant did. But at the risk of getting too nerdy making movies based on the Hitman games seems like an odd proposition to begin with. In the games players score the most points for being silent and unseen assassinating targets with skill and subtlety and escaping before anyone realizes whats happened. Here 47s approach to assassinations seems to be shoot the living crap out anything and everything that moves. Blowing up cars hurling soldiers into jet turbines gunning down baddies in the middle of a busy intersection - the word inconspicuous is not in this hitmans vocabulary. What it lacks in brains Hitman Agent 47 attempts to make up for with action even if not much of it is particularly memorable. Quick-cut fistfights bullets-a-blazin gun battles and lots of things going boom help distract from the thuddingly wooden dialogue as does the captivating architecture of Singapore that forms the backdrop of the movies third act. The whole thing looks and feels like an extended episode of some Starz series and you almost get the sense that first-time feature film director Aleksander Bach is attempting to ape the Resident Evil movies another franchise with bad writing silly action and only the most tenuous connection to the video games that inspired it. If Hitman Agent 47 makes enough cash this might not be the last time we see the bald assassin on the big screen. (And the groanworthy DUN-DUN-DUNNN moment in the credits suggests there could be more though surely the actor in question has bigger projects to work on now.) But with the tide slowly turning for video game films - on deck are Assassins Creed and Splinter Cell movies starring talented A-list actors Michael Fassbender and Tom Hardy respectively - maybe Hitman Agent 47 like its titular character is a dying breed. If so well have truly dodged a bullet. Twitter stevetilley steve.tilleysunmedia.ca Readers comments >> By adding a comment on the site you accept our terms and conditions.

(Photo credit Reiner Bajo//R.Bajo) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday August 20 2015 244 PM Title HITMAN AGENT 47 Film Info With Rupert Friend Zachary Quinto. A perfect killer needs a woman to lead him to a scientist. Director Aleksander Bach (136). R Violence. Area theaters. ""HITMAN AGENT 47"" is 100% laughable. This adaptation of a video game -- and a reboot of a film franchise that nobody cared was missing -- is full of characters with made-up-on-the-spot powers. And weightless action scenes. And dialogue best heard with a game controller in your hand. Lines like ""Give me an update"" ""Well be safe here"" ""When this is done I will kill you."" The story such as it is follows the nameless Agent 47 (Rupert Friend). Hes the product of a secret genetic program that decades ago bred humane emotion out of its subjects unimaginatively called ""agents"" while heightening their deadly skills. Agent 47 supposedly the last in the line is after Katia (Hannah Ware) a strangely intuitive woman whose scientist father started the program. Also trailing Katia is a mysterious guy calling himself John Smith (Zachary Quinto) who also has powers. He has ""subdermal titanium armor"" or an invincible skin shield that helps him catch bullets and survive attacks. ""They perfected that?"" asks the scientist. Oh yes they did but they didnt perfect this movie. Ridiculous chases start and end without logic involving crashing glass amid stopovers in what 007 author Ian Fleming once termed ""thrilling cities"" (Berlin Singapore). Friend whose character sports a bar code on his bald head is impeccably dressed and to his credit moves fluidly from villain to hero. Quinto seems to be making fun of the movie hes in though the movie doesnt know it. These guys are along for the ride but the one who fares best is Ware. She maintains an angular beauty and brittle normalcy even in moronic moments. In an elevator between shootouts she nonchalantly puts her hair in a ponytail before readying for battle. ""Hitman Agent 47"" is a by-the-numbers schlock action sequel that writes its own epitaph when a character mutters the dusty insult ""Youre dead too. You just dont know it yet."" jneumaiernydailynews.com Follow me on TWITTER  NeumaierMovies Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Movie Reviews 08/20/2015 0656pm Hitman Agent 47 Half man half machine entirely obvious Richard Roeper richardroeper | email Were constantly reminded of the video game origins of ""Hitman Agent 47"" from the pulsating music designed to keep our blood pumping to the heavy use of quick cuts interspersed with super-slow-mo violence to the look and even the performances of the slick and attractive cast. Not for a second does any of this feel like anything that could take place in anything resembling the real world but I suppose thats the point. We dont attend something like ""Hitman Agent"" looking for gritty realism but what we DO expect is an entertaining and reasonably clever thrill ride. No such luck. The problem is the action sequences are nothing special the big-picture questions about mans attempt to create a more advanced and more lethal version of himself have been tackled with far more depth and grace in dozens of sci-fi thrillers from ""Blade Runner"" to the early ""Terminator"" movies to ""Ex Machina"" and the plot is just high-tech Swiss Cheese filled with holes and smelling like last weeks refrigerator contents. Heres the deal if you must know. Long ago a top-secret organization created a program in which humans were engineered from early childhood to become perfect killing machines with superhero-level fighting abilities and virtually no conscience or heart. No regrets no feelings of loneliness no empathy no interest in love. These half-human half-machine creations were known as ""agents"" identified only by the last two digits on the barcode tattooed on the backs of their necks. (Imagine the confusion at supermarket checkout counters.) If youre Agent 22 that means youre more advanced than the 21 projects who preceded you but you hope to never to run into Agent 23 in a dark alley. But the program was shut down because programs such as this are almost always shut down in movies like this. Things start to go wrong. The scientist who created the program realizes it will be co-opted by governments intent on creating indestructible armies. And blah de blah blah blah. Looking lean lethal and mean his head shaved (the better for us to see that barcode tattoo) and his suits perfectly tailored Rupert Friend does fine work as Agent 47 perhaps the last of his kind still in existence. Agent 47 has been given the task of tracking down Katia (Hannah Ware) a beautiful and deeply troubled woman who is obsessed with tracking down Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds) the genius who created the program all those years ago and has been living off the grid for decades. If he can find Katia he can find Litvenko which means an evil conglomerate bent on restarting the agent program can tap into Litvenkos genius because he has the blueprint for the whole thing memorized. Katias such a mess she doesnt even know WHY shes trying to find Litvenko. Not that its difficult to figure out their connection from the get-go. Zachary Quinto is John Smith who seems to possess at least equal speed strength cunning and firepower as Agent 47. John Smith shows up in Katias life just in time to save her life multiple times. What a guy. Agent 47 and John Smith engage in a number of shootouts and hand-to-hand combat sequences. Dozens of anonymous assassins representing various interests show up en masse and proceed to get killed either by gunfire or having their necks snapped or getting stabbed. In other words the usual R-rated fun and games. Director Aleksander Bach seems to be having quite the good time creating elaborate fight sequences and shootouts. The screenplay by Skip Woods and Michael Finch contains some major zigs and zags but one can see the big twists coming a mile away. All signs point to a sequel and maybe even multiple ""Hitman"" films. After sitting through this one you might view that as more of a threat than a promise. [s3r star=1.5/4] Twentieth Century Fox presents a film directed by Aleksander Bach and written by Michael Finch and Kyle Ward. Running time 96 minutes. Rated R (for sequences of strong violence and some language).

Comments Hitman Agent 47 Video Rated R  96 minutes  2015 Based on the video game Hitman this soulless actioner involves genetically engineered assassins with bar codes on the backs of their shaved heads. The title agent (Rupert Friend) struts around in a dark suit squeezing off pistol shots from each hand as he stalks a young woman (Hannah Ware) for reasons to be revealed later; help beckons in the form of a friendly government agent (Zachary Quinto) though even he isnt what he seems. Aleksander Bach making his feature debut dresses up the endless chase with digital and laser gimmickry; he likes to film through windows as bullets shatter heads inside throwing gore on the glass and he likes to have people run up and down metal stairs so they can fall over balconies and break their backs on the handrails. Michael Finch collaborated on the screenplay with Skip Woods former proprietor of a ""weapons handling and tactical consulting firm"" in Texas. By J.R.

EntertainmentMovies Hitman Agent 47 Futuristic thriller is deadly repetitive Originally published August 20 2015 at 1205 am Updated August 20 2015 at 724 am Rupert Friend is a genetically engineered assassin in ""Hitman Agent 47."" (Photo credit Reiner Bajo//R.Bajo) Movie review of ""Hitman Agent 47"" The versatile Rupert Friend stars in this futuristic thriller about a genetically engineered assassin. Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By John HartlSpecial to The Seattle Times The versatile Rupert Friend (""Homeland"" ""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont"") heads the stellar cast of this deadly shockingly repetitive futuristic thriller about a genetically engineered assassin -- a mixture of 007 and ""The Terminator"" that just wont stop. As ""Hitman Agent 47"" piles up the bodies and body parts Schwarzenegger-style its difficult to keep score. Whos really dead and whos pretending? The movie feels like a continuous loop in which shape-shifting characters put on all sorts of hide-and-seek disguises. Friend seems at first to be the villain but (spoiler alert) this may not be the case. Zachary Quinto asks for the trust of the heroine (Hannah Mare) and he seems to deserve it for a while at least. But what led such gifted actors as Ciaran Hinds (""Munich"") and Thomas Kretchmann (""The Pianist"") to trust this script? Movie Review 1/2   Hitman Agent 47 with Rupert Friend Zachary Quinto Hannah Mare Thomas Kretchmann Ciaran Hinds. Directed by Aleksander Bach from a screenplay by Kyle Ward Skip Woods and Michael Finch. 96 minutes. Rated R for sequences of strong violence and some language. Several theaters. On the surface -- and thats all there is -- it seems as pointless and gassy as a ""Matrix"" sequel. A speech invoking God as competition for creating destructive life-forms is particularly cringe-worthy. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Photo Twentieth Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW Hitman Agent 47 Running time 85 minutes. Rated R (violence profanity). ""Hitman"" movies are proving as disposable as tissue. Only eight years after a film based on the ""Hitman"" video game appeared ""Hitman Agent 47"" assumes weve already forgotten the other movie. Good call guys. Rupert Friend plays the titular assassin a genetically engineered killing machine who amounts to the Terminators cloddish cousin. He is trying to take out the daughter (Hannah Ware) of the scientist (Ciaran Hinds) who designed him before a rival (Zachary Quinto) can save her. Friend replaced Paul Walker after the latters death but whereas Walker might have brought some spark to the role Friend seems not to understand theres a difference between being fierce and being dull. The film was shot on location in Berlin and Singapore and Friend is out-acted by the gorgeous scenery. Not that the screenplay gives him much help Impervious to everything he glides through a series of interchangeably ridiculous mass-slaughter scenes in which for instance squadrons of assassins helpfully rappel down from the tops of skyscrapers to allow Agent 47 to shoot them. Its all as pointless as the asthma inhaler with which one character treats his advanced lung cancer.

Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last. Lazy scattershot and excruciatingly unfunny the movie is a hazard to the very young who might come away with the erroneous impression that movies dont get any better than this."" Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Singapore looks like a dreamy place to visit. Thats one of few worthwhile discoveries in ""Hitman Agent 47"" a soulless joyless ""Bourne""-movie wannabe. The story has all the nuance of a ""first-person shooter"" video game. As it turns out the movie is based on one. Skip Woods and Michael Finch wrote the screenplay for director Aleksander Bachs feature debut. This is Woodss second go at bringing the video game ""Hitman"" to the big screen after the 2007 film ""Hitman"" with Timothy Olyphant in the title role. This time its Rupert Friend (""Homeland"") whose talents are wasted in a part where he does little more than look cool in a well-tailored suit. His character is essentially a robot. Trained as a child to be a killer his genes have been enhanced to make him smarter faster and stronger than your average Joe. (His good looks apparently are natural.) During the process he also was relieved of his ability to feel emotions. The man who created this conscience-free monster and others like him is Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds). Since he slipped off the grid several years ago various people have been looking for him including members of a nefarious syndicate that wants to use the scientists brain power to create an army of similar superagents. Thats right. In the decades since Agent 47 -- as Friends character is known -- was created no other geneticist has been able to crack the code of how to make them. The syndicates sinister emissary is the prominently eyebrowed John Smith (who other than Zachary Quinto?) who is trying to ingratiate himself with Litvenkos daughter. If the group can get to Katia (Hannah Ware) it believes it can find the scientist too. Meanwhile 47 has been assigned to take Katia out which is a shame seeing as she seems like a nice lady even if she has no idea who she is or why she can see events before they happen. And thats just the beginning of the story. Of course none of this matters as much as the action which though well-executed is missing one key element consequences. Is 47 the good guy? Thats unclear. This leaves little reasons to root for him -- other than his super-chill demeanor his ability to use two guns at once and his impeccably defined cheekbones. We dont even know his motives especially once he defies orders and rescues Katia from John. The movie -- which looks and sounds like a more brutal Bond knockoff -- is at least consistently stylish though its tone is less assured. While the script makes some attempts at the quippy one-liners typical of todays action movies theyre delivered with mechanical inelegance mainly by 47 and Katia. Recognizing where the humor could have been is more painful than if it had never existed at all. But never mind all that. Singapore -- one of the many places the film takes us -- looks amazing. (We learn each new location via on-screen titles accompanied by the beep-beep-beep of a computer.) One of the scenes set there inside the glass enclosure of that citys futuristic Gardens by the Bay park features a laughable attempt at sentimentality. Dont underestimate the power of distraction. Somehow everything seems slightly less idiotic inside a high-tech greenhouse. R. At area theaters. Contains strong violence and language. 96 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Skip Woods must truly believe in the cinematic potential of the video game Hitman. Usually a do-over like Hitman Agent 47--the kind of soft reboot that seems more like a recast DTV sequel--recruits new filmmakers to set a would-be franchise on a different course. But Woods the sole credited screenwriter on 2007s Hitman rematerializes in the credits of Agent 47 receiving story and co-writing credits despite having worked on the earlier ill-received version. Its hard to tell whether this means Fox repurposed a sequel draft or actually re-upped with Woods for the new version but regardless the studio taking another shot at Hitman does make sense at least on paper. Its a world of ruthless superhuman globetrotting assassins and it seems like good material for a B-movie.Unfortunately all of its materials feel utterly and depressingly synthetic right down to the most basic ingredients of almost any violent B-grade action movie cars blood and fire which all get the bad-CGI treatment. In fact the most surprising credit on Agent 47--even more so than the return of Skip Woods--is the presence of the legendary Industrial Light amp; Magic on the special effects team. Unless they created the actors wholesale from a hard drive the effects in this movie represent some of the crummiest-looking visuals to ever bear the ILM name. Frankly even if all of the performances are in fact secretly CG its not their most lifelike work. Thats not meant as a burn on Rupert Friend who takes over the title role of the bald bar-coded super-assassin and in doing so looks a bit like an aggrieved version of onetime Saturday Night Live cast member Paul Brittain. Its a part that previously defeated Timothy Olyphant.Agent 47 who is hyped by the movie as engineered to lack fear emotion attachments and so on is hot on the trail of Katia (Hannah Ware) who herself is hot on the trail of a man she doesnt remember but knows she must find. Katia is also pursued by other men from an organization called the Syndicate (not to be confused with the group Ethan Hunt pursues in the most recent Mission Impossible) because they are also looking for this mystery man who can unlock the secrets of the genetic engineering that created Agent 47 and his ilk in the first place.The movie tries to pull off the transition from The Terminator to Terminator 2 in a single film by positioning Agent 47 as a force of malevolence before teaming him up with Katia whereupon he becomes a force of if not exactly good then perhaps a sort of neutrality. His allegiances lie less with good guys in particular than violent murder in general. That vagueness is why the big switch fails to register; Hitman Agent 47 is largely amoral in the sense that the good guys and the bad guys seem indistinguishable operating only in a closed chase-loop. This leaves only the chase itself and the accompanying fights shoot-outs and smash-ups to give the movie its reason for being. Director Aleksander Bach assembles these action sequences semi-coherently but with little inspiration or even much interest in fooling the audience into thinking theyre watching characters instead of shutter-stuttered stunt doubles. Most of the time the best he can do is recreate the sensation of watching more visually distinct recent action movies. One strobe-lit massacre looks a joyless imitation of John Wick; other moments briefly recall the Resident Evil series and The Wolverine. In between its knockoffs the movie stalls with several scenes where battalions of anonymous bad guys receive nearly identical orders and a surprising amount of screen time spent waiting for face-recognition software to turn up matches. Even on its chosen level this Hitman opts not to make much sense To retrieve the super-assassin recipe for example the Syndicate employs an ""experimental"" super-assassin of their own who with his titanium-enforced skin seems far closer to invulnerability than Agent 47 himself. After a while it seems a bit like hiring the T-1000 to unlock the secrets of the T-800--or hiring John Wick to retrieve a DVD of Hitman Agent 47.Agent 47 is just slightly less dull than its disavowed predecessor--or at least its dullness seems less active because it doesnt turn anyone as inherently interesting as Olyphant into a dour-faced killing machine. It manages a few tiny flashes of understated wit like a silent elevator ride shared by Katia and Agent 47. But mostly it makes a clear cogent case for why no one should ever make a Hitman movie ever again--just in time for an optimistic barely-mid-credits tease for exactly that. Woods must be so excited to see it.

Hitman Agent 47 is dead on arrival KATIE WALSH Tribune News Service Chris Etling Aug 19 2015 0 Buy Now Reiner Bajo/20th Century Fox Rupert Friend in ""Hitman Agent 47."" If you see one movie about governmentally modified assassins this weekend dont make it ""Hitman Agent 47."" ""American Ultra"" is the far superior take on the unknowing super spy because it takes itself far less seriously and can actually poke fun at the genre. ""Hitman Agent 47"" was just never going to be able to keep up especially with its overly serious take on the genre. Its so coldblooded its practically reptilian.Directed by newcomer Aleksander Bach with a screenplay by Skip Woods and Michael Finch the story seems overly complicated but is actually quite simple Someones trying to make more of the genetically enhanced ""agents"" and in order to succeed they need to find the originator of the project Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds) who has dropped off the face of the earth. In pursuit are Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) a contract killer so focused on his job hes practically a robot and John Smith (a woefully miscast Zachary Quinto) who works for the private organization Syndicate International. 47 is trying to stop Syndicate from making more agents. He works for a woman Diana (Angelababy; that is actually her name) who gives him cryptic instructions on the phone. Caught in the middle is Litvenkos daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) who is also searching for her father having been abandoned as a child equipped with near psychic survival skills including an extra-sensory perception for lurking dangers. She falls in with Smith and 47 and after a series of rapidly switching alliances theyre off to the races with a quick training for her while in pursuit of her father. Theres a half-baked attempt to answer some existential questions about the nature of humanity when youre a murderous robot person but the sentimentality doesnt mesh with the films desire for cathartic cinematic violence. Unfortunately the action that we do get is chaotic and incomprehensible largely bloodless and without any sense of tension. There are times when it feels profoundly like a first-person shooter video game which makes sense because its based on one. Something like ""John Wick"" worked beautifully to showcase a waterfall of cascading murder. Wicks motivations were clear vengeance. Agent 47s motivations arent clear because hes barely a human despite Katias protestations otherwise. Hes just doing his job and ultimately the film is about work -- what it means to work a job that strips ones humanity in the service of a contract and what it means when your lifes work results in those agents. However the execution of that particular story just falls flat in the sanguine ""Hitman Agent 47."" HITMAN AGENT 47 1.5 out of 4 stars Rated R for sequences of strong violence and some language. Cast Rupert Friend Zachary Quinto Hannah Ware Ciaran Hinds Directed by Aleksander Bach Running time 96 minutes Chris Etling Chris Etling is a copy editor and paginator at the Arizona Daily Sun.

Thats not always a death sentence as plenty of airheaded movies provide adrenalized popcorn thrills without stopping to ask for directions or worrying about relationships or plot mechanics. Sometimes visceral thrills are more than enough. In fact Agent 47 is at its best when it leans into its simple-mindedness and wears it like a badge of pride--something its predecessor 2007s Timothy Olyphant-led Hitman was able to nail more often than not. The follow-up has very little to do with that movie though it does follow the same basic thread The titular Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) is an elite genetically-engineered assassin hired to track the scientist who oversaw the experiment that created him in order to stop an evil organization called the Syndicate from creating an army of emotionless killing machines. He teams up with the scientists daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) and ultimately must square off against a fellow genetic freak who calls himself John Smith (Zachary Quinto). Poke any portion of that story cookie and it will turn to crumbs. For example Katia is already hunting for her father when she runs into 47 but she admits she doesnt know who shes looking for or why shes looking for him. Later she finds out shes also been enhanced granted with superhuman survival skills that mostly manifest in a sort of Spidey sense. But how did she even get started on this quest? And how come her wacky super power only works when its convenient to the script? Who is funding all of this what does the Syndicate do and is it the same sinister group that exists in the Mission Impossible universe? Those questions cover about 45 seconds of the film and there are plenty more where that came from. But every once in a while Hitman Agent 47 puts together a chase a fistfight or a shoot-out that turns wanton violence into high art the way that John Wick did (and lo and behold the second unit director on Agent 47 is John Wick co-director David Leitch). The opening gun battle and the multiple bits involving jet engines are particularly spectacular and lend the movie a visual panache that belies its clearly modest budget. Its occasionally funny too particularly once Katia and 47 start spending more time together. Its just too bad the movie is not enough of any of these things. A few more bits of scenery chewing and a more consistent helping of turned-to-11 mayhem might have mutated Hitman Agent 47 into a cult classic. But in this post-Mad Max Fury Road action movie age ""occasionally bonkers"" just doesnt cut it anymore.

During a rare moment of quiet amid the glass-smashing brain-bashing mayhem of ""Hitman Agent 47"" a character offers the wise observation that we are all a bit more complicated than our internal circuitry might suggest. Applying this logic to the movie itself its fair to conclude that while Aleksander Bachs directing debut is indeed the junky incoherent shoot-em-up we feared it might be to dismiss it as just another late-August studio craptacular doesnt quite do it justice. But what to call it exactly? The 47th best action film of 2015? A feature-length Audi commercial or a promo reel for the Singapore Tourism Board? The most unnecessary artistic contribution ever made by someone named Bach? Fox is surely hoping that ""surprise box office hit"" might be a plausible alternative though the best one will likely be able to say on that front is that where disastrous franchise relaunches are concerned its no ""Fantastic Four."" Indeed many of those who pay to see ""Hitman Agent 47"" will have no idea that its a reboot of ""Hitman"" (2007) the forgettable EuropaCorp-produced first film adapted from the IO Interactive videogame about a chrome-domed genetically engineered contract killer. Ruthlessly precise in his targeting and virtually invincible Agent 47 was first played by Tim Olyphant in the first movie and is embodied here by the steely-gazed Rupert Friend (""Homeland"") coolly donning the characters familiar black suit white shirt and red necktie. He also sports a back-of-the-head barcode tattoo that serves as a continual visual reminder that 47 was cooked up in a government laboratory back in the 1960s and that he is a cold-blooded killer devoid of such ordinary human qualities as fear compassion and love. In the new film however 47s mission is not to preserve and uphold his murderous order but rather to destroy it or at least keep it from being permanently reinstated. To do that he must head to Berlin and track down Katia (Hannah Ware ""Betrayal"") a guarded young woman whos spent her entire life looking over her shoulder and not without reason. As is revealed soon enough Katia possesses both a mysterious ability to foresee the immediate future and a mysterious connection with Dr. Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds) the scientist who first devised the Agent program. Also in the mix is John Smith (Zachary Quinto) a highly skilled fighter who early on assumes the role of Katias protector giving her fair warning about exactly what kind of danger shes up against. Together they will reinforce the well-known cinematic truth (also evident in the upcoming Owen Wilson thriller ""No Escape"") that if youre looking for a place to hide you should really steer clear of your nearest U.S. embassy where Agent 47 stages an audacious foolhardy assault on Katia John and the laws of probability. Eventually the characters make their way to Singapore to take down a sinister group known as the Syndicate Organization (not to be confused presumably with the Syndicate in ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"") that wants to kick the Agent program into high gear an act that would have disastrous consequences for humanity. But never mind all that. Insofar as ""Hitman Agent 47"" is about anything really its about the pleasures of being on location -- from the gratuitous image of Ware taking a dip in a five-star-hotel swimming pool to the sight of Singapores staggering Gardens by the Bay where were briefly allowed to stop and smell the orchids right before an impromptu shootout. Its about the sheen a luxury vehicle throws off as it races through the streets of Salzburg right before getting blown to smithereens in a sequence that gives the fine folks at Audi more than their moneys worth in product placement. Before it bogs down in dialogue of the ""You (Hero X) and I (Villain Y) are not so very different"" variety the screenplay -- credited to Skip Woods (who wrote the first ""Hitman"") and Michael Finch -- manages to juggle at least a few surprises where its characters motives and identities are concerned. (Judging by the particularly inexplicable developments in the muddled final reels some of the specifics still remain a mystery to the writers themselves.) And at its core the story does express a modicum of curiosity about whether a government-funded killing machine could retain his conscience -- a question that nods briefly in the direction of ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" with its incomparably poignant man-or-machine riddles. Still its target audience probably wont be too devastated to learn that ""Hitman Agent 47"" is not first and foremost a profound meditation on what it means to be human. Bach is too busy showing us what brains and other body parts look like when theyre dashed against the glossy white interiors of Syndicate HQ (courtesy of production designer Sebastian Krawinkel) or the bloody mess that ensues when someone gets sucked into the blades of a giant turbine engine -- an image that the movie returns to with queasy regularity. Even without these slaughterhouse aesthetics the script would give the actors little room to maneuver; in a role once intended for Paul Walker before his death in 2013 the unfriendly-looking Friend more or less gets the job done though both Quinto and Hinds feel disappointingly underused. As for relative newcomer Ware she looks credibly anxious even as her Katia becomes one of the more perfunctory action heroines in recent memory a woman with the gift of second sight in a movie that scarcely warrants a first viewing.

Genjurooo says September 22 2015 at 917 pm So Ive seen this movie couple of weeks ago and it was just fine. In fact I dont know what all these critics are on. Hitman 47 was put by the critics against Mission Impossible Rogue Nation The Man from Uncle and American Ultra. Well Ive seen only the MI and American Ultra but seriously MI is a borefest with a lame plot bad reasoning and done to death boring action. And American Ultra? That movie was like a TV episode of something. The premise of it was interesting but was so poorly written with such bad lines and with characters that did the most stupid things with the stupidest reasons possible. What these idiot critics smoke again? They rave over boring crap or nonsense crap (like furious 7) because 1. safe borefests without anything interesting are their game 2. money from the studios 3. go with the masses of morons whove seen like 2 movies their whole life and who think Furious 7 (or some other over-advertized garbage) is the best movie ever Hitman Agent 47 has better action than all the movies listed in this comment (excluding the one I didnt see yet) and even some sequence where the leads avoid just a bunch of airport cameras is more entertaining than MI+American Ultra+Furious7 COMBINED. Now I feel that I should watch Fantastic 4 too seeing the insanity going on with these critics nowadays. I mean this is not the first time they go full brainless en mass but I think it is the first time Im witnessing such a large mass of em doing that. Reply jimpeel says August 29 2015 at 717 pm Just watched the movie and it was as expected. Why does Variety expect every movie to be ""important""? This is not"" Gone with the wind "" it is a fantasy. Know the difference. It is for as many warning labels state "" for entertainment purposes only."" Stop expecting so much and simply sit back and enjoy the show. Reply Jacqueline says August 28 2015 at 122 am People who complain that reviewers only like Oscar bait clearly dont know that Furious 7 is at 81% on rotten tomatoes I had the misfortune of seeing that clunker now my bar for quality is set VERY low. I honestly call payola as it now seems random what is panned or praised. Furious 7 was given an 81 yet the latest Terminator got a 26%. Not a great movie by far but 1/3 as good as Furious 7?? Explain the math?? Not only that Avengers 2 with actual actors who actually act and a writer who can write a compelling script with actual jokes got a 74% Random I tell you Forget the critics read the reviews for entertainment only. I am planning to see Agent 47 tomorrow. I actually quite liked the 1st one even tho I am not the target audience neither male nor a gamer. Reply critic of critics says August 22 2015 at 1222 pm critics are all idiots who are payed to think for people i stopped listening to them a long time ago becasue they do not know what i like in fact all they do is make sure that the only movies that get made are stupid i hate critics you should all quit your jobs your usless wastes of space Reply Odinson2k14 says August 23 2015 at 303 am I agree in that while reviewers look for an oscar contender in EVERY movie you as a movieger may not be looking for that in a particular film. You look for a perfect movie in certain films bullets in others goofy laughs in others. If a lot of these critics had their way thered be nothing but Woody Allen movies playing at theater D. Reply pdmaar maajhi says August 21 2015 at 1256 pm I think Best Movie .. Reply Guest says August 20 2015 at 431 am Somethings shouldnt be adapted to films. Reply Anonymous says August 19 2015 at 403 pm I never understood why they made this. The first one was also a critical miss and failed at the box office so a sequel makes no sense by any metric. Reply LOL says August 20 2015 at 1236 pm Hollywood baby Reply irwinator1992 says August 19 2015 at 156 pm Last year Fox was having a ball. What the hell happened?? Reply macd says August 19 2015 at 1213 pm BREAKING NEWS The reviews are beginning to trickle in to Rotten Tomatoes. The score so far 11 out of 11 Rotten. Rating 0% Is Fox going to let this turkey out of its coop for Thursday night advance screenings? My guess is that the theatres will be so empty there will be plenty of room for last-minute bowling tournaments. Reply Taylor says August 19 2015 at 944 am Congratulations Fantastic Four It seems youre no longer the worst movie of 2015. In all seriousness though I feel bad for Rupert Friend. Hes a genuinely good actor and this was probably his only chance to be a leading man. Reply adele says August 19 2015 at 734 am With ""Hitman"" hot on the heels of ""Fantastic Four"" its now official. The name of the studio releasing these gems has been changed to 20th Century F-ks. Poor Darryl F. must be whirling in his grave. Reply gabyples says August 19 2015 at 726 am I liked the review more than Ill probably like the film itself. Im a big fan of the game if I ever catch this on cable will surely DVR Reply cadettssk says August 19 2015 at 617 am I plan on seeing the movie regardless of reviews.

TWITTER Rupert Friend (Homeland) stars as a killing machine in this slick version of a popular video game. A movie based on a video game that opens at the end of August does not exactly stir high expectations. And indeed Hitman Agent 47 turns out to be exactly the kind of fast-paced mind-numbing thriller that studios churn out to fill screens during the dog days of summer. The producers convinced some classy actors to jump aboard this careening nonsensical thrill ride so a few fanboys may join the party opening weekend. But dont expect to see the movie in September. British actor Rupert Friend has made a striking impression on the last few seasons of Showtimes Homeland displaying an impeccable American accent as well as a strong masculine presence. He brings those two qualities back to work playing the title character in this German-American production. A lump of exposition at the beginning tells us that in the 1960s a top scientist manufactured perfect robotic killing machines soldiers who would be remorseless and implacable.The program was eventually abandoned but at least one of the specimens survived. Now hes back to wreak a lot of havoc while shadowy forces try to destroy him and others hope to revive the super-military program that he embodied. A woman named Katia (Hannah Ware) is the protagonist the daughter of the master scientist whos now in hiding. Both the good guys and bad guys believe that she can lead them to her father before he dies so the chase is on. The movie borrows heavily from The Terminator in that a character named John Smith (dont trust anyone with that name) seems to be charged with saving the heroine from the Hitman who wants to wipe her out. But appearances deceive and soon heroes and villains are turned upside down. That much is clear; not much else makes sense in the hash of a screenplay concocted by Skip Woods and Michael Finch. Its a bit hard to know whos working for whom and what they all hope to gain. After a while you give up trying to make sense of the plot and sit there gaping at the car crashes fight scenes and shootings. The problem is that even the mayhem quickly becomes repetitive. Too many of the characters are invincible and its hard to get invested in people who are so hard to destroy. (Even Superman had to contend with Kryptonite.) First-time director Aleksander Bach a veteran of flashy commercials keeps things hurtling forward though even a slick action picture can quickly turn tedious when theres nothing significant at stake. A pointless journey from Berlin to Singapore at least allows for some spectacular scenic location shots. Among the actors Zachary Quinto as John Smith matches Friends sangfroid. Veterans Ciaran Hinds and Thomas Kretschmann give smooth performances in poorly written roles. Ware makes a mean action heroine who doesnt need as much protection as the men think. The ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel but that is probably wishful thinking on the part of the producers. Timothy Olyphant played the Hitman in a 2007 version of the video game that led to nothing except this retread eight years later. Could the killing machine return again? In Hollywood stranger things have happened.

Chandor Zachary Quinto Producing The Liars Ball Adaptation First Look at Shailene Woodley With Joseph Gordon-Levitt in Oliver Stones Snowden (Photo) Dont expect this reboot of the ""Hitman"" franchise starring Zachary Quinto and Rupert Friend to break the curse of bad movies made out of hit video games Violence is the point of ""Hitman Agent 47"" but there isnt enough of it to sustain this second film based on the ""Hitman"" video game series. Technically a reboot ""Agent 47"" is a redo at establishing a movie franchise after Timothy Olyphant star of 2007s ""Hitman"" refused to participate in a sequel and proclaimed that he only signed up for the first installment because he needed to pay his mortgage. Rupert Friend (""Homeland"") takes over from Olyphant as the franchises lead but it hardly makes a difference. The genetically engineered Agent 47 bred and trained to be a ""perfect killing machine"" isnt more than a shaved head a raised tattoo of a barcode on the back of his skull and an absurdly conspicuous Santa-red tie. Hes so devoid of humanity let alone a personality that he sits upright on the sofa while waiting for his laptop to complete an hours-long search through a database. At night he simply closes his eyes and wills himself to fall asleep instantaneously; he powers down faster than my smartphone. Also Read Will Pixels Fall Victim to the Video Game Movie Curse? The plot is a weightless tangle. As a voiceover introduction explains Agent 47 was one of several super-assassins who fled the organization that created them. After the destruction of that org a new corporation has emerged to create a new army of mutant mercenaries. It needs either to coerce the original scientist (Ciaran Hinds) who created the Agents to replicate his experiment or to extract the best of his findings from his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware ABCs ""Betrayal"") a possibly psychic woman who holds the key to her fathers research in her genes. While Katia searches for her father 47 and a rival agent (Zachary Quinto) race to find her first. Agent 47 lacks the ability to feel pain and remorse -- emotions that would get in the way of his trigger finger -- while Katia is burdened by the constant fear that comes with her Spider Senses. First-time director Aleksander Bachs major misstep -- which he takes over and over -- lies in presuming that those two who eventually join forces have psychologies worth exploring. Also Read Minecraft Movie to Be Directed by Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia Star Rob McElhenney With one foot in a slick Berlin and the other in a futuristic Singapore the film offers reasonably diverting amusement in the form of death by bullet vertebrae snap and wind turbine with each new mortality leveling up in creativity and improbability. Most of these nearly bloodless killings are neat efficient and about as eventful as a stapler going about its business. (Agent 47s sweatless ease must save him a fortune at the dry cleaners.) Bach is so generous with slo-mo that theres even a drawn-out scene of Katia pulling her hair up into a ponytail. Most frustratingly though too many scenes devoted to Agent 47 and Katias paper-thin backstories or damaged minds tend toward the unbearably long and vapid. Neither Bach nor writers Skip Woods and Michael Finch are actually interested in what it means to be denied access to emotions the rest of us depend on (or cant escape from). They bring up the same questions over and over again yet never bother to answer them. Also Read 7 Questions With Homeland Star Rupert Friend Emmy Contender Quickie Theres a fun enough action sequence where Agent 47 teaches Katia the tricks of the junior assassin while sneaking up on baddies together and pulverizing them with random gizmos in an industrial warehouse. (That wind turbine is just the beginning.) We later discover that Katia is essentially an improved version of her new mentor but she then spends the rest of the film getting rescued when shes not undressing or swimming or lingering in the shower. Unfortunately that sacrifice of any originality -- to the point of throwing internal logic out the window -- is the modus operandi governing Bachs film. For all its cheap talk about the importance of innovation ""Agent 47"" just feels like a copy of a copy of a copy. Email 11 Horrible Video Game Adaptations Before Pixels (Video) ""Super Mario Bros."" (1993) Box Office 20.9 million. Mario himself Bob Hoskins has not only called this movie the worst job hes ever had but its also the biggest disappointment AND regret of his career. ) ""Double Dragon"" (1994) Box Office 2.34 million. In this wildly-inaccurate vision of 2007 the fate of a crappy city called ""New Angeles"" (L.A. and San Diego combined) will be decided by an ancient Chinese medallion that alcoholic sibling on ""Party of Five"" and the T-1000 from ""Terminator 2 Judgement Day."" If the trailer doesnt scare you away its currently streaming on Netflix. ) ""Street Fighter"" (1994) Box Office 99.4 million. The goofy Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie nearly tripled its 35 million budget internationally but it was universally panned by critics. Perhaps the biggest flaw was the eventual appearance of fan favorite character Blanka -- a ferocious beast in the game who just looked like a poorly-costumed actor in the movie. ) ""Wing Commander"" (1999) Box Office 11.57 million. This movie bombed in theaters and was booed by critics. But at least this Freddy Prinze Jr. movie really really REALLY makes you appreciate ""Star Wars."" Even the prequels. ) ""House of the Dead"" (2003) Box Office 13.8 million. In this zombie video game adaptations defense it landed in theaters years before the publics hunger for the walking dead began. And it was directed by Uwe Boll. ) ""Alone in the Dark"" (2005) Box Office 10.4 million. The video game helped set the standard for survival horror while the movie set the standard for the rest of Tara Reids career. Uwe Boll was charged with bringing this to the big screen as well. ) ""Doom"" (2005) Box Office 55.98 million. Before The Rock was box office viagra he starred opposite Karl Urban in this 60 million first-person shooter adaptation that went limp at the box office. ) ""DOA Dead or Alive"" (2006) Box Office 7.5 million. What happens when Eric Roberts rounds up a bunch of hot fighter chicks to fight for a 10 million prize ""any time anywhere""? Nothing good. ) ""In the Name of the King A Dungeon Siege Tale"" (2008) Box Office 13 million. Jason Statham Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds may have thought they were starring in the next ""Lord of the Rings""-style fantasy epic (or they just needed a paycheck). But in reality this adaptation of Microsoft role-playing game ""Dungeon Siege"" was just the next Uwe Boll bomb. ) ""Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li"" (2009) Box Office 12.7 million (2009). Hopes for some kind of redemption for the beloved Capcom fighting game -- or a Chris Klein comeback -- were immediately dashed when this ""Street Fighter"" got a beating from critics. ) ""Need for Speed"" (2014) Box Office 43.6 million. In his first lead big-screen role post-""Breaking Bad"" Aaron Paul failed to rev up audiences playing a street racer who joins a cross-country race with revenge in mind.
