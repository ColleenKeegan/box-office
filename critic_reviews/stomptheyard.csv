Actor George Chakiris (far right) in the 1961 film West Side Story. United Artists/Courtesy Getty Images i Just Us Guys A stomp dance crew in Stomp the Yard. hide caption toggle caption Just Us Guys A stomp dance crew in Stomp the Yard. If you want to see some dancing you might check out the new movie Stomp the Yard. As the movie starts some very scary-looking guys are hurling themselves at each other in a nightclub. Their moves are aggressive threatening ferocious and always stop just short of the glowering guys theyre aimed at. It turns out its a competition. Now watching these young men dancing -- and especially after one of them is killed a few moments later in a rumble -- I couldnt help thinking of some other gang members dancing on screen a half-century ago. They called themselves Jets and Sharks and their music was also percussive but in a jazzy symphonic way. Though the gang members in West Side Story now look sweetly clean-cut back then they seemed pretty tough -- far tougher than say Fred Astaire. ""Tough guys dont dance"" claimed Norman Mailer in a book title but every generation in Hollywood wants to at least let them try. The trick is finding a reason. In the 1940s studios did it through casting taking machine-gun-toting Jimmy Cagney and turning him into machine-gun-tapping George M. Cohan. Of course in Yankee Doodle Dandy Cagney wasnt actually playing a tough guy and if hed done it a few more times his gangster credentials would have lapsed. Happily once the ice was broken Hollywood had no problem just letting gangsters dance as gangsters in Guys and Dolls for instance. Everyone danced in the movies in the 1950s so tough guys didnt have to make excuses. There were dancing backwoodsmen in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers dancing convicts in Jailhouse Rock even a dancing Asian tyrant in The King and I. After movie musicals went out of fashion in the 1960s producers had to come up with new reasons for their macho stars to stomp. They got pretty clever about it turning dance into a competitive sport in Saturday Night Fever with John Travolta working the disco the way Rocky worked the ring and setting rebellious teenagers to defying puritanical town fathers in Footloose. But after Michael Jacksons music video for ""Beat It"" pushed this notion about as far as it could go the variations got pretty lame. At which point Hollywood ceded the dance floor to Hong Kong for a bit as martial arts movies got more and more ""choreographed."" Eventually folks like Jackie Chan werent so much involved in combat as in aerial ballets flying on wires and tiptoeing across treetops and this form too seemed to be running its course. But it had added something to the mix -- something that ballet companies always push in their advertising -- muscles on display. The Footloose generations skinny teen rebels had been replaced by shirtless macho fighters who looked dangerous. And that aesthetic also drives the ""hotshot-versus-the-group"" movies that have come along in the last couple of years Drumline about a show-boating recruit to a marching band and now Stomp the Yard about a cocky young stepper who brings urban moves to a form he finds too tame. The plots may be straight out of those college musicals that used to star June Allyson and Peter Lawford but they sure look different. Shot in flash-cut music-video-style with lots of editing tricks the choreographed challenges and insults look ferocious. And why shouldnt they? Hollywood has been choreographing violence since Jimmy Cagney was dying in bullet ballets. Car chases boxing matches armies charging down hillsides starships hurtling through space. Tough guys do dance -- theyve always danced with props -- as long as its ""dirty"" dancing. Its just cleaner when its just with attitude.

(The final writer of record is Robert Adetuyi preceded by Gregory Ramon Anderson.) Yet theres no sign of any screenplay whatsoever for the first few manic deafening minutes of the film. Images and music are all. Inner-city Los Angeles. A street-dancing contest. Young dancers gyrating wildly. (You might also say wonderfully except for the madly speeded up camera work.) Yelling. Cheering. Twirling. One dancer rotates upside down skull on sidewalk. Glad faces. Mad faces. Motorcycle noise. Baleful orange light. Rival dancers fight. Gunshots. A boy is dead. Only then does a conventional plot about step dancing kick in -- conventional enough in its dogged way to make you yearn for a little chaos. ENLARGE In Step Columbus Short (left) and Shaffer ""Ne-Yo"" Smith (center) in ""Stomp the Yard."" Step dancing or stepping is a form of street dancing that has evolved into a cross between Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Marine Corps basic training. The moves can be remarkable though ritually repetitive -- male chorus lines of adrenalized automata acting out anger menace pride audacity or joy. And ""Stomp the Yard"" which was directed by Sylvain White is absolutely fixated by step dancing. The troubled young hero a street-wise dancer named DJ (an appealing performance by Columbus Short) has lost his kid brother in that prefatory fight. To avoid being sent to juvenile hall for his role in the melee he enrolls reluctantly in Truth University an ostensibly prestigious African-American school in Atlanta that seems to be an institution of higher stepping since no learning is in evidence. (The school is fictional but Untruth University wouldnt have sounded right.) Truth U.s life is organized around Greek fraternities which are organized around stepping contests. ""Being in a fraternity is about a lot more than just stepping"" DJ is told by April (Meagan Good) the temporarily unattainable girl of his dreams but she is wrong. Stepping is everything in ""Stomp the Yard"" and dare I say it a stepping stone to DJs redemption. The movie itself is redeemed -- slightly -- by its almost touching devotion to the hoary Hollywood traditions of college movies with battling frats as well as its earnest endorsement of education. Truth U.s Heritage Hall built in 1873 displays photos of Martin Luther King Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks with a prominence that suggests they were alumni. No info is offered on whether they stepped. God Grew Tired of Us Two unimaginable journeys become more than imaginable in ""God Grew Tired Of Us"" a documentary by Christopher Quinn and Tommy Walker -- the movie makes them vivid and memorable. This is a film that adds to our understanding of human nature. Yet its impact is lessened by a lack of factual context and by an inspirational climax that may leave one feeling good and uneasy in equal measure. The first of those journeys recapitulated with archival footage and narrated by Nicole Kidman is that of the so-called Lost Boys of Sudan. They were 25000 innocents orphaned by Sudans savage civil war who fled their villages in the 1980s and wandered sub-Saharan Africa on foot for five years before reaching a United Nations refugee camp in Kenya. (More than half of them died along the way victims of sickness and starvation.) On the other journey the camera follows three of those camp dwellers no longer boys but grown men (and English-speaking Christians) as they are relocated to the United States -- two in Pittsburgh one in Syracuse. Part of the fascination is inevitably watching fish out of water. The world travelers -- all three of them dazzlingly affable -- penetrate mystery after mystery airplanes light switches running water toilets potato chips ice skating Santa Claus supermarkets that seem as vast if not as warm as African savannahs. More fascinating still is why they do what they do and how they feel about their new lives. After many months in new apartments the refugees still eat with their fingers. Because they cant adapt? No because finger food is part of the culture they cling to quite consciously for spiritual nourishment. ""A person without culture"" one of them explains ""is like a farmer without land."" Their irretrievable losses -- the makeshift families of the long march -- leave them feeling haunted sometimes hopeless and terribly vulnerable to loneliness. You can take the boy out of the country but you cant take the sorrow out of the boy. Where the film grows vexing is in its vagueness about the size and nature of the resettlement effort. How many young men were brought here? What were the selection criteria? How big a dent does it make in the refugee problem? No answers are provided. And the film comes uncomfortably close to TV cliche -- the Make-A-Wish syndrome strikes again -- when one of the men is reunited with his mother. The moment is shattering heaven knows. Deplaning in Syracuse the woman collapses at her sons feet then ululates piercingly and prances joyfully down the airport corridor. But the scene bespeaks a media conundrum -- how to focus public attention on vast social upheavals without turning them into grist for the entertainment mill?    DVD tip An earlier documentary ""Lost Boys Of Sudan"" (2003) follows two other Sudanese refugees to new homes in suburban America. The photography is less resplendent -- or seductive -- in this film and theres no narration but powerful feelings are evoked all the same. Megan Mylan directed with Jon Shenk who also did the cinematography.

"Stomp the Yard Out of step | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesStomp the Yard Out of stepWhen DJs brother gets killed in an outbreak of violence during an L.A. street dance contest the boy is sent to live with his straight-laced relatives in Atlanta and enrolled in the all-black Truth University.By Susan WalkerENTERTAINMENT REPORTERFri. Jan. 12 2007  (out of 4)   Article Continued BelowWhen DJs brother gets killed in an outbreak of violence during an L.A. street dance contest the boy is sent to live with his straight-laced relatives in Atlanta and enrolled in the all-black Truth University. DJ (Columbus Short) is hurting and hes out of place and initially wants no part of the extremely rivalrous competition between campus fraternities for the ""stepping"" championships.Stepping by the way is an arcane form of dance derived from African gumboot dancing and resembles a form of male cheerleading. There are a lot of reasons why Stomp the Yard feels out of place out of time and overburdened with messages about self-respect starting with the idea of a college fraternity being a happening kind of organization.DJs better instincts lead him to the beautiful April (Meagan Good) whose boyfriend Grant (Darrin Henson) is the star stepper on the champion Mu Gamma Xi team. Whether its to get the girl or defeat her boyfriend DJ joins the rival Theta Nu Theta fraternity and leads them to victory with his street styles.Apparently such contests actually take place. Perhaps director Sylvain White hoped that this laughably melodramatic film might find its way into the pantheon of urban dance films. But seen against such films as Rize and You Got Served its a step in the wrong direction.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Columbus Short Meagan Good Darrin Henson and Brian J. White. Directed by Sylvain White. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Anybody who needs a full 115 minutes to win the girl and the contest doesnt deserve either. Modern life requires decisiveness and provides fewer obstacles in terms of transportation and mores. This is not 1800 or even 1900 when people had to be careful about what they said and when courting and socializing were associated with elaborate ritual. Thus if youre making a movie about college students you should do it in less time than ""Mansfield Park"" (112 minutes) and ""Wings of the Dove"" (102 minutes). You should not be taking longer than Jane Austen and Henry James. [Podcast Mick LaSalle on ""Absolute Wilson"" ""Stomp the Yard"" and ""Pans Labyrinth.""] ""Stomp the Yard"" at nearly two hours has a decent story a good subject and a horrible plot. (Since many people think of story and plot as synonymous a plot is the arrangement of incidents by which the story is told.) The film introduces too many elements doubles back on itself repeats and repeats the same information starts and stops includes needless tangential riffs finds artificial means to stretch the running length (as though that were desirable) and is in every way a completely flabby mess. But the charm of the actors and the intrinsic appeal of the subject matter make it possible to watch it without falling asleep or screaming. The picture concerns a tradition maintained by African American fraternities in the South of staging elaborate choreographed ""stepping"" routines on the campus common areas. Stepping consists of regimented movement mixing shout-outs hand clapping and knee slapping and the movie almost captures the fun of seeing a live stepping demonstration. It certainly captures the reaction of students to stepping All other activity comes to a halt and everybody watches delighted. But before the movie can get to where it wants to go -- college -- theres a prologue in which our hero DJ (Columbus Short) and his group of street dancers win a dance competition at a Los Angeles nightclub. Typical of the movies pace they dont win by dancing once but by doing two elaborate routines which means that the other side also does two elaborate routines. At the end of this the other side is perturbed about losing so theres a street fight and DJs brother is killed. Then DJ goes to college to a fictional university close to Atlanta. DJ is from the hood and many of the other kids are from upper-middle-class families and so while DJ tends the grounds -- as part of a work-study program -- other kids are living in frat houses. Given DJs dance background it would have been natural for the screenwriters to have him be immediately attracted to stepping but they choose to make him passive instead. He uses his dance steps only to impress a girl (Meagan Good) and he gets involved in a fraternity only after being coaxed. Coaxing like passivity eats up time. Director Sylvain White is an artist of the punch-the-camera school of filming. Whenever theres the first hint of excitement the camera goes crazy as though Ruby just shot Oswald and the cameraman cant believe it. But whos the subjective camera in the case of ""Stomp the Yard?"" That is who is the person watching whose excitement is being simulated by all this ridiculous shaking? Its not the viewer. Were not excited. Its not the observers. Theyre not excited. Its not the participants because their point of view is right in the midst of the action. And if its supposed to be the filmmaker -- well he ought to calm down. The truth is this shaking quaking camera is in fact a faking camera in that it provides the subjective psychological viewpoint of a person who does not exist. The actors have to contend with all of this. So do the stepping sequences. Everyone survives sort of. Theres no doubting Meagan Good and Columbus Short even when the script requires them to indicate emotions and say things they wouldnt. They have enough integrity to maintain an audiences attention and elevate this clumsy movie into a break-even proposition. -- Advisory This film contains an episode of violence.

With Columbus Short Meagan Good. Director Sylvain White (149). PG-13 Violence sexuality language. At area theaters. While old-school steps make way for bold new moves in Sylvain Whites urban dance drama the story itself is dangerously close to being played out. Aside from some dazzling choreography theres little here that we havent seen before. Columbus Short stars as DJ a cocky kid whose life changes when his brother is murdered after a dangerously high-stakes dance challenge. (If youre looking for realism go rent David LaChapelles inner-city dance doc ""Rize."" If youre happiest in the land of Michael Jacksons ""Beat It"" video keep reading.) To make his grieving mom happy DJ leaves the L.A. ghetto and heads for leafy Atlanta where hes been accepted as a freshman at all-black Truth University. He definitely doesnt fit in Within hours hes insulted the leaders of the two biggest fraternities during the schools first ""stepping"" battle. Still his hip-hop style is just what the Theta Nu brothers need to update their traditional moves so he reluctantly agrees to help them win the Annual Step Championships. But complications as you may have guessed shortly ensue. For one thing DJ angers the dean by pursuing his daughter April (a nicely sensible Meagan Good); for another he angers Aprils boyfriend Grant (Darrin Henson) who just happens to be the head of Theta Nus rival fraternity. So yes the story is bland and predictable and disappointing. But heres the thing about dance movies (or cheerleading movies or even marching band movies) All that really matters is the action. Sure it would be great if White gave us a hero worth rooting for or a script that surprised us. He doesnt. What we do get is scene after scene of exhilarating routines all leading up to the big finale. And with two furiously intense teams ready to dance each other off the stage its an absolute winner. Even if you have already guessed who wins. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

After all director Sylvain Whites sometimes rousing celebration of the African-American tradition of ""stepping"" isnt meant to extol the dubious thrills of the gangsta life. At least not once it relocates DJ (Columbus Short) from Los Angeles to a historically black college in Atlanta. Yet like too many redemption tales pitched at the so-called ""urban market"" the movie has trouble shaking off its own attachment to testosterone-fueled volatility. It succumbs to the need to prove with visual pyrotechnics its street cred. So early on tempers flare. Someone gets ""disrespected."" A gun comes out of a waistband. A young man dies. In a contest similar to the emcee showdowns in ""8 Mile"" DJ brother Duron and friends take on the reigning badboys at an L.A. event. What they perform can be likened to personification of ""the dozens"" - that storied African-American tradition of verbal insult. Consider it dance as reined-in but highly inventive antagonism. Against Durons advice DJ ups the ante humiliating a Latino gangbanger in the process. Tragedy ensues. DJ leaves for Atlanta and the discipline of his middle-class uncle and aunt. At fictional Truth University the hardheaded but decent-hearted young man becomes entangled in the rivalry of two African-American Greek societies the Mu Gammas and the Theta Nu Thetas. The Mu Gammas are national step champs full of themselves and populated by future investment bankers. The Thetas led by Sylvester (Brian White of ""Brick"") are more thoughtful about brotherhood and service (OK that last ones only hinted at which is part of the movies problem). Meagan Good plays DJs love interest April. Shes curvy brainy and uh-oh the provosts daughter and Mu Gamma snob Grants squeeze. Good - who has had better (""Eves Bayou"") similar (""Roll Bounce"") and worse material (""Waist Deep"") - is starting to tempt typecasting with this role. The script forces Short to telegraph too much. DJs version of lust at first sight is strictly juvenile. The story hurries when taking its time would have given it emotional heft. Theres enough material about black campuses to provide insights to newbies or audiences that didnt see 2002s ""Drumline"" about marching-band throwdowns at the same schools. Yet for a pricklier portrayal of black college life Spike Lees quasi-musical ""School Daze"" is still the right thing. And for a more generous tutorial on the style of dancing DJ does at the outset of the movie rent David LaChapelles 2005 ""Rize."" Yes you can build a Netflix list with these better films because ""Stomp the Yard"" isnt quite good enough. Like ""Bring It On"" ""Drumline"" and any number of the ""Save the Last Dance"" knockoffs - the films makers get just how rich even ecstatic these subcultures of movement can be. Its aggravating then to see how easily they trip up that vitality with uninspired storytelling. When DJ doesnt get the significance of Greeks April sends him to Heritage Hall. There he sees photos of a roster of African-Americans whod been in Greek societies including Martin Luther King Jr. Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King. Its a suggestive shout out to both the films - and the frats - loftier yet not-quite-realized ambitions.

"An old dance with some smooth steps - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW An old dance with some smooth steps Columbus Short plays scholarship kid DJ and Meagan Good is the provosts daughter April in ""Stomp the Yard."" (Alfeo Dixon/Screen Gems) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 12 2007 ""Stomp the Yard"" is a vigorous college cheerleading movie with pumped fists instead of pom-poms. The white skin has been replaced with all kinds of creams caramels and cocoas.Our setting is one of Atlantas prestigious historically black universities albeit a fictitious one and our newcomer is DJ (Columbus Short) a scholarship kid fresh from Los Angeles streets that more or less took his brother a dancer for sport like himself. He doesnt want to be there but like I said this is a college cheerleading movie and the movie is cheerleading for college.After the schools two rival fraternities get a load of DJs dance movies -- a little krump a little Savion Glover some hydraulics -- they both attempt to recruit him to step for them. Stepping is a dance that requires discipline and team showboating not the buck-wild solo stuff hes used to. It also means time away from his studies and his campus job doing grounds keeping chores for his unsmiling uncle (Harry J. Lennix).And why conform to the black Greek system anyway? One gander at the wall of fame in the schools all-purpose heritage hall corrects his ignorance Esther Rolle Rosa Parks Coretta Scott King her husband Martin. Soon DJ pledges and the fictional outfit he chooses Theta Nu Theta -- a.k.a. the Vipers a.k.a. TNT a.k.a. his background dancers -- has six weeks to prepare for the nation al step competition.Im a sucker for a movie that mixes suds with sweat. So I was pleased to see that DJ on registration day is stopped as so many men in B-movies before him have been by the vision of Meagan Good  whos as teasingly luscious as ever. Naturally shes the girlfriend of the egomaniac in the rival fraternity whos played by the pop-music choreographer Darrin Henson . (We can tell hes the villain; a lot of his moves are old Britney Spears routines.) In any case Good is also the provosts daughter which is what the movie should have been called. And daddy dont like no thug even one as cute limber and personably un-thug-like as DJ.This is the screenwriter Robert Adetuyis second movie in a week. At some megaplexes his ""Code Name The Cleaner"" is stinking up the house next door. ""Stomp the Yard"" which Sylvain White directed has a lot more to observe -- and not just the way Good manages to jog on concrete like a ""Baywatch"" girl although that is fascinating.This is the first movie since Spike Lees ""School Daze"" to even consider the social complexities of black college life and Lees film was almost 20 years ago. Granted a lot of what ""Stomp the Yard"" considers complicated is daytime-TV stuff (secrets lies tears Keith Sweat as a competition judge). But the movie does afford Lennix the suave Valarie Pettiford  as his wife and Brian White  as the Thetas dignified leader the chance to enliven the proceedings with elegance.The raucous dancing meanwhile is where most of the drama is. The girls in the movie theater screamed when it start ed . They also screamed at every shirtless training sequence and when something bad happen ed to the singer Chris Brown who has a small part. The movie doubles as a hormonal horror show. For his part Short another pop choreographer sounds like Vin Diesel but he moves like a bee. When he dances he makes sure every girl in the theater goes home stung.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

"Stomp the Yard The Storys in the Stepping washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Stomp the Yard The Storys in the Stepping The dancing in ""Stomp the Yard"" shows remarkable grace and power. (By Alfeo Dixon -- Screen Gems Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 12 2007 ""Stomp the Yard"" has one great thing about it. That thing its best thing its only thing its cool thing is its sense of rhythmic percussion. If you ever saw the novelty musical ""Stomp"" or have heard Alan Lomaxs collection of Parchman Farm chain gang songs from the 40s youll get down with it. Its script must have read Boomlay boomlay boomlay BOOM Its really two movies. The first and most forgettable is the much-told old story about a young man finding himself and becoming somebody. The young man is an L.A. street dancer named DJ well played by charisma merchant Columbus Short. When at an underground dance contest heavy on intimidation and aggression he and his brother trump some gang-related dancers trouble breaks out the brother (Chris Brown) is killed and DJ is arrested. Its juvey or through connections off to college. How big a no-brainer is that? At college -- Truth University in the film a historically black institution in Atlanta -- his talents get him noticed even as hes noticing a beautiful young woman April (Meagan Good whom you will go home and dream about after seeing this film just my prediction). He finally decides to commit to a team sport and as an athlete finds the respect the brotherhood the emotional completion that has been denied him by circumstance and pathology. He leads the team to the nationals. Ho-hum. But the sport isnt basketball or football or anything like that Its stepping. And thats the second movie in ""Stomp the Yard."" If youve never seen stepping its quite a show and the film throws well-deserved light on this somewhat under-the-radar phenomenon at least outside African American fraternities. ""Stepping"" will also be familiar to anyone who served in the old Army before KP was outsourced to minimum-wage contract workers. In that army it was called ""close order drill"" and the military function of it is the same as the fraternitys function to take a bunch of uninterested young men and turn them into a cohesive unit quickly in complete rhythm achieving precision beauty and success. There is no I in close-order drill -- or in stepping. (It helped -- this was my downfall in the Army -- if you knew your left foot from your right.) At any rate with his natural choreographic skills DJ is a superb stepper and quickly becomes a leader in frat house culture. Short is a professional choreographer and his dancing seems unstuck in time. How he can break his movements down to such small elements keep them so precise and in such rigorous rhythm yet remain on track and moving forward with Nureyevs beauty and discipline is something to see. And the stepping on-screen though possibly inflated by movie magic to Vegas-style proportions (the final step-off at the ""nationals"" could go onstage at Caesars Palace) is nevertheless equally riveting. Its charismatic movement like samurai sword fighting or deep pass catching; you marvel that anyone could get so much grace and power out of his body. Stomp the Yard (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for adult themes violence some sexual material and profanity.

""Stomp"" should get its B.O. groove on in urban markets if earlier dance-themed hits are any indication. The dancing is more dynamic than the plotting in ""Stomp the Yard"" an energetic if formulaic underdog tale about warring black fraternities specializing in an intensely competitive style of step dancing. Enjoyable youth-skewing fare executes its predictable moves with plenty of visual-aural panache only to get tripped up by some decidedly un-hip twists in the third act. Still ""Stomp"" should get its B.O. groove on in urban markets if earlier dance-themed hits like ""Step Up"" and ""You Got Served"" (also from Screen Gems) are any indication. Furiously hyperkinetic prologue shows cocky Los Angeles native DJ (Columbus Short) and his posse winning a bout of competitive street dancing with their daring acrobatics and insanely fast rhythms. After the thunderous backbeats have subsided however the night takes a tragic turn when a gang of rival dancers jumps DJ and guns down his brother (Chris Brown). Arrested for his role in the violent clash DJ avoids juvenile hall by getting shipped off to Atlanta where his tough-love uncle (Harry Lennix) enrolls him at Truth U. a historic predominantly African-American institution. The troubled freshman immediately gets off on the wrong foot with popular upperclassman Grant (Darrin Henson) -- a member of Truths dominant fraternity Mu Gamma Xi -- by flirting with his girlfriend April (Meagan Good). Soon DJs show-offy attitude and unmistakable prowess on the dance floor draw the attention of the other frat on campus Theta Nu Theta which has been overshadowed by Mu Gamma at the national stepping championship for the past seven years. From there the storys trajectory could hardly be more predictable -- DJ must get schooled get hazed and of course get the girl and the trophy while dealing with his repressed grief and learning the meaning of teamwork. (Call it ""Good Will Stomping."") Learning being a two-way street however Theta Nu also benefits from DJs ""street"" background incorporating his cool ghetto stylings into their traditional dance routines. Pic continually contrasts tough urban DJ with his invariably smug and wealthy adversaries -- and to that end Robert Adetuyis screenplay goes out of its way to cast preppy Grant and even Aprils father the school provost (Allan Louis) as two-dimensional villains. Scripts excessive dramatic convolutions -- all rigged to make DJ look as vulnerable and put-upon as possible -- prove especially groan-worthy as the climactic dance competition approaches. Fortunately Shorts moody taciturn DJ is easy enough to root for on his own while Brian White also shows sparks of charisma in the slender role of an older Theta Nu brother. Good is well good as usual even if she is playing just another coveted trophy one whose every sultry movement -- whether bending over a water fountain or jogging in hot-pink track gear -- is ogled by the camera in hilarious slow-mo. Though some presumably important details of DJs college life are either relegated to montage or left out altogether (at no point does the camera venture near a lecture hall) helmer Sylvain Whites background in commercials and musicvideos serves him ably enough in the invigorating dance sequences. Lenser Scott Kevan wisely dispenses with the irritatingly sped-up camerawork used in the opening sequence and instead shoots the dancers impressive moves in real time at times flooding the screen with wildly oversaturated colors. Editing for the most part works in conjunction with the bass-heavy hip-hop soundtrack but the cutting is often still too frenetic proving unnecessarily competitive with Dave Scotts athletic and nimble choreography.

Posted January 10 2007 -- 1200 AM EST The latest arcane MTV-icized group activity to receive the loud busy generic music-video treatment is stepping a choreographic tradition of Greek campus life at black universities. In Stomp the Yard one handsome former L.A. tough (Columbus Short) finds his feet -- and a welcome reason to take off his shirt -- among other similarly shirtless-worthy Atlanta fraternity brothers. The shallow frat-on-frat rivalry and the poor-boy-loves-rich-girl subplot dont mean a thing. But the stepping does got that swing.
