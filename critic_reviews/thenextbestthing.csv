More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Starring Madonna and Rupert Everett. Directed by John Schlesinger. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 107 minutes.) Fortitude and enterprise are important qualities for anyone who yearns to be a movie star but as Madonna keeps demonstrating they arent everything. ""The Next Best Thing"" is the pop stars latest attempt to prove her acting chops. Playing a Los Angeles yoga instructor who has a baby with her gay best friend (Rupert Everett) Madonna is adequate but not much more. Its a surprisingly low- key performance and not the kind of role we associate with Madonna. Vulnerable hungry for affection good- humored but not particularly catty Abbie is a longtime loser in love who decides in the absence of her dream mate that having a baby with her best friend is ""the next best thing."" Lucky for her Madonna has Everett to play off a frequently witty script by Tom Ropelewski and the warm direction of veteran filmmaker John Schlesinger. Madonna gives a performance that lacks all the qualities we like best in her. Instead of wit chutzpah and panache we get a colorless woman who turns weepy and whiny. Madonnas best moments are with Everett -- they have a nice teasing rapport -- and with Malcolm Stumpf the young actor who plays her 5-year-old son. ""The Next Best Thing"" is really two movies the first a light comedy climaxing the night Abbie and Robert (Everett) get wildly drunk and accidentally conceive a child; the second a child-custody drama thats triggered by Abbies romance with Ben a seemingly perfect man played by Benjamin Bratt. Thats a few too many agendas for one film. When Abbie hooks up with Ben and then turns on Robert because hes acting jealous and threatened the transition from soul mate to adversary is too abrupt. The writing is part of the problem here but so is Madonna She doesnt seem capable of registering conflicting emotions. The comic moments are so much better that one wishes Schlesinger had canned the drama and turned out a merry sex farce. Everett is wonderfully funny when he needs to be but the movie never figures out how to let him be both a father and a sexually active man. ..

Im talking of course about Hollywoods latest stock scenario in which a gay guy and a hetero gal match wits as a fabulously odd couple. The town cant stop cloning the idea thanks to the appeal Julia Roberts exuded opposite the equally appealing Rupert Everett in My Best Friends Wedding. The territory has been reworked with varying results in The Object of My Affection with Jennifer Aniston playing an improbably unattached pregnant woman longing for her gay best buddy and the NBC comedy Will amp; Grace where the titular just-bitchy-pals couple is so colorless the show should be handed over to their sidekicks and retitled Jack amp; Karen. In the newest and certainly flimsiest branch of this post- nuclear-family tree The Next Best Thing Everett stars as a cattier less elegant version of the best friend he played in Wedding. Hes Robert a perfectly chiseled landscaper whom were supposed to believe cant even conceive of having a meaningful relationship with another man. Instead he finds fulfillment after he gets tipsy and accidentally fathers a son with the serially single Abbie (Madonna). The drunken buildup to their fateful sex act full of wince-inducing pratfalls as they topple and smash the belongings of the fastidious gay couple whose house theyre swanning around in plays like a strange homage to 1930s musicals. And like the leading lady in some 40s tearjerker Robert gives up the trappings of what he considers an oh-so-empty lifestyle to help raise little Sam (charming newcomer Malcolm Stumpf) only to end up in a nasty custody battle once Abbie gets engaged to a hunky businessman (a suave Benjamin Bratt). While Everetts charm almost carries the climactic rambling plea for single gay dads rights -- one of several Kramer vs. Kramer tacks taken by screenwriter Tom Ropelewski (Look Whos Talking Now) -- Madonna fails to flesh out her character in the slightest. She plays a yoga instructor natch and so has lots of opportunities to show off just how effortlessly she can contort her disciplined body into pretzel poses. Director John Schlesinger a long way from his late-60s career highs of Darling and Midnight Cowboy dutifully frames her figure in many an admiring long shot. But when he comes in for gauzy close-ups Madonna can barely muster even the rudiments of human expression. Whether shes laughing crying or in her best scene wistfully assaying herself in a mirror as she pulls her breasts and her eyes taut against signs of aging (""1989"" she says then ""1999"" as she lets go) her face remains a hapless blank.
