Comments Bringing Out the Dead Rated R  121 minutes  2014 A conscientious NYC paramedic (Nicolas Cage) has lost a patient whose image continues to haunt him in this seminarrative plotted as a series of calls he answers with a series of partners (John Goodman Ving Rhames Tom Sizemore). A kind of revisionist Taxi Driver-After Hours-Leaving Las Vegas the movie draws genre allusions specific references a range of styles and several haltingly linear story lines into a maelstrom. Its hard-to-pin-down tone is frighteningly original--simultaneously world-weary and adolescent with an aura of perpetual anxiety as if the characters and filmmakers were in pursuit of a catharsis everyone knows will never come. The movie systematically generates enigmas as it attacks many of lifes deepest questions--sometimes literally through Cages portentous voice-overs sometimes suggestively through the startling combination of physical elements within a given shot or scene. The pop tunes that make up a significant part of the sound track as in many other movies directed by Martin Scorsese are often slow paced by 90s standards; its a distinctively middle-aged edginess that dominates the hyperbolically gory morbid schmaltzy paranoid-surreal text--a text that provokes thought more than directs it which should fascinate viewers for a long time. The screenplay by Paul Schrader was based on a novel by Joe Connelly. With Patricia Arquette Marc Anthony and Cliff Curtis.

Its a quintessential New York nocturnal tale of the occupational hazards joys and sorrows of a paramedic splendidly played by Nicolas Cage as he ""routinely"" goes about his job of saving peoples lives. Dark humor visual pyrotechnics and bravura acting help make more palatable a movie thats intense and full of gory details. In a radical departure from his last picture ""Kundun"" a historical epic that was basically an arthouse film Martin Scorsese teams for the fourth time with scripter Paul Schrader for ""Bringing Out the Dead."" In many significant ways pic recalls their first collaboration ""Taxi Driver."" Based on Joe Connellys pulp novel its a quintessential New York nocturnal tale of the occupational hazards joys and sorrows of a paramedic splendidly played by Nicolas Cage as he ""routinely"" goes about his job of saving peoples lives. Dark humor amusing moments visual pyrotechnics and bravura acting from the entire ensemble help make more palatable a movie thats intense and full of gory details and which mainstream viewers might not find appealing or entertaining. Domestic distrib Paramount should expect a moderate theatrical run likely in the underwhelming B.O. vicinity of Scorseses ""Casino."" The British director Michael Powell once fondly described Scorsese as ""the Goya of Tenth Avenue"" a label that perfectly applies to his new effort. Though not as resonant or brilliant as his landmark New York trilogy (""Mean Streets"" ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"") ""Bringing Out the Dead"" is a decent well-made movie that displays admirable balance among the dramatic comic and absurdist elements that define paramedics highly demanding jobs. Schrader whose last script for Scorsese was ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" improves on the source material a dense stream-of-consciousness account based on Connellys experience as an ambulance driver. More shapely than the book from a dramatic standpoint the taut script is punctuated by much-needed romantic and comedic interludes that modulate whats fundamentally a hysterical if dynamic and vibrant yarn epitomized by a speeding ambulance as it charges from one pressing assignment to another. Quite effectively Schrader reduces the novels first-person narration to a minimum and eliminates its heavy religious symbolism. Though this is a more mature work critics will likely perceive it as ""Taxi Driver"" a generation later and not only because of the protagonists similar professions. Like the earlier films Travis Bickle Frank Pierce (Cage) is a man on the edge an insomniac loner who works the graveyard shift and in the midst of his works hustle and bustle undergoes a severe spiritual crisis that may lead to either self-destruction or redemption two motifs that run throughout Scorseses three-decade oeuvre. There are also echoes of Scorseses ""After Hours"" Like that 1985 noir comedy new pic is a nocturnal journey structured in terms of brief encounters that progressively get more desperate and hilarious. Story is set in the early 1990s when New York Citys Emergency Medical Service was in disorder; in 1996 EMS was put under the jurisdiction of the fire department which introduced some organizational improvements. This background conveys the chaos and wilderness in which Frank and his associates operate urgent calls heavy traffic with screaming sirens and flashing lights overcrowded hospitals hysterical victims. The streets are populated with pimps and prostitutes of various colors drug dealers crackheads homeless people innocent pedestrians arguing Russians and religious Jews. The film follows Frank over the course of two days and three nights (56 crucial hours to be precise) as he threatens to collapse from exhaustion. Haunted by visions of Rose (Cynthia Roman) a girl he failed to save Frank knows theres nothing like the joy of preventing a death. Indeed in the first scene he rescues an older man Mr. Burke (Cullen Oliver Johnson) who was presumed dead and brings him to the ER. As soon as he meets Burkes sensitive and distraught daughter Mary (Patricia Arquette) a former druggie whose character recalls Jodie Fosters teenage prostitute in ""Taxi Driver"" he falls for her determined to help her face the ordeal. The filmmakers dwell on how paramedics come face-to-face with the dead and the dying on a daily basis. Burned out by their demanding jobs they are broken both physically and spiritually. What keeps them going is a caustic sense of humor reflecting a worldview that is at once humane and acrid. Each night Frank teams with a different partner and his distinctive interactions with each paramedic provide the films texture -- and most entertaining elements for ultimately the narrative is about survival or how these pros cope with the miseries inherent to their chores. Unlike the emotionally involved Frank who does not separate himself from the suffering around him Larry (John Goodman) endures through cool detachment -- and his varied nightly meals. In contrast Tom (Tom Sizemore) is as savagely dangerous as some of his patients a borderline sociopath whose sense of justice is demented. Fatalism and Christianity seem to be the guiding principles for Marcus (Ving Rhames) who has found a way to deal with death convinced that every man has his own predetermined biological clock. With the exception of Arquette who gives a merely adequate performance rest of the cast is first-rate. In his best role since the Oscar-winning ""Leaving Las Vegas"" Cage is suitably cast as a tormented empathetic man in desperate need of salvation and sleep; pics closing image of him achieves a poetic quasi-religious tone. As much as ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Out of Sight"" this film has been blessed with a large and superlative ensemble of secondary characters with standout turns from Goodman Sizemore and Rhames as the three radically different partners. Also hitting high notes in small roles are Mary Beth Hurt who shines as a cynical nurse; Arthur Nascarella as the captain who refuses to fire Frank; Marc Anthony as a pathetically crazed homeless man; and Afemo Omilami as a cool hospital guard who never removes his sunglasses. Arguably the most surreal and psychedelic picture Scorsese has made ""Bringing Out the Dead"" benefits from its mostly nocturnal on-location shooting (primarily in Hells Kitchen). Ace lenser Robert Richardson has successfully devised elaborate lighting techniques and camera rigs for the dialogue scenes within the confined space of the ambulance. The masterfully staged climactic sequence involving drug lord Coates (Cliff Curtis) achieves the kind of dazzling effects (and literal fireworks) that recall the climax of Leos Caraxs ""Lovers on the Bridge."" Also making distinguished contributions are production designer Dante Ferretti -- particularly his garish pink-lit design of ""the Oasis"" Coates refuge for those suffering in the real world -- and longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker who accomplishes wonders in her seamless often hypnotic montages of street scenes. Although Scorsese and Schrader may not have pulled off alchemy by transforming an undistinguished piece of literature into a great film ""Bringing Out the Dead"" is still the best adaptation imaginable of its source material and a mature reworking of many of their longtime preoccupations.

Starring Nicolas Cage with Patricia Arquette John Goodman Ving Rhames Tom Sizemore and Marc Anthony. Written by Paul Schrader. Directed by Martin Scorsese. (R. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are some movies like some people that you start out hating and end up loving. In ""Bringing Out the Dead"" Martin Scorsese is back prowling the scuzzy after-dark streets of New York City where he is right at home. Director Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader return there for what amounts to the flip side of ""Taxi Driver."" It is equally shocking. It is also surprisingly funny and very moving. Nicolas Cage as a burned-out paramedic in spiritual crisis finally has the opportunity to roll out in one movie the full range of his talent from wild man to soulful. He is at risk of slipping into the same gutter from which he tries to rescue street crazies and other lost souls. ""Bringing Out the Dead"" is heavy duty but not heavy going once Scorsese gets his rhythm. Give it time to work. Potentially oppressive subject matter is redeemed by impeccable moral integrity and stunning artistry. Might as well get it out in the open right now ""Bringing Out the Dead"" is about mercy killing. Still with me? Anyone who can handle serious questions about life can devote two hours of theirs to this one. Salvation lies in how superbly it is done. Ambulance jockey Frank (Cage) works out of the emergency room at Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy hospital which he calls Our Lady of Perpetual Misery. Hes got the all-too- appropriately named graveyard shift and for five years hes seen an endless parade of the strung out the wigged out the down-and-out and the out-and-out crazy. Its gotten to him and now hes seeing ghosts of the dead he failed to save. The nighttime street setting -- gritty doesnt begin to describe it -- is the same as in ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) but Frank is the polar opposite of Robert De Niros paranoid Travis Bickle. Where Travis saw the scum of the earth Frank sees helplessly wandering souls. Hes got three paramedic partners in rotation. In ascending order of impact they are played by John Goodman (""Roseanne"") Ving Rha mes (""Con Air"") and Tom Sizemore (""Saving Private Ryan"") and they could well reflect different aspects of how Frank might end up. Goodman is bighearted and gruffly conscientious Rhames has a gleaming- eyed sense of the absurd and Sizemore has gone over the edge into sadistic frustration. When Frank brings a heart-attack victim back to life he meets Mary (Patricia Arquette Cages real-life wife) the mans estranged daughter. Arquette (""Stigmata"") too is vulnerable and at a crossroads; Mary could sink or swim. We become very familiar with the hectic emergency room where cynical seen-it-all doctors and nurses nonetheless heroically keep Marys father going with frequent defibrillation. Scorsese doesnt blink from scenes of excruciating pain but he also shows us moments of extraordinary grace. Sparks from a rescue welders torch merge into incongruous fireworks. The medics white uniforms turn luminescent. The last shot of the picture is suffused with deserved peace and it is beautiful. For Frank saving someones life is a way of saving his own but his string has run out. Cages sympathetic performance encompasses manic flashes gallows humor and a resigned gaze into the abyss. Hes capable of the grim put-on where he tells a failed suicide how to do it right. A dreamlike scene in a drug dealers blood-red apartment puts him on the razors edge as he stares at a tempting package of dope. Small roles ring large. The suicidal street crazy played by salsa singer Marc Anthony is more of a presence than a performance but Anthony dreadlocked and wrapped in steel cable is indelible. Cliff Curtis is both slick and ominous as a smooth- talking drug dealer. Arthur Nascarella is Franks supervisor reluctant to fire even the worst offenders and given to involuntary vocalizations. Out of the blue he barks like a dog. The blues-rock soundtrack seems exactly right what jazzed-up paramedics would blast on the radio screaming down the street at 4 a.m. Van Morrison (""T.B. Sheets"") R.E.M. (""Whats the Frequency Kenneth?"") Martha Reeves and the Vandellas (""Nowhere to Run"") the Cellos (""I Am a Japanese Sandman"") Big Brother and the Holding Company (""Combination of the Two""). Listen carefully to the two dispatchers. One of them called Love is the voice of Queen Latifah. The other is Scorsese himself. ..

Williams B- Bringing Out the Dead Genre Drama Comedy; Starring Patricia Arquette Nicolas Cage Marc Anthony John Goodman Queen Latifah Ving Rhames Tom Sizemore Michael K. Williams; Director Martin Scorsese; Release Date Wide 10/22/1999; MPAA Rating R Posted October 29 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT You are forgiven for feeling that importunate sense of deja vu. The tormented man rides the gaudy neon-smeared streets of New York City taking as his passengers the ravaged the desperate and the hopeless. Teetering on the edge of violence he fixes his attentions on a young woman who wears her cynicism like a broken wing. In a key scene he forces his way into the shadowy apartment of the man who is dragging her down to hell and... Well he doesnt pull a Travis Bickle and shoot the place up. In fact there is no cathartic act of violence to both condemn and redeem Bringing Out the Deads protagonist a burnt-out EMS driver named Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage). Is that because the life of a paramedic is already suffused with quotidian carnage? Or is it because director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader have moved beyond the need for street-corner apocalypse? After five years on the job Frank is seeing ghosts -- in particular the spectre of an asthmatic teenage girl he wasnt able to save. But the phantom that truly haunts Bringing Out the Dead is Taxi Driver the 1976 howl of urban despair that brought fame to its writer-director duo. A lot of things have changed in 23 years New York City not least among them. Scorsese is now a revered elder of American cinema acknowledged as the man who staked out the terrain on which Spike Lee Quentin Tarantino and dozens of others work. Schrader has kept at his fervid Calvinist obsessions as the maker of such art-house faves as Light Sleeper and last years Affliction. The two have grown up; they no longer seek to sucker-punch a viewer with tabloid artistry. Instead theyve made a case for maturity as an enemy of drama. Based on Joe Connellys 1998 autobiographical novel Bringing Out the Dead takes place over three nights during which Frank touches bottom and begins groping his way back toward daylight. Hes still an angel of mercy in his dreams but in reality he knows hes a harbinger of death and that dissonance has become intolerable. Careening through the skanky streets of Hells Kitchen Frank and his partners pull in drunks and suicidal crazies only to see them spewed back by a medical bureaucracy that has no place for them. They save a heart attack victim and watch him get stashed in a dusty corner of the emergency room for 48 hours. In an especially harrowing scene they help an immigrant squatter give birth to twins only one of whom survives; you can see the walls of Franks spirit collapse as he holds the stillborn infant while his colleague (Ving Rhames) exults over the life he has saved. --Bringing Out the Dead says that every night is like this -- a wire walk between grace and damnation.
