"Blended | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blended ) Blended (United States 2014) May 23 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Certain expectations accompany any Adam Sandler film although expectations have morphed over the years as Sandler has aged and attempted to broaden his target audience. Many of his best films such as Paul Thomas Andersons Punch Drunk Love have been met with a lukewarm reaction by Sandler die-hards. Of late he has descended into a morass of sub-mediocrity churning out movies that have varied from forgettable to unwatchable. Seeking to regain some box office traction Sandler has reunited with two-time co-star Drew Barrymore and returned to the rom-com field that proved successful with The Wedding Singer (which I didnt much care for) and 50 First Dates (which I did). Coming along for the ride is Sandlers long-time collaborator Frank Coraci who has directed three of the comedians previous outings (including The Wedding Singer) although the credited screenwriters Ivan Menchell and Claire Sera have never written for Sandler before. Its tough to say whether the lackluster Blended is the result of a bad script of whether Sandler and Coraci did unfortunate things to something better written. In the end it doesnt matter - despite the change in tone and genre Blended still falls into the ""forgettable to unwatchable"" category. Early in the proceedings Blended doesnt feel like any kind of Sandler movie weve seen before. The first scene which chronicles a disastrous blind date between Jim (Sandler) and Lauren (Barrymore) has an almost surreal sensibility and the scenes that immediately follow are equally low-key and devoid of energetic humor. Eventually the film amps up the quantity of its physical humor but the trite leaden romance weighs down the proceedings like an anchor. The sparks apparent in the most recent Sandler/Barrymore outing 50 First Dates are absent here. The actors are going through the motions. And while theres always a fair amount of predictability in romantic comedies Blended is so obvious about its intentions that the inevitable resolution doesnt offer the usual little thrill that comes with the validation of the fantasy. Blendeds presentation of the romance is so lazy that it borders on incompetent. The narrative relies on theA! contrivance of having widower Jim and his three daughters and divorcee Lauren and her two sons trapped in the same suite during a vacation in South Africa. In the wake of the bad blind date Jim and Lauren arent on friendly terms but Jim bonds with one of Laurens sons by teaching him how to play baseball and Lauren connects with one of Jims daughters by giving her a makeover. The story plods along like that until Jim and Lauren eventually realize they were meant to be together despite the interference of Laurens devious ex-husband. Whats missing from Blended? Two key ingredients it doesnt touch the heart and it doesnt tickle the funny bone (at least not often enough). Even bad romantic comedies usually enable the viewer to become invested in the central romance. In Blended we dont care. Its of little interest whether Jim and Lauren end up together. And the hit-and-miss humor doesnt do an adequate job of filling the breach left by the love storys failure. Im sure I laughed a few times during Blended but I cant remember what I was laughing at. Probably some Sandler pratfall. (Thankfully the movie is low on bodily fluids jokes which makes for a pleasant change of pace.) There are a few devices that add a little spice to the otherwise drab proceedings. On a couple of occasions when a character makes a grand entrance the soundtrack provides us with a montage of different pop songs to reflect the reactions of those who are watching. Then theres an offbeat ""Greek chorus"" led by Terry Crews. This becomes overused but at least in the beginning its an amusing conceit. Counterbalancing the good points however are the overabundance of product placements with Hooters and Dicks Sporting Goods getting undue attention. To be fair Sandler is fine in this role. Hes not annoying; in fact hes kind of likeable. Likewise Drew Barrymore is okay. The problem lies in the story and the manner in which Coraci attempts to spin his romantic web. It comes apart in tatters leaving the viewer to conclude that at least insofar as these two stars are concerned the third time is definitely not the charm.

The romance is sweet and even effervescent the comedy is homespun and sentimental but its packaged with such a repellent batch of stereotypes and prejudices that its unpalatable even to contemplate. As with other business catastrophes--and of course the jury is still out on whether this one will end up being a financial disaster or merely a moral one--the most interesting questions are meta How in the world could they have done this? And who are ""they"" and how did they manage for the duration of this production to check their common sense at the door? The making of ""Blended"" could be a ""what went wrong"" story for the ages. The framework of the movie is simple and strong if hackneyed two suburban single parents the divorced Lauren Reynolds (Barrymore) and the widowed Jim Friedman (Sandler) meet on a blind date that quickly veers to disaster. Vowing never to meet again they nonetheless cross paths in their neighborhood--a turn of events that foreshadows the core of the plot when an odd coincidence thrusts them and their families (his three girls her two boys) together at a resort. And of course its the children who convert the adults mutual distaste into love. This setup isnt obviously absurd--and the movie is a showcase for its stars. Im a fan of both of them and both are excellent here. Sandler a Jewish Everyman with the tone and the look of a live-action Fred Flintstone comes off as a man of the world--or at least of his world. He plays the manager of a sporting-goods store and when he wields a pen and jots down figures he seems to do it from experience. He speaks with garlicky wit and understated humor; his easygoing delivery harking back to the stoic manhood of studio-era stars suggest hearty feeling and hints at inner struggle. And Barrymores perky energy is equally harnessed to hidden panic and unexpressed pain. The movies blithe comedy hints that adulthood is hard. Its only when Jim and Lauren get to the resort that ""Blended"" enters the realm of the irredeemable. In the hope of brightening their childrens spring break Lauren and Jim--unbeknownst to each other--buy a mutual friends unused ticket to a South African safari resort which turns out to be a quasi-therapeutic family retreat. But even before the trip begins the children screech ""Were going to Africa"" suggesting precisely the skewed and generic view of life in that country--and on that continent--which is in short order presented. No sooner do the families arrive at the resort than the obliviously trivializing depictions of black people based on long-superseded stereotypes begin. The Friedmans get out of their limo and are greeted by the hotels staff all black starting with a singing group called Thathoo (pronounced ""Tattoo""). The group leaders eye-rolling and glad-handing his lubriciously insinuating and exaggeratedly jiving all seem to be taken straight from a minstrel show. And throughout the movie the group pops up like a Greek chorus to underline the action. Theres also an obsequious greeter whose exaggerated ingratiations would shame the hospitality business. Though his malapropisms are ultimately seen to be a canny joke his manner is never anything but grinningly servile. And theres an elderly slacker sleeping on the job and avoiding responsibility whose lazy ways are a monstrous and venerable cliche. For that matter the movie is also reactionary in its gender stereotypes with Jim standing in as athletic counselor to Laurens younger son and Lauren taking over the styling of Jims unhappily tomboyish older daughter whom he calls Larry (her name is actually Hilary and its one of the gags of the movie that the middle girls name is Espen--shes named after ESPN). Im astonished by the failure of the skilled and successful moviemakers involved in ""Blended."" This encompasses the director Frank Coraci who directed one of Sandlers better movies ""Click""; the screenwriters Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera both of whom have been in the business for around twenty years; and a team of veteran producers including Sandler himself. I wonder whether anyone on hand during preproduction or the shoot had an inkling of the offensiveness of the script or the depictions--and if so why they either said nothing or went unheeded. Did they prefer to ride the speeding train with the rest of the cast and crew past the edge of the cliff? ""Blended"" starts with the ordinary and touching problems of ordinary people--divorce bereavement misunderstanding frustration responsibilities--and if it had sought to resolve them at a hotel in the Catskills or for that matter had even looked at the people working at the resort in South Africa with as tender a camera eye as the one that films Sandler Barrymore and the actors playing their children it might have had a chance to emerge as a passably sweet honorably sentimental if somewhat old-fashioned entertainment. Its an ongoing issue in the realm of movies though the money that actors directors producers writers and others make in Hollywood; the layers of insulating staffers that their success buys; the fame and influence that they win; and the peculiarly outsized and distorted self-image resulting from celebrity distance them from the lives and concerns--as well as the practicalities and the psychology--of ordinary life. Which is to say how can people living extraordinary lives depict ordinary ones? How can those inside the bubble credibly embody those outside it? (A strong director with a coherent view of life helps Sandler was superb in Judd Apatows ""Funny People"" as a famous comedian who grew too big for his britches and gets deflated to natural size--at least temporarily.) In an earlier age when the theatre was centered on heroes of myth and history it was the actors who were small who had to raise themselves up on tiptoes and expand themselves to fit their roles. The riot that actors ran the uninhibited emotional voracity that rendered them odious to staid burghers (plus ca change) helped them feel the authority and cavalier freedom of the mighty. In movies for the most part actors have to scale themselves down even as they render their everyday heroes hyperbolic lending ordinary people grand and tragic emotions. I suspect that the makers of ""Blended"" didnt intend to give offense that their depiction of black South Africans was meant to be sincerely affectionate that their gender stereotypes were based on what they considered to be experience and observation--that the movie reflects not evil designs but a narrowed scope and a filtered point of view. In earlier Hollywood movies the prejudices built into society at large were reflected onscreen. The exclusions were so numerous and strong that the studio eras highly distilled sense of the ordinary represented only a small sliver of American society and held it up as an abstract ideal for everyone else. Those older hierarchies were conscious; those of ""Blended"" seem oblivious. Maybe that very obliviousness makes them an image an X-ray of the unconscious and unintended but very real exclusions and prejudices at work in even some of the most liberal sectors of American life today. The movies misguided blunders are revealing. They could even serve as a sharp critique--also doubtless unintended--of the filtering bubble of suburban middle-class life. Photograph Warner Bros.

Pictures - (c) 2014 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. A romance ripped from the pages of Deuteronomy Frank Coracis Blended posits that the best reason for a woman with sons and a man with daughters to get married is that they can take care of each others kids. Quel pragmatisme In the world of this sitcom love story men are from Mars and women should be from a defiled menstrual tent far enough away that Adam Sandler wont have to hear them talk about tampons. (To be fair in Blended even an elderly pharmacy clerk is eager to tell Sandler about the size of her vagina.) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Sandler and Drew Barrymore play single parents with zero dating experience whose first blind date is naturally a disaster. Their characters married before college graduation managed to spawn five kids between them and yet despite spending almost two decades with their former spouses (one dead one a dick) have never learned anything about the opposite sex. Hell they could have learned everything they needed to know about each other by watching another romantic comedy as bad as this Hes the schlub who mans a sports store with Shaq; shes the pearl-clenching workaholic who co-owns a closet-organizing company.Will she school him on responsibility? Will he teach her to loosen up? Duh. Will Blended take two hours and a trip to Africa to get there while implanting uncomfortable messages like ""girls arent pretty without long hair""? Alas yes.The only thing exceptional about this third-time pairing of Sandler and Barrymore is how tone-deaf it is about romance. In fact it hardly seems to believe in romance at all -- the couples big gooey speech is all about how their kids come first. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Its also tone-deaf about Sandlers increasingly strained appeal. The fun of his early career was watching his goons earn our love. Here hes more oafish than ever a porn obsessive who acts like Rain Man and accuses Barrymore of being a lesbian for hugging a female friend (the too-good-for-this-but-at-least-shes-working Wendi McLendon-Covey). He doesnt earn our love he demands it.As for the ever-empathetic Barrymore shes too sweet to play shrill. Instead of the blossoming tenderness of The Wedding Singer (which Coraci also directed) we now have a couple united by their fear of sexuality When Barrymore sees a stripper pole she shrieks and the first time Sandler sees his 15-year-old daughter (Bella Thorne) in a dress his mind blasts ""Its the End of the World As We Know It.""Luckily or unluckily for them the back flips of the script kick them and their broods to an unnamed country in Africa (what every nation was too scared to take credit?) where the locals are all incompetent and salivating over Western mating habits. Barrymore and Sandler cant even consider a kiss without resort singer Terry Crews creeping behind them and crooning about it. If only Crews could drop the mic grab Shaq and go make their own movie.

DAVID BLOOMER BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF BlendedStarring Adam Sandler Drew Barrymore Directed by Frank Coraci Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual content and language Running time 1 hour 57 minutes Playing In wide release (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitThe flip side of Adam Sandlers broad humor is his sentimentality that swamps this comedy about two single parents and their broods who are shoved together in an African resort. Grade C Comedians often draw on childhood influences and Adam Sandler and his team do it in the worst possible way in ""Blended."" This movie about a widower (Sandler) with three daughters and a divorcee (Drew Barrymore) with two sons is like a Bizarro version of ""The Brady Bunch."" Take away the humor about bodily functions and the adolescent sex jokes (by which I also mean the ""adult"" sex jokes) and whats left? A TV-ready sitcom about two reluctant heart-warmers a beautiful spunky gal who wins over a new family when she serenades them with ""Over the Rainbow"" (not realizing that the wife who succumbed to cancer adored ""The Wizard of Oz"") and an earnest unpretentious guy who conquers the heroines family when he teaches her Little League-challenged younger son how to hit a baseball. The movie resembles two time-tested sorts of TV episodes stitched together and stretched to a near-two-hour running time. Half is like a pilot about an unlikely couple deciding that they really love each other (theyre an unlikely couple only to people who write press releases) and half is like a special holiday episode in which they venture forth from middle-class homes for an exotic getaway broods in tow. In this case the vacation site is a South African resort. ""Blended"" breaks from these sitcom traditions by making sure Barrymore and Sandler end up in the same Sun City suite when they still think they hate each other because all theyve shared is one disastrous blind date. (Director Frank Coraci and screenwriters Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera invent a whole other set of characters mostly to make the synchronicity happen.) It takes the romantic glories of a lush wild continent and all the amenities of a luxury resort to bring them to their senses. The resort features an in-house South African harmony group Thathoo played by the real-life group Junior Mambazo. Terry Crews plays its exhibitionistic lead singer who appears to think it wildly amusing to lead the group in musical restatements of the obvious. Audiences may bewail the waste of Junior Mambazos glorious polyphony. After two previous hits (""The Wedding Singer"" which Coraci also directed and ""50 First Dates"") Barrymore and Sandler are relaxed with each other - or maybe Barrymore is simply strong enough as a co-comedian to calm Sandler down. Still apart from some site-specific stunts (she goes parasailing he and her younger son ride ostriches) the movies novelty comes from their embodiments of parental devotion not from charting new comic ground. Sandlers character manages a sporting-goods store in keeping with his kosher-salt-of-the-earth personality; Barrymores is a closet organizer. Sandler hasnt lost his inexplicable connection to the audience; Barymore retains her characteristic warmth and charm. If she doesnt choose her parts more carefully though she just might become the Florence Henderson of her generation.

Adam Sandlers latest comedyA Blended makes a case for wholesome family values but its a good family movie the way Hooters is a good family restaurant -- good for reactionary white pervs who like synthetic (reheated) fast food served by fawning stereotypes. Hooters by the way is the setting for the ridiculous blind date between widower Jim (Sandler) and divorcee Lauren (Drew Barrymore) that opens the film. The scene is a commercial for the chain and the first of many tie-ins the most prominent with Dicks Sporting Goods Not only does Jim manage a Dicks but Dick himself figures in the plot. From now on I think I better go to Mos. Lauren is a professional organizer with two sons who need a dad. Jim is a sports fanatic with three daughters who need a mom. I trust you see the mathematical possibilities Its Geometry 1 the mental defectives section. At first Lauren loathes Jim and vice versa. But as the Fates conspire to bring them together they begin to sense how vital they could be to each others families. Only the man can teach the womans hyperactive insecure younger boy to be scary-aggressive on the baseball field. Only the woman can turn the mans supposedly fugly tomboy daughter (Bella Thorne) into a teen goddess in short little dresses who can actually attract a guy. Related Stories Quiz Did Drew Barrymore Date This Person in Real Life or in a Movie (or Both)? And these lessons are learned on a trip to a South African resort where black people in resplendent purple smile sing pop their eyes flex their biceps and basically exist to teach white people how to fall in love. Ooh they are so fuuuunnny these happy Negroes always popping up to encourage Jim and Laura to blend their families because that dontcha know is what life is all about. Id like to be fair here. Some of you could reasonably argue that these gender and racial behaviors have a firm basis in reality. You could at least if this were 1955. Youd be wrong and I wouldnt want to know you but you wouldnt be out of step with the times. These days the setup of Blended doesnt feel old-fashioned. It feels antediluvian. It feels morally sclerotic --and icky. I come to Blended as someone who is believe it or not sympathetic to Sandler and only recently (after such Razzie-worthy work as Jack and Jill and Grown Ups 2) decided he had the most punchable face in movies. He radiates self-absorption but of the juvenile fogbound kind that carries a touch of sadness Hes like the little boy who hits you because he cant figure out another way to express himself. Paul Thomas Anderson captured that aspect of him in Punch-Drunk Love. And in The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates Barrymores radiant sweetness managed to cut through that fog and make him seem halfway human. The third times not the charm though. Barrymore starts out winningly (her best scenes are with Wendi McLendon-Covey who has a good pushy delivery as Laurens confidante) but soon resorts to phony peals of laughter at Sandlers winning quips and moist cow eyes at his sheer paternal decency. I was embarrassed for her. Sandler fans will find the usual gross-out and smutty gags amid all this cloying wholesomeness rhinos fornicating blondes shaking their boobies adolescents caught whacking off to porn. Blended isnt 3-D but it feels like it Sandler would piss out of the screen if he thought he could get a laugh. This is not his worst film but its his most offensive. It made me long for the relative innocence of Jack and Jill the penetrating father-son insights of Thats My Boy the psychological subtleties of Happy Gilmore...

PHILIP BROWN Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 23 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 23 2014 824AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Frank Coraci Written by Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera Starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore Classification PG Year 2014 Country USA Language English Another year has passed and so as with the cold inevitability of death another Adam Sandler movie is upon us. At the start of his career there was a gleeful surrealism and inventive stupidity to Sandlers comedies. In the middle of his career there was a brief moment suggesting hidden depths to the comedian in more challenging films such as Punch-Drunk Love. These days Sandler is frustratingly repetitive safe and dull three of the finest comedy-killing qualities. Granted his movies still make millions and given the ever-increasing explosion of shameless product placement in his work (this time Hooters and Dicks Sporting Goods get plenty of plot-based ad space) thats just fine by him. So it comes as a mild relief that Sandlers latest effort Blended can be described as surprisingly tolerable. The movie offers nothing new or special but at least it isnt as painful as watching Sandler walk Al Pacino through a Dunkin Donuts rap. Blended reunites Sandler with Drew Barrymore and their natural onscreen chemistry is the films biggest selling point. Shes Lauren a professional closet organizer (dont ask the filmmakers dont explain) and hes Jim a sporting goods store manager who works with Shaq (again dont ask). Shes got two sons hes got three daughters. Theyre both single parents who seem surprisingly financially stable given their niche jobs and responsibilities. So a Brady Bunch union seems inevitable until a horrible first date at Hooters spoils the dream. Thankfully a ludicrous plot contrivance not worth explaining finds both families sharing a vacation in Africa. It takes 40 minutes of screen time to get there but after what seems like the worlds longest set-up for a rhino sex sight gag the movie settles into a gentle family rom-com filled with equal parts sightseeing and lesson-learning. The kids each get one note to play before being abandoned and a few of Sandlers pals like Kevin Nealon pop up for bizarre cameos. Barrymore bites her lip Sandler smiles and mutters to himself and we are on the road to true love.As sarcastic as that sounds there is undeniable charm to watching Sandler and Barrymore together (her shrill brand of panic comedy and his mumbling middle-aged slacker routine play poorly however when they have to handle a scene solo). The movie even comes dangerously close to being touching in moments when Jim and Lauren struggle to justify even looking for love outside of their parental responsibilities. Unfortunately those fleeting glimpses of emotional maturity quickly disappear in favour of additional slapstick and cliched plot devices. Along the way there are even a few genuine laughs thanks to the dependable talents of Nealon Wendi McLendon-Covey and Terry Crews (whose intense commitment to his absolutely absurd all-singing role somehow works through sheer force of will). Those laughs might be immature and the romance predictable but at least they exist.What it all amounts to is a deeply mediocre comedy. Thats certainly nothing special yet given how particularly tepid the last eight Happy Madison productions have been it qualifies as a modest improvement. At this point asking Sandler to grow up would be as fruitless as asking the same of Peter Pan. However asking for competency is reasonable given his power in Hollywood and if nothing else Blended proves that just might be possible.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 23 2014 at 1212 AM updated May 23 2014 at 1213 AM comments I can think of worse ways to spend nearly two hours in a chair than watching ""Blended"" but most of them involve Novocain a buzzing drill and someones fat fingers in my mouth. Actually maybe that isnt that much worse. Adam Sandlers latest attempt to lower the comedy bar and give all his old college pals a job ""Blended"" is the story of a bad first date that Sandlers Jim has with Drew Barrymores Lauren. That he takes her to Hooters in New Jersey gives you an idea of how dreadful the date is but hey give him some credit. At least he didnt take her to ""Thats My Boy."" Anyway they part as frenemies. Until the kind of plot twists that would give a contortionist a charley horse has them sharing a luxury hotel suite. In Africa. With their five kids. Let the hilarity and ""Lion King"" references begin Of course all the usual ethnic and racial cliches are invoked. But theyre just the icing on the sort of dusty gender stereotypes most corny Sandler movies traffic in with the guys being just big slobby smelly kids and the gals being nagging little control freaks. Gals who of course in the end kind of have a point and get the guy to clean up his act and commit. Which is supposed to be a happy ending because hes such a you know catch. Right. To some small credit Sandler cedes a good deal of the comedy time to occasional co-star Barrymore as the divorced mom. (Sandler playing the widower card tries to be a little more sensitive here -- even his awful choice in restaurants has a sentimental excuse). But he plays it so low-key theres nothing much for him to do apart from the clueless-dad shtick and some awkward comedy with an ostrich. The big laughs never come. Nor can the supporting cast fill in the gaps. Kevin Nealon milks one or two mild gags as a hotel guest and Terry Crews is game enough as a strolling African singer but the shrill Jessica Lowe seems to be doing a bad Anna Faris impression. And as for the child stars -- one of whom is nicknamed Frodo but looks more like the apocalyptic second coming of Corey Feldman -- well the less said the more theyll appreciate it when they go on to other careers. The filmmakers went to Africa to shoot the African footage so at least that looks pretty even with some obvious greenscreen. (They went to Georgia to shoot their Jersey footage and that looks like well Georgia.) And I think I smiled twice. But spread out over two hours? Even the dentist gets more laughs than that. And once I see him at least I know Im safe for another six months. Ratings note The film contains sexual material strong language and drug references. Blended (PG-13) Warner Bros. (117 min.) Directed by Frank Coraci. With Adam Sandler Drew Barrymore.

"Adam Sandler flops with family comedy Blended review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAdam Sandler flops with family comedy Blended reviewAdam Sandler teams with Drew Barrymore for third time in terrible South African-set family comedy Blended.Lauren (Drew Barrymore) and Jim (Adam Sandler) in their new movie Blended.  (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture / !(c)2014 Warner Bros. Entertainmen)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. May 22 2014BlendedStarring Adam Sandler Drew Barrymore Kevin Nealon Terry Crews and Wendi McLendon-Covey. Directed by Frank Coraci. 117 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGThe jokes in Adam Sandler movies are like buses. If you miss one its coming back in five minutesAnd so it is with romantic comedy Blended whose title is a nod to melding families but which could also refer to Sandlers fondness for mixing his vacations with craptastic moviemaking.Article Continued BelowIn this case its South Africa or as its called throughout the film Africa.The gags about masturbation girls who look like boys lesbians and a cutie who talks like the Exorcists demon recycle endlessly.Drew Barrymore plays single mom Lauren reteaming with Sandler for the third time after The Wedding Singer (1998) and 50 First Dates (2004). She risks a hernia carrying this bloated turkey on her back. Incredibly shes game for much of it funny and charming throughout.She gets a lively assist from NFL linebacker-turned-actor Terry Crews as a preening Sun City resort singer whose muscular showboating antics provide relief from the strangely bloated-looking Sandlers somnambulate performance. And Bridesmaids Wendi McLendon-Covey is in fine form as Laurens kid-hating business partner.It takes a while for the story to get to Africa opening with sporting goods store employee Jim (Sandler) taking professional closet organizer Lauren on a blind date to Hooters where he ignores her and makes fun of her job. They hate each other from the outset.Sandler who has an almost pathological need to be the misunderstood hero of every self-absorbed movie he makes gets a pass for repeatedly being a jerk because he has a dead wife and is devoted to his three tomboy daughters Hillary (Bella Thorne) who he calls Larry Espn (named for the network) who holds conversations with her dead mom and wee cutie Lou (Alyvia Alyn Lind). He even has a darned good reason for taking Lauren to Hooters so take that you judging woman.Lauren has two boys; the elder is the target of a barrage of self-abuse jokes (Braxton Beckham) and the other is a hyperactive poor sport (Kyle Red Silverstein) who might learn how to connect bat with baseball if only there was a strong male influence in his life (hint hint).A complicated bit of ridiculousness allows each parent to buy a share in a cancelled fantasy trip to South Africa unbeknownst to the other. The crassly decorated resort wrapped in zebra stripes and Vegas glitter is a nightmarish place that looks like a cross between Chers bedroom and the set of Bwana Devil.Among the guests enjoying the blended family-themed week are May-December canoodlers played by Kevin Nealon and Jessica Lowe (and co-starring her cleavage which she uses as a punctuation mark ending each sentence with a shimmy).Occasionally Sandler rouses himself to engage with Barrymore and these are the rare times that Blended works thanks to their easy chemistry onscreen. Then he rides an ostrich.Directed by Frank Coraci and written by Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera Blended is a rather sloppily-made effort with stock shots of lions and giraffes randomly dropped in. A scene where Lauren admires the animal kingdom from a jeep-tethered parachute ride is laughable and not for the right reasons. Horrible onscreen switches from stunt performers to stars are cringeworthy.Blended is a movie with training wheels where everything is spelled out and the path to Lauren and Jim moving from ""I hate you"" to ""I do"" is lit up like a landing strip in the desert.And of course what would an Africa movie be without a pair of mating rhinos?

Its a crude silly romantic comedy whose best idea is reuniting him with Drew Barrymore. May 22 2014 -- 318pm Warner Bros. Drew Barrymore is tired of Adam Sandlers shtick in ""Blended."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Will Adam Sandler ever grow up? His comic persona remains a boyish boob even as he enters middle age. Jim Carrey Bill Murray Will Ferrell and Steve Carell show their versatility in roles that stretch and test their talents. Sandler sits apart an overgrown goof stubbornly unwilling to evolve. His latest ""Blended"" shows him still stuck in neutral. Its a crude silly romantic comedy whose best idea is reuniting him with Drew Barrymore his co-star in ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""50 First Dates."" This film is essentially a footnote to those originals. Miss it and you miss very little. After their hate-at-first-sight date the widowed Sandler and the divorced Barrymore find themselves sharing quarters at a luxury resort with his three daughters and her two sons. Hes a schlubby sporting-goods salesman; shes a compulsively structured closet organizer. Sandler whose testiness is never far from the surface whatever role hes playing inquires about her career path. ""Did you start with organizing glove compartments and move up?"" he asks with curdled nastiness. Its the sort of thing only a militant jerk would say. Its also the wittiest line in this two-hour death march. ""Blended"" follows the pattern of recent Sandler movies in which he picks a vacation spot hed like to visit pulls together a crew of his cronies and makes a movie of it. The setting here is a palatial hotel in South Africa which sets up borderline racist gags about the black staff who are uniformly asleep at the switch. Even the estimable Terry Crews is an embarrassment as an eye-popping hambone minstrel-style lounge singer. Fans of the bestiality theme in Sandlers films will be pleased to learn that there is man-on-giraffe tongue kissing and a gratuitous shot of rhinoceros copulation. BLENDED 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content and language. Sandler doesnt break a sweat in his performance. His character is given one simple task -- bond with his daughters despite his entirely sports-centric worldview (he insists his blossoming eldest should bulk up for basketball season and named his middle girl Espn after his favorite TV channel). The story trajectory that brings him and Barrymore into romantic alignment would have been a cliche in the Late Pleistocene epoch. Barrymore is a winning loosey-goosey comedian who can pick up the slack when Sandler cant be bothered. She rises to every occasion whether its a passage of broad physical humor or a moment of starry-eyed sentimentality. Early in the film she and Sandler have a disastrous dinner date. For reasons that dont matter she spit-coughs a quart of French onion soup all over the table. You dont laugh at the action itself unless you are very new to movies. You may well smile at her commitment to the idiocy required of her What a good sport. She brings a game go-along sense of fun the film desperately needs. What a shame she doesnt have a better movie to frame her talent.

Picture In theaters Friday May 23 2 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars) The carcasses left behind from Adam Sandlers movies arent pretty. You Dont Mess With The Zohan. Thats My Boy. Grown Ups. Grown Ups 2. The one with Keri Russell. The one where he played fraternal twins. PHOTOS Costars reunited But even those befuddled by the appeal of SNLs guitar-playing man-boy (now 47) must admit that hes never been more charming than when he flirts with Drew Barrymore in front of a camera. Whether hes serenading her on an airplane in 1998s The Wedding Singer or wooing her in a marina in 2004s 50 First Dates the guy knows how to raise his game--and put on a nice dress shirt--in the company of a beauty. Youve likely seen the trailer for their third rom-com collaboration. Consider this review as confirmation of your fears and hopes The flick is really really really really dumb yet gets by thanks to the sweet chemistry of its stars. PHOTOS Drews wild style Barrymore is Lauren a divorcee with two prepubescent boys on her hands. She goes on a blind date with Sandlers Jim himself a widower with three adorable girls. Its a disaster with a capital D. Hes put off by her uptight attitude and matronly outfit; shes repulsed that he took her to a Hooters and bogarted her beer. (Sadly Big Daddys Corinne is not their waitress.). Theyre just not that into each other. At all. In a ridiculous only-in-the-movies contrivance they end up on vacation with their respective families at the same South African resort. And. . . wait for it. . . the staff is under the impression that theyre a couple Soon the group reluctantly goes on safaris and sits together during dinners under the stars. The sight of Sandler falling off a giant ostrich amuses for about two seconds. More demoralizing is the thought that the cast got a paid trip to an exotic location for months while youre sitting in a dark theater watching Barrymore nearly slit her pants on the horn of a rhinoceros. Isnt she too old for silly slapstick? PHOTOS Drews love life Ah but a few extra years can be a good thing. In 2014 these stars are aware they cant just be cute and fall in love and call it a movie. To the movies credit Jim and Laurens relationship with each others kids holds the same weight as their relationship to each other. Its touching to see Jim show her son how to hit a baseball and talk to girls while Lauren gives his tomboy 15-year-old daughter (Bella Thorne) a makeover and sings a lullaby to his youngest. The family bonding allows the budding romance to feel organic and playful. The film also gets it right when Jim and Lauren share their last supper still as friends who havent even kissed. Both of them have dressed up for the occasion and exude a nervous energy in a way that most singles do in the first-date phase. Its a little heart-melting. PHOTOS Drews hair evolution But lets not get carried away. No Sandler film would be complete without a spate of eye-rolling boob and pee jokes. And do-me-a-favor roles for pals Kevin Nealon and Steve Buscemi. A few familiar characters pop by too. (Do you really want to find out here? Thought not.) Heres hoping Sandler and Barrymore have more reunions in store. Because no matter how lame their material is its a delight growing old with them.

"Review Blended with Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler is fun - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Blended with Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler is fun Gary Goldstein Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have fun in Blended It could have been a bit smarter and a lot shorter but ""Blended"" the third big-screen pairing for Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore (after ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""50 First Dates"") is a fun often funny largely enjoyable romp. The trick Manage your expectations.Following a disastrous first date at of all places Hooters single parents Jim Friedman (Sandler) and Lauren Reynolds (Barrymore) accidentally find themselves and their kids stuck sharing an exotic vacation -- one expressly designed for all kinds of blended families -- at a safari resort in South Africa. How they get there is a long not credible story one best not over analyzed. Jim a widower has three daughters 15-year-old tomboy Hilary a.k.a. Larry (Bella Thorne); the sensitive Espn (Emma Fuhrmann) yes after the TV network; and sweet little Lou (Alyvia Alyn Lind). Divorcee Lauren has two boys adolescent horndog Brendan (Braxton Beckham) and the younger wildly hyperactive Tyler (Kyle Red Silverstein). Both parents are more than a tad clueless when it comes to raising their opposite-sex kids which is to say Jim and Lauren need each other.It takes a while of course for the Friedmans and the Reynolds to warm up to one another as they navigate sleeping arrangements dining protocol and some forced sightseeing. But soon the kids are happily ogling lions riding ostriches improving at sports and getting glam makeovers. Meanwhile buttoned-up Lauren goes parasailing and the scruffier Jim actually combs his hair to impress you-know-who. Sure the new symbiosis and Kumbaya vibe between and within these families is predictable. So is Jim and Laurens tentative attraction. But there are enough amusing bits lively visuals cute music cues and nice emotional beats to carry the day. Photos Only a handful of movies qualify for the exclusive club of films that have taken in more than 1 billion in worldwide box office -- and only three have made more than 2 billion. By Charles Fleming | Sources Los Angeles Times Box Office Mojo Much mileage is also gained from the resorts omnipresent nine-man harmony group called Thathoo (featuring members from the South African a cappella group Junior Mambazo). Terry Crews playing the singers shamelessly buff and ebullient frontman is a hoot.Though the film directed by Frank Coraci (""The Wedding Singer"") and written by Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera contains a somewhat protracted will-they-or-wont-they third act (two guesses -- no make that one -- how Jim and Lauren end up) the story ultimately earns its feel-good stripes.Barrymore is lovely and engaging here while Sandler is well served by taking a more restrained and humane approach than usual; maturity becomes both actors. Wendi McLendon-Covey Joel McHale Kevin Nealon Jessica Lowe and even Shaquille ONeal offer enjoyable support.------------""Blended""MPAA rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content language.Running time 1 hour 57 minutes.Playing In general release.

The two are unexpectedly reunited when coincidentally they end up on the same African safari vacation with their children in ""Blended."" (David Bloomer) By Stephanie Merry May 22 2014 Follow stephmerry Adam Sandlers Happy Madison Productions churns out some of the most idiotic comedies to land on the big screen. To wit Last years ""Grown Ups 2"" was one of the worst movies since 2012s ""Thats My Boy"" which was at least slightly better than Razzie winner ""Jack and Jill"" from 2011. Compared to its forebears the romantic comedy ""Blended"" looks like ""Annie Hall."" Of course the bar is low. But when the fire alarm started ringing an hour into a recent screening of the movie and the whole audience had to file out to the street just about everyone appeared to return for the final hour. So thats something. Sixteen years since Sandler starred opposite Drew Barrymore in ""The Wedding Singer"" and a decade since they did it again in ""50 First Dates"" the pair have grown up even if the comedy hasnt. They play Jim and Lauren two single parents who go on a disastrous blind date. Not only does Jim take Lauren to Hooters and drain her beer while shes in the bathroom but he also pays only for his half of the tab. Worse he beats Lauren to the punch getting an ""emergency"" call halfway through the date which was exactly the exit strategy she was planning. Basically Jim is a schlubby Mr. Darcy antagonizing Lauren only to potentially win her over later when the two each with their children coincidentally end up on the same African safari vacation intended for Brady Bunch-esque blended families. There are a lot of misses when it comes to the comedy whether its seeing rhinos mid-coitus or the recurring gag of Lauren carrying one of her sleeping sons to bed and slamming his head into door jambs. One extended scene involving crocodiles seems to exist solely so Sandler can say he got so scared he made a ""zebra stripe"" in his underwear. One of the most dependable jokes comes courtesy of Terry Crews The ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" star plays a spirited and muscled resort troubadour who shows up singing at the oddest moments always with a huge group of backup singers. 1 of 40 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Summer movie guide 2014 Godzilla X-Men Transfomers and more View Photos Movies are about to get loud and silly.

The Fault in Our Stars (June 6) Dont forget the tissues. The movie based on a bestselling young adult novel by John Green follows a teenager stricken with cancer (Shailene Woodley) who falls for a free-spirited boy (Ansel Elgort) set on teaching her how to live while she still can. James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. ""Blended"" is more successful when it lets itself be sentimental. Jims middle daughter Espn (Emma Fuhrmann) -- pronounced ""Espin"" her namesake is the television network -- talks constantly to her dead mother even saving seats for Jims late wife at the breakfast table. And his youngest daughter Lou (the adorable Alyvia Alyn Lind) is in such desperate need of a mom figure she latches onto Lauren the moment they meet. But the filmmakers including director Frank Coraci (who also did ""The Wedding Singer"") seem terrified to dwell in sensitive territory for too long. Each sweet moment is inevitably punctuated by some in-your-face joke thats at least as stupid as the preceding moments were heartfelt. ""Blended"" has other problems too including some faulty editing and a typically predictable finale. But there are some genuinely sweet and funny moments which are more than enough to exceed expectations.   PG-13. At area theaters.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 736 p.m. EDT May 22 2014Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler star together again.(Photo Frank Masi Warner Bros. Pictures)You have to work hard to make an African vacation seem unpleasant.And Adam Sandler nearly pulls it off in Blended ( out of four; rated PG-13; opening Friday nationwide.)But Drew Barrymore brings out something approaching low-key and likable in Sandler.Hes a tad more appealing here as the widowed father of three daughters than he has been in his recent roster of arrested development comic misfires.The pair have obvious chemistry. That doesnt mitigate the stupidity and predictability of the plot but at least its not painful to sit through. Although the comedy is hardly uproarious and is often downright clunky its an improvement over Sandlers last few tone-deaf efforts like Grown-Ups and Grown Ups 2Thats My Boy and Jack and Jill. This is not exactly the Sandler of Punch Drunk Love but its a marked improvement over You Dont Mess with the Zohan.Most of the story takes place in South Africa where Jim (Sandler) takes his three daughters and Lauren (Barrymore) transports her two sons during the kids school holiday. The two adults met briefly on a dreadful blind date. She ended up with his soup spilled down the front of her blouse and he concocted the excuse of an avalanche to curtail the painful evening. They walked away mutually disgusted.Then through a series of contrived circumstances involving Laurens best pal Jen (Wendi McLendon-Covey)  Jim and Lauren and their children end up on the same luxury getaway sharing a grandly garish suite.Their resort surroundings look more like Las Vegas crossed with Disney World than an authentic South African locale. But gorgeous countryside and shots of wildlife raise the film a notch.Communing with elephants and ostriches is far preferable to the contrivances of the plot. Jim has daughters and Lauren has sons. Jim shows Barrymores younger son how to hit a baseball and Lauren takes Jims tomboyish daughter for a makeover.A more charming presence is that of Nickens (Terry Crews) a cheerful singer with a group of back-up vocalists who serenade Jim and Lauren as a kind of comic Greek chorus.Sandler is at his most relaxed in the role of attentive dad. A manager at a sporting goods store Jim connects with the girls through sports. But he isnt ready for his oldest 15-year-old Hilary (Bella Thorne) to grow up. He calls her ""Larry"" and a series of humorless jokes center around her being taken for a boy.Sandler has a comfortable affability with Barrymore with whom he starred in The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates. His performance is a reminder that he is capable of a winning acting style. Its a relief to be spared his juvenile antics.Barrymore is even more natural her easy manner making the viewer wish she took more substantial roles in a wider range of movies. Her ex-husband is played by Joel McHale in a humorless role that makes one long for his caustic persona in TVs Community.Dialogue can be thuddingly unfunny such as when a hotel worker sees rhinos mating and proclaims ""You wont see that in New Jersey""But there are also a few moments of surprising sweetness mostly having to do with single parenthood.It turns out that devoted parents Lauren and Jim have a lot more in common than they thought. Of course the audience knew from the first frame that theyd end up together.Its been 16 years since 1998s The Wedding Singer (also directed by Blendeds Frank Coraci) but Sandler and Barrymore have not ventured much further artistically.Nothing fresh or surprising will shake or stir audiences in Blended.Drew Barrymore left Bella Thorne Alyvia Alyn Lind Emma Fuhrmann Braxton Beckham Kyle Red Silverstein and Adam Sandler mix it up in ""Blended.""

Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT After a disastrous blind date two single parents are forced together for a family vacation. Rated PG-13 (language suggestive humor) BOTTOM LINE The familiar Sandler-Barrymore chemistry lends a bit of sparkle to this otherwise predictable family rom-com. CAST Adam Sandler Drew Barrymore Bella Thorne LENGTH 157 ""Blended"" is a comedy about modern romance that comes with a mile-wide traditional streak. The story of two single parents thrown together on an African vacation for non-nuclear families ""Blended"" has an open heart (look for a split-second appearance by a gay-led household) even if its mind seems closed to truly new ideas. Adam Sandler plays Jim a widower raising three girls on his own while Barrymore is Lauren whose cheating husband (Joel McHale of NBCs ""Community"") has left her with two boys. Mutually repulsed after a disastrous blind date Jim and Lauren are inadvertently reunited in Africa with their respective broods in tow. Forced to share meals and even a suite the two families form a reluctant Brady Bunch while the African staffers (Terry Crews Abdoulaye NGom) pull faces and crack wise. Wendi McLendon-Covey Kevin Nealon and newcomer Jessica Lowe round out a fitfully funny support cast.

Jim the clueless male calls his three girls Larry short for Hillary (Bella Thorne); Espn as in the sports channel (shes played by a rather moving Emma Fuhrmann); and Lou (Alyvia Alyn Lind). Lauren meanwhile is the fluttery female ill-equipped to handle a rambunctious 9-year-old Tyler (Kyle Red Silverstein) and a porn-consuming pubescent Brendan (Braxton Beckham). Theres an entrenched conservatism in the way that Jim plays sports with the boys while Lauren gives the girls makeovers. But if theres also something comforting and endearing about all of this much credit goes to Sandler and Barrymore. After three movies together (including 2004s ""50 First Dates"") Barrymores fairy-princess aura and Sandlers cave-man charm still complement each other. If its not too old-fashioned to say they seem born for the roles.

Pictures Blended review A bland mix of unfunny and boring 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Blended Comedy. Starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Directed by Frank Coraci. (PG-13. 117 minutes.) Badly made and poorly written ""Blended"" is a rehash of Adam Sandlers 2011 comedy ""Just Go With It"" only without Jennifer Aniston and without laughs. It not only gets the big things wrong. It gets the small easy things wrong. A few examples On several occasions Sandler and Drew Barrymore are shown having a conversation. He says something and she laughs uproariously ... but the audience watches in complete silence. Over and over we have the spectacle of people laughing at each others unfunny jokes. Its like eavesdropping on boring people. Throughout the movie references are made to Sandlers being fat and sloppy but he has actually taken off weight and looks younger and trimmer than he has in years. He doesnt look remotely overweight. Later theres a key scene in which Barrymore walks into a room wearing a flattering dress that knocks everyone out ... except the dress isnt much and she doesnt look any better in it than she does in anything else. These are strange imprecise moments that connote sloppiness. Take an extra half hour to devise a genuinely witty laugh line. If the leading man isnt overweight cut the fat jokes. And if the leading lady has to knock people out invest the time to put her into a decent dress. Another thing Dont go for cheap laughs that undermine the characters. Twice someone suggests that Sandlers character doesnt wash. Thats a nifty detail to be thinking about when watching a romantic comedy. Even the title is ill considered or not considered at all. ""Blended"" refers to blended families as in a parent and children from one family joining up with the parent and children of another family to form something new. But the metaphor calls to mind nothing so much as ""The Collection"" a horror movie in which people are fed into a giant food processor. So Sandler is Jim a widower and Barrymore is Lauren newly divorced and they meet on a blind date at Hooters. Its a disastrous blind date (of course) played for laughs that dont come. She accidentally pours French onion soup onto her blouse - a little slapstick designed to have them rolling in the aisles. At one point when she criticizes Hooters he makes fun of her for being flat-chested then looks down and realizes that she isnt. Its almost a tasteless sight gag ... except the costume designer has Barrymore wearing something so baggy that the line makes no sense. So the tastelessness is preserved but the gag never happens. Then as was the case with Sandler and Aniston in ""Just Go With It"" Jim and Lauren end up going on vacation together to an exotic resort. Its all a big accident sort of. This time the location is Africa so in between comic bits there are shots of giraffes and lions. (Take your pleasures where you can get them.) Here and there time is used up by showing her two sons and his three daughters in various and supposedly emotional situations. Every plot detail can be seen from a mile off but in a romantic comedy thats never a problem. The problem is that what we see off in the distance we dont necessarily like. The script may be the main culprit but there is simply nothing in Sandler and Barrymores interaction to make an audience want to see them together. Moreover its not even clear whod be getting the worst of it. Neither of these actors who have been quite appealing before are particularly winning here and blending them (or sticking them into the same food processor) doesnt help at all. There are not too many movies like ""Blended"" that make acting in motion pictures seem like a dispiriting activity. As a viewer when I pass through unhappiness at sitting there to actual pity for the people on screen something is very wrong. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Pictures shows Terry Crews in a scene from ""Blended."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures) Share PhotoTo say that the new Adam Sandler movie ""Blended"" is better than some of his other recent work -- ""Jack and Jill"" for example -- isnt saying much. After all some natural disasters cause less damage than others. But none are a positive development.OK thats overly harsh to ""Blended"" -- though not to ""Jack and Jill."" But please understand the frustration. Some of us are old enough to recall a time when Sandler made movies that were authentically funny and didnt merely earn laughs by reminding people of their most puerile instincts. We also remember acting work by Sandler that deserved real admiration-- remember the 2002 ""Punch-Drunk Love""? Not to mention some classic moments on ""Saturday Night Live"" -- but now were REALLY dating ourselves.From Sandlers early goofy charming humor weve traveled to a point where were trying to analyze in ""Blended"" whether his mocking of feminine hygiene products is better or worse than his jokes about a young boys sexual explorations or a teen girls futile efforts to boost her flat chest.But theres something else disappointing about ""Blended"" which stars Sandler and Drew Barrymore (in their third collaboration) as single parents thrown together on an African family vacation. The fact is there are actual sparks of sweetness actual moments of tenderness mostly thanks to Barrymores sunny and grounded presence (one shudders to imagine this movie without her) and the relaxed chemistry between the stars. But the moments dont stay sweet. Theyll end with something like Sandler loudly urinating. Or two rhinos copulating. Tee hee.Sandler plays Jim a widower with three daughters who works at a sporting-goods store. Barrymore is Lauren divorced from her narcissistic husband and trying to juggle parenting two boys with running a closet-organizing service with her gal pal (Wendi McLendon-Covey). They first meet on a disastrous blind date. But of course they keep running into each other again.Like at the drugstore where Jim is buying sanitary products for his teen daughter (much hilarity ensues including from the cashier who dishes about her own reproductive system as cashiers so often do when youre checking out) and Lauren is trying to replace a centerfold shes ripped up from her sons girlie magazine.The coincidences keep happening and so eventually and dont ask how -- director Frank Coraci and screenwriters Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera dont lose sleep over plausibility -- Jim and Lauren are both in South Africa not only in the same resort but the same suite Theyre appalled to discover each other there but of course theres much to be learned over the ensuing days about parenting friendship romance family and wildlife.In case we didnt absorb those lessons were reminded of them by our singing -- and bumping and grinding -- musical narrator Terry Crews. Theres also a not-very-funny side-plot involving a leering husband (Kevin Nealon) and a bride who expresses excitement by shaking her boobs (tee hee again). Not surprisingly there is little attempt to depict real Africans.The most promising scenes involve the children especially Jims daughters and their attempts to replace their late mothers presence (although these can veer toward the maudlin). Theres a little blonde moppet called Lou a middle daughter named Espn after the network (OK thats funny) and a tomboy teen named Larry for Hilary (Jim clearly wants sons). Were supposed to believe everyone thinks shes a boy but really? Shes played by glamorous Bella Thorne disguised only by an unattractive haircut but otherwise looking a lot like Keira Knightley.Still when Lauren whos as happy to have daughters around as Jim is to have sons gives Larry/Hilary a makeover at the salon the scene unexpectedly warms the heart. And it reminds us that theres a fairly decent movie trying to breathe here underneath the infantile humor. Maybe one day Sandler will liberate that movie.___""Blended"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America ""for crude and sexual content and language.""

Sandler and Barrymore take a slapstick safari in Blended By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams May 22 2014 (...) Jody Mitori Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler in ""Blended."" ""Blended"" is a rare Adam Sandler movie with a lesson to teach us As soon as people realize youre an incurable jerk play the cancer card.Sandler did it once before in the effective first half of ""Funny People"" where he played a superstar comedian confronting his own mortality. Here he plays widower Jim whose boorish behavior on a blind date with divorced mom Lauren (Drew Barrymore) is presumably excused because hes been left with three kids to raise alone.As usual for the comedies he produces Sandler keeps pooping in the sandbox and he expects the audience to give him a cookie for it. Its a shame that he forces Barrymore to get soiled too. Barrymore co-starred in one of Sandlers better movies ""The Wedding Singer."" Like this one it was directed by Sandlers pal Frank Coraci who slid downhill with the Kevin James vehicles ""The Zookeeper"" and ""Here Comes the Boom.""""Blended"" is slightly more watchable than Sandlers previous movies ""Jack and Jill"" ""Thats My Boy"" and ""Grown Ups 2."" The secret is to close one eye and concentrate on Barrymore whos got actual acting talent in her genes. And occasionally we get to see African wildlife.How Lauren and her two sons end up sharing a South African honeymoon suite with Jim and his three daughters is not worth explaining. But whoever surrounded the bickering tourists with bug-eyed black minstrels and an exclusively white clientele should be hauled before a judge. The semblance of a plot is that teen daughter Hilary (Bella Thorne) is continually mistaken for a boy when shes trying to flirt with a cut-rate Robert Pattinson (Zak Henri). And the tween daughter with the implausible name Espn (Emma Fuhrmann) insists on chatting with her dead mother in the empty seat at every dinner table.Meanwhile Laurens older son Brendan (Braxton Beckham) is obsessed with boobies and young Tyler (Kyle Red Silverstein) hates himself for his lack of coordination. Fortunately Jim is both proficient with porn and an employee at a sporting-goods store (whose name is a stupid running gag and an obvious product placement). Like something coughed up by a baby ""Blended"" is tasteless mush.What ""Blended""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 157  Content Crude and sexual content and strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Comments click to enlarge Blended Video Rated PG-13  117 minutes  2014 In this bawdy ugly farce a widowed father (Adam Sandler) goes on a disastrous blind date with a single mom (Drew Barrymore) only to wind up sharing a hotel room with her when their families are accidentally booked on the same African vacation. As their dysfunctional kids bond the two gradually fall for each other; the film is sweet in stretches but screenwriters Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera deflate every sentimental gesture with a sophomoric quip. Unlike comic greats Groucho Marx and Jerry Lewis who deflected sincerity with style and impudence Sandler is simply cruel; his movies would be more likable if the jokes werent so mean-spirited and the characters such sexist and racist caricatures.

"Blended (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Blended (PG-13) Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore reunite for this pleasant amusing bauble. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com5/22/2014 Editor rating 2.5 Adam Sandler has been on a roll lately -- making some of the worst laziest most witless comedies of all time. So to discover that Blended is amusing and even a little bit sweet comes as the best sort of shock after the atrocities perpetrated by Grown Ups 2 Thats My Boy and Jack and Jill. Of course Sandler benefits from his best co-star here (Drew Barrymore) who worked with him on 50 First Dates and The Wedding Singer and hes also got Wedding Singer director Frank Coraci on board. Also theres a script and Brady Bunch-esque though it might be at least there is a script. Theres still some question as to whether Grown Ups 2 even bothered to slap one together. Sandler and Barrymore star as Jim and Lauren single parents who go on a spectacularly bad blind date (for starters he takes her to Hooters though not for the reasons you might think). Hes a widower with three tomboyish daughters; shes divorced from a slick jerk (Joel McHale) and raising two hellion boys without a lot of help. But nothing ignites between them except frustration disgust and contempt. They run into each other in a drugstore one night and cant even end that encounter on a polite note. Then one breakup of mutual friends and much willing suspension of disbelief later Jim and Lauren and their kids all end up sharing a suite on a trip to Africa the purpose of which is to celebrate ""blended"" families. Neither Jim nor Lauren wants to do anything together but the price is right and they figure at least the kids will have fun. You dont need me to tell you what happens over the course of the week but to the movies credit it manages just the right balance of slapstick and sentimentality. This isnt high-brow or intelligent humor but there are plenty of funny bits here including an increasingly bizarre Terry Crews and a group of singers who periodically pop up as a sort of Greek chorus while Jim and Lauren bond with each others kids and start to eye one another with curiosity instead of animosity. Sandler and Barrymore have a nice comic chemistry which is not an incidental; its a requirement for romantic comedy and way too many rom coms fall apart without it). There are a couple of touching moments but true to form any mushy stuff is swiftly overshadowed by a joke. Blended isnt Sandlers funniest movie or his best but it is a big step up from the dregs hes been churning out a messy shaggy dog of a comedy that you cant help but like even as it sheds all over your house. Cast Adam Sandler Drew Barrymore Wendi McLendon-Covey Terry Crews Kevin Nealon Bella Thorne. Director Frank Coraci. Screenwriters Ivan Menchell Clare Sera. A Warner Bros. release. Running time 117 minutes. Crude and sexual content and language. Opens Friday May 23 at area theaters.

TWITTER In their third onscreen pairing Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore play single parents who find themselves sharing a family vacation in Africa. There are cellphones one or two fleeting acknowledgments of same-sex couples and other signs of the 21st century in Blended but in essence the latest Adam Sandler movie is as old-school a family rom-com as Yours Mine and Ours (either version). Embodying the same wholesomeness that has informed most of his screen work gross-out comedies included it feels like a tentative next step in Sandlers evolving screen persona one that has gone from good-hearted dolt to bumbling man-child to middle-aged father. The feature reunites the actor with Drew Barrymore and director Frank Coraci who helmed the leads first pairing The Wedding Singer nearly 20 years ago. As in that film and their last outing 50 First Dates Sandler and Barrymore display an onscreen connection that lends a grounding warmth to the clunkiest comedy setups -- in this case a narrative that places two single parents on an African vacation as second date. Unenthusiastic reviews aside the lead duo will be a strong draw for audiences who arent keen on superhero action of the X-Men variety. The movie opens with a blind date between the two main characters thats a disaster not just for them but for the audience every intended joke landing with a thud. Sporting-goods salesman Jim a widower and freelance closet organizer Lauren recently divorced are just getting back into the dating game. Neither is trying especially hard when they get together at a Hooters -- a seemingly damning choice of location for Jim but one that screenwriters Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera later reveal to have sentimental meaning without pushing the matter. PHOTOS Comedians in Dramatic Roles However awful Lauren and Jims first meeting its clear that these devoted parents are meant for each other as their matching minivans attest. Their next run-in a second-chance meet-cute at a drugstore clicks as comedy and insightful dramatic development. Hes there for his teen daughter Hilary (Disney Channel star Bella Thorne) whom the sports-minded Jim treats like an athlete of no particular gender persuasion complete with unflattering barbershop do. In a kind of parental symmetry Lauren is at the store to replace a girly magazine that she impulsively destroyed after discovering it under the bed of her older son (Braxton Beckham). Barrymore is especially good at conveying her characters entangled feminist disgust and humanist forgiveness. That winning scene aside Coraci indulges in a bit too much stateside setup before the action shifts to its main setting the African continent -- to be precise a mildly adventurous South African resort that might be called Africa Land or Africa World and which feels like being stuck on an overprogrammed cruise. Jim Lauren and their broods share a super-fancy suite with a view -- the result of semiconvincing plot contortions involving a dashed romantic getaway for Laurens child-averse business partner (Wendi McLendon-Covey). PHOTOS Thats My Boy Premiere Draws Sandler Spade ... and Vanilla Ice Antagonists though they may be theyre smack in the middle of the resorts annual celebration of the blended family a ""familymoon"" event thats designed with lots of activities for kids and romantic opportunities for grownups. Avoiding the latter Lauren and Jim keep busy on the family-friendly front. Amid such shrill escapades as a balloon crash-landing over a rhinoceros they very predictably mentor each others children Jim coaches the baseball-challenged Tyler (Kyle Red Silverstein) and Lauren coaxes the frustrated Hilary into a glamorous makeover. The kids all well played dont interact as siblings; their main purpose is to represent facets of parenthood both positive and negative. The action is by turns insistently sunny and mawkish. Jims alternately sweet and in a bit of overdone shtick demonic youngest daughter (Alyvia Alyn Lind) instigates a ""What do you miss about Mommy?"" conversation and his middle girl (Emma Fuhrmann) -- who has the honor of being named Espn after the cable network -- still communes with her mother insisting on a place for her at the dinner table. Supporting roles are of the broadly drawn and mostly thankless sort. Kevin Nealon plays a middle-aged vacationer whos blind to the tension between his cleavage-heavy young wife (Jessica Lowe) and his teenage son (Zak Henri). As the resort social director Mfana Abdoulaye Ngom must deliver some corny lines with conviction. Stateside Shaquille ONeal is called upon to do some belly-dancing as Jims coworker while Joel McHale fills the role of Laurens ex a self-involved no-show dad whose every move only emphasizes Jims goodness. The connect-the-dots proceedings get some much-needed punctuation -- or interruption -- from Terry Crews who flexes (pectoral) muscle as the wide-eyed ultra-exuberant lead singer of the resorts Thathoo Harmony Group. Like all routines in the film though it repeats itself rather than venture into fresher and funnier territory. Coraci whose past outings with Sandler include Click and The Waterboy keeps things moving but rarely gets a comic pulse revving. The production shot in Georgia and South Africa by Julio Macat with colorful design contributions from Perry Andelin Blake and Christine Wada is solid the most striking images being brief footage of animals encountered on the families safari -- by far the wildest element in this family-friendly adventure.

"Blended Review Third Time Lacks Adam Sandler-Drew Barrymore Charm | Variety Variety Continue to Variety () Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Blended Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 13 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr May 22 2014 | 0437AM PT Third time lacks charm for Adam Sandler-Drew Barrymore reunion undercutting sincere moments with numbskull gags. Theres a scene midway through the Adam Sandler-Drew Barrymore vehicle ""Blended"" that sees the two stars playing single parents thrust together on a South African resort accidentally meet up for morning coffee. They dont say much commiserating over their respective kids sleeping habits but what they do say is believable radiating an unhurried unforced chemistry thats enough to make one wonder why these two actors have only made three movies together over the past 16 years. Then they gaze out toward the resort grounds and witness two poorly rendered CGI rhinos copulating with great vigor. Cut to a shot of the barista addressing the camera with a Catskills smirk ""You dont see that in New Jersey"" This scene serves as a perfect microcosm for the film as a whole which should see solid if unspectacular family business over Memorial Day weekend. Granted that sequence is the only one in the film that includes a direct rupture of the fourth-wall or a depiction of wildlife mating or any mention at all of New Jersey but it nonetheless epitomizes the pics perverse instinct to undercut its own charms at every opportunity. Reuniting Sandler and Barrymore for the first time in a decade and the pair with director Frank Coraci for the first time since ""The Wedding Singer"" ""Blended"" suffers from a fundamental lack of trust in its audience following every unexpectedly smart exchange with a numbskull pratfall or one-liner and every instance of genuine sincerity with an avalanche of schmaltz. Unquestionably an improvement over recent Sandler efforts like ""Grown Ups 2"" ""Jack and Jill"" and ""Just Go With It"" -- which to be fair were all truly vile ""death of cinema"" sorts of affairs -- the film is all the more disappointing for having actual potential to squander. Here Sandler plays Jim a widowed everyman sporting goods seller with three daughters while Barrymore tackles the role of Lauren an interior decorator who specializes in closets and a divorced mother to two boys. The two meet for a disastrous blind date at Hooters in the films opening scene after which they resolve never to speak to one another again. In no time they randomly meet again at a drugstore then meet again thanks to an odd credit card mixup then meet once more at a fabulous resort in South Africa with each claiming the same assumed identity forcing the two -- and their children -- to bunk up in the same suite for a week. This laborious setup takes at least 45 minutes of screen time to get through and it may well go down as the most boring extended stretch in Sandlers entire filmography. Screenwriters Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera seem problematically aware of how unlikely this central scenario must seem and thus spend an exhausting amount of time explaining every little step. This will not be the first time the film screeches to a halt in order to address potential structural problems that arent particularly important creating bigger issues in the process. Once they finally arrive in Africa (and rarely do the characters refer to their current location with any more specificity than that) Jim and Lauren gradually start to catch on that theyre perfect for one another while the huge communal brood struggles to make nice while sorting out their own individual issues. Jims children include teenage Hillary (Bella Thorne) eternally mistaken for a boy despite her supermodel good looks on account of a slightly masculine haircut; Espn (Emma Fuhrmann) who believes she can still communicate with her dead mother a strange quirk that will be ruthlessly exploited to jerk a few tears later on; and youngster Lou (Alyvia Alyn Lind) who suffers from a near toxic excess of cuteness. On Laurens end Jake (Braxton Beckham) is a chronic masturbator (otherwise known as a 13-year-old boy) while Tyler (Kyle Red Silverstein) is having trouble with his baseball skills -- if only there were a potential father figure around to teach him. In general the film is at its absolute worst when it tries to shoehorn in bits of schtick which rarely arise organically out of the narrative. A painfully unfunny throwaway gag in which Lauren and her business partner (Wendi McLendon-Cobey) are mistaken for lesbians for example requires no fewer that three otherwise inexplicable bits of extended exposition just to set up and hardly elicits a half-chuckle when the punchline arrives. The harder the film tries to wring out a laugh the more awkwardly it whiffs which makes it all the more puzzling that Sandler and Barrymores far looser seemingly unscripted banter isnt afforded more screentime. Though her character here is little more than a standard-issue fretful fussbudget Barrymore brings the best out of Sandler whenever shes granted a little leeway. One has to give ""Blended"" some credit though. It is after all among the rare Sandler pics that feature no farting pooping or vomiting of any kind. (And its lone urination gag is actually pretty funny) It also passes the Bechdel test with flying colors giving female characters decent screentime together. And breaking from the long string of projects in which Sandler exclusively limned successful super-rich sexually alluring characters harassed by their socioeconomic inferiors his character here is thoroughly middle class and believably harried giving the films inherently conservative family-focused agenda a welcome grounding in something resembling reality. Popping up in smaller roles Kevin Nealon and Jessica Lowe have some decent lines as randy fellow vacationers though Terry Crews steals the most scenes as an insinuating South African lounge singer who appears throughout as a sort of sleazy Greek chorus. (Aside from Crews and Abdoulaye NGoms hotel activities manager actual African characters function purely as props here -- which is disappointing though one could argue thats how they likely appear to rich Westerners on luxury package tours in real life too.) On a technical level the filmmaking is at times surprisingly sloppy with a few noticeably mismatched edits poorly focused shots and imperfectly synced dialogue. Locations however are well-scouted.

In fact your review might actually make it funnier for me. Thanks Reply Pat Lopez says May 26 2014 at 653 am Wow The writer of this article is a hater without objectivity. CMON Its Adam Sandler. Hes a comedian. What do you expect from him? And Drew - shes amazing to watch. The movie was hilarious - as it was intended to be and I really enjoyed it. Reply Marilyn Andrews says May 27 2014 at 959 am I agree Reply connie says May 24 2014 at 413 pm I have to say I saw the movie and thought it was very entertaining. I laughed and loved the scenery.

I mean its a kids movie too and they dd a good job of entertaining Reply Whisper Proud says May 23 2014 at 1033 am Sandler has never been funny a tragic comedian much along the ""Jerry Lewis"" style. What I can not understand is why Barrymore lends her talent to this flick or any flick she has made with Sandler. Then again she may be a late bloomer for the ""A"" lister status. Reply rocky-o says May 22 2014 at 921 pm love drew but cant stand sandler...when are they gonna stop giving him roles that could actually go to those who could make something of them... Reply MJOSSIE says May 26 2014 at 618 am I read this and I must reply. Adam Sandler gets the roles because the movies are produced by Happy Madison productions which Adam Sandler is the founder of . So of course he will be in those movies because each are his projects. Overall I think he did a fantastic job. Very funny guy Reply Ian Berkshire says May 22 2014 at 951 am I think it looks good. And any movie that has Shaquille oneal in it is going to be funny. Reply Ulkar Alakbarova says May 22 2014 at 552 am I like Drew. She is excellent actress. I dont really like Adam Sandler but i have to admit both Drew and Adam have a special chemistry on the screen.

Share Tweet Blended opens on the floor of a Hooters womens restroom as the camera creeps under the stalls and past squirming panty-wrapped ankles. Because the movie is a latter-day Adam Sandler vehicle regular viewers (and critics assigned to the Sandler beat) cant help but assume that it will only get cruder from here. It doesnt. Tame by Sandlers current standards the movie feels like a throwback; it brings to mind the blandly crappy movies Sandler made 10 years ago rather than the brazenly crappy movies he makes today. In that sense its a double disappointment neither consistently funny nor endurance-testing.  Sandler--clad in his usual ""Who cares?"" uniform of extra-large T-shirts cargo shorts and black socks--plays Jim a widower and father of three who manages a Dicks Sporting Goods franchise. (No Happy Madison production is complete without a little brand integration.) The movie begins with Jim fumbling through a disastrous blind date with Lauren (Drew Barrymore) a divorced professional closet organizer--a job seemingly invented for reality TV shows and romantic comedies--and mother of two. Jim and Lauren go their separate ways but continue running into each other. Eventually they and their five cumulative children end up booked into the same suite at a South African resort during a weeklong event designed for the newly re-married to get better acquainted with their stepchildren. How they end up booked into the same suite doesnt really matter; it involves Laurens deadbeat ex-husband (Joel McHale) more Dicks Sporting Goods ""integration"" and some finagling that the movie never bothers to depict or explain. What matters is that Lauren and Jim end up assigned to the same meal-time tables and tour groups and that Jim has to spend the whole trip pretending that his last name is ""Theodopolous."" The movies South African middle hour plays like a less misanthropic Nick Swardson-free variation on Sandlers 2011 Cactus Flower remake Just Go With It. Jim and Lauren bond with each others kids (his all girls hers all boys) get mistaken for a married couple and spend a lot of time sitting around catalog-lit hotel rooms and dining areas. (The resort by the way is the notorious Sun City.) As is often the case with Sandlers later work the viewer gets the impression that the movie is little more than an excuse for Sandler and his friends (including Kevin Nealon and Shaquille ONeal) and family (Sandlers wife children and mother all have credited speaking roles) to go on a paid vacation.Every crummy new Sandler flick inevitably raises the question of whether the star holds his audience in contempt with each movies cheap bathos unfunny gags pervasive product placement and amateurish direction serving as the evidence. With the likes of Jack And Jill--an extended anti-comic ad for Dunkin Donuts--the answer seems to be yes. But with a film like Blended the answer is less clear. Shoddiness has always been an integral part of Sandlers comedy (see for example Carl Weathers fake hand in Happy Gilmore). At its best it turns the act of making a joke into a joke in and of itself. At its worst it suggests total apathy.  Its true that Blended has its share of apathetic filmmaking. As in all Sandler vehicles the pacing is atrocious and a large chunk of the dialogue consists of family drama boilerplate injected with broad pop-culture references based on an actors appearance. (Two different people refer to Laurens eldest son as ""Frodo."") Theres some business involving a black cap-sleeve Alexander McQueen dress that supposedly turns Lauren into the sexiest woman anyone has ever seen but in reality looks bland and unflattering. Sloppiness abounds; this is the kind of movie where the contents of a glass change from water to champagne depending on the angle. But there are also occasional flashes of something resembling comedy most of which come from resort concierge Mfana (Happy Madison regular Abdoulaye NGom) and the singing dancing Brechtian narrator played by Terry Crews. Reunited with The Wedding Singer director Frank Coraci Barrymore and Sandler give Lauren and Jim the dynamic of an old couple. This being an Adam Sandler movie though their closeness only ends up making the whole thing seem shoddier because it makes their dislike for each other seem totally unmotivated.

Photo Warner Bros. MOVIE REVIEW Blended Running time 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexual situations crude humor profanity). At the E-Walk the Kips Bay the Lincoln Square others At a tender interlude in ""Blended"" an adorable motherless little girl asks a sweet lady to rub her head while she goes to sleep ""so I have good dreams."" The moment shatters with the sound of Adam Sandlers character peeing outside the door. If ""Funny People"" is any indication Sandler hates himself and in ""Blended"" he invites us to join him. Invitation accepted In an early scene widower Jim (Sandler) a father of three girls has a blind date with a divorcee named Lauren (Drew Barrymore) whos raising two boys. He drinks her beer looks at the TV when shes talking and insults her job -- and yet in the movie we will discover that shes the one who needs to learn (not to dress like a prairie schoolmarm and not to be so uptight). Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore tackle their next big-screen adventure in ""Blended.""Photo Warner Bros. Also were supposed to think that despite his naming one daughter Espn (after ESPN) and dressing his girls in a way that could charitably be described as ""sporty Amish"" Jims actually sensitive Because his dead wife used to work at that very same Hooters. Aww man. Hand me a tissue Ive got something in my eye. Jim and Lauren both wind up in Africa for the following reason Her best friend is going there with her boyfriend except the friend bails at the last minute when she finds out her beau has five kids and theyre coming too. Oh and her boyfriend is Jims boss. Simultaneously but without either knowing the others intentions Jim and Lauren each buy half the vacation from the couple who wont be needing it. Drew Barrymore takes a ride through Africa in ""Blended.""Photo Warner Bros. Happens all the time. Imagine the pitch meeting Its ""The Brady Bunch"" only in Africa Why Africa? Because we want to have a scene where an African driver is so dumb he runs out of gas while Drew Barrymore is parasailing behind him and a rhino is on the loose right under her Barrymore is still cute and she and Sandler at least seem to like each other as they get on with the grim business of rom-com contrivance Hey they drive identical white minivans They take their coffee the same way too. These two are made for each other. All they need is for Jim to hire a band of monkeys to play ""Careless Whisper."" While he was at it Sandler should have hired them to punch up the script.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 246 p.m. MST May 21 2014Adam Sandler teams with Drew Barrymore again this time as a couple who have a disastrous first date but wind up vacationing in South Africa together. Not as bad as youd think but stupid. Drew Barrymore (left) and Adam Sandler in a scene from ""Blended."" Credit Warner Bros. Pictures. (Photo Warner Bros. Pictures )Story HighlightsCritics review 2 starsThere are glimpses of real emotion in some scenes particularly between Sandler and Barrymore.Sandler however and the filmmakers resort to silliness at every turn.Sandler shows glimpses of his talent but doesnt trust the audience for long.""Blended"" is an Adam Sandler movie that isnt as bad as you feared it would be.Granted that sets the bar pretty low. Sandler is capable of making wretched films such exercises in arrogant laziness and self-absorption as the ""Grown Ups"" movies where he just hangs out with his real-life friends. ""Blended"" directed by Frank Coraci and written by Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera isnt as bad as that.In fact at times it threatens to make you forget its a Sandler comedy (""comedy"" might be more accurate) with some moments of real sweetness followed by for instance a shot of rhinos having sex.""You wont see that in New Jersey"" a resort employee says by way of punch line and no probably not. Didnt really want to see it in South Africa either thanks. Whatever the case Sandler and his team work tirelessly to provide constant reminders that despite whatever the film might have going for it you cant escape the fact that its still a stupid Adam Sandler movie.Sandler plays Jim a widower with three daughters he is raising as if they were boys. He goes on a blind date with Lauren (Drew Barrymore) a divorced mother of two boys. The date which opens the film is disastrous from the couples point of view but its one of the better scenes in the film. (This is the third time Sandler and Barrymore have made a movie together and the easy comfort they have with one another shows.)A far-fetched plot development allows Jim and his kids to wind up sharing the same luxury suite at a resort in South Africa as Lauren and her children. Sure. Whatever. Theyre sworn enemies but cmon theyre Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. How long till the ice thaws?While we wait we see some stunning shots of South Africa that dont involve mating wildlife along with set pieces that range from the mildly charming to the insipid; many of the latter involve Nickens (Terry Crews) and his roaming band of singers who serve as a type of idiot Greek chorus but instead of helping explain whats going on they merely describe what we already know because we just saw it happen.Fitting. Trust in the audience is not a hallmark of the filmmakers. If it were then maybe they could allow at least one semiserious scene to play out without beating us over the head with a trademark silly Sandler gag. Its like following a gourmet dinner with a McFlurry (except a McFlurry possesses certain guilty charms).Sandler is frustrating. In ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and ""Funny People"" he proved he can be an engaging actor. But the bulk of what he makes is cash-grab comedies. And on one level why not? Hes been so financially successful with these that theyll probably put his face on some sort of currency designated for spending on projects beneath ones talents. Yet in ""Blended"" when he is with Barrymore or the actresses playing his daughters we see glimpses of poignancy.But they dont last. Its as if he and his collaborators are worried the audience might feel something.Cut to the rhinos alas.Review Blended 2 starsDirector Frank Coraci.Cast Adam Sandler Drew Barrymore Kevin Nealon.Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content and language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday May 22 2014 1101 AM Title Blended Film Info With Adam Sandler Drew Barrymore. Single parents are pushed together on vacation. Director Frank Coraci (157). PG-13 Crude humor sexuality language. Area theaters. Before you spend good money to see the purported comedy ""Blended"" watch the trailer. The entire movie is packed into those 152 seconds -- so if you laugh at every ""Men Are From Mars Women Are from Venus"" joke and slapstick pratfall by all means pay for more of the same. The rest of us can spend our Memorial Day weekends seeing better films and wondering why Hollywood is still making the same boneheaded rom-coms year after year after year. In the case of Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler the partnership started out so well with ""The Wedding Singer"" in 1998. Their next effort ""50 First Dates"" (2004) offered diminishing returns -- and this third attempt at making Barrymore and Sandler a comic franchise is an unmitigated disaster. Frank Coraci who directed ""The Wedding Singer"" seems so sure his stars will draw audiences that he takes the easiest route whenever possible. The same goes for screenwriters Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera who paint strictly by numbers. Barrymore plays Lauren an uptight but devoted divorced mom of two boys. Sandler is Jim the slovenly but devoted widowed dad to three girls. They go on a disastrous blind date at his favorite restaurant (that would be Hooters) and swear theyll never see each other again. Director Frank Coraci seems so sure his stars will draw audiences that he takes the easiest route whenever possible. But this is a movie so the families wind up at the same South African hotel just days later -- wouldnt you know? -- and the feud expands to the kids too. If youve ever been inside a multiplex before you can guess what happens during their vacation. Sure it would be nice if the filmmakers gave us a few surprises before the happy ending. Whats worse though is how low their comic bar is set. The cartoonish African characters -- including some played by Terry Crews and Abdoulaye NGom -- exist solely to serve and observe the Americans. Jims daughter (Bella Thorne) is ridiculed for her tomboyish looks until she endures a glam makeover. Lauren and her best friend (Wendi McLendon-Covey) are mocked as lesbians. Jim is repeatedly praised for being ""awesome"" while Lauren is regularly advised to loosen up. It hardly helps that the pacing is so stilted and the editing so poor that the actors often seem to be shooting the same scene at different times. Coraci doesnt help Barrymore at all yet she works very hard to keep us interested. Sandler is not as engaged but his low-key vibe balances the frantic energy of a movie trying to generate laughs without any punchlines. At least they earned a safari for their troubles.
