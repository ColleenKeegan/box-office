B- My Dog Skip Genre Drama Comedy; Starring Kevin Bacon Frankie Muniz Diane Lane Luke Wilson; Director Jay Russell; Author Willie Morris; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 21 2000 -- 1200 AM EST Heres a passage from the late Willie Morris 1995 memoir My Dog Skip ""Cruising through the fringes of town I would spot a group of old men standing around up the road. I would get Skip to prop himself against the steering wheel...while I crouched out of sight under the dashboard.... As we drove by the Blue Front Cafe I could hear one of the men shout Look at that ol dog drivin a car"" The dry humane grace of that scene is exactly what doesnt make it into director Jay Russells big-screen adaptation of My Dog Skip. Instead we get a serviceable time-passer for kids grandparents and poochophiles that feints toward the toughness of To Kill a Mockingbird but stays well within Hallmark-homily territory. As young Willie Malcolm in the Middles Frankie Muniz looks uncomfortable without any irony to latch on to and a subplot about the black denizens of WWII-era Yazoo Miss. is dropped before it can threaten to develop an edge. Worst of all the Jack Russell playing Skip is allowed to mug a la Frasiers Eddie instead of behaving like an actual canine.

The perennial boy-and-his-dog story receives elegiac treatment in ""My Dog Skip"" a tender if overly sentimental version of Mississippi author Willie Morris 1995 boyhood memoir. Alternately evoking rich reflective memories of the 1940s Deep South and succumbing to obvious nostalgia and drama to keep things pumping for a contempo aud the Warners release -- completed in time for Morris to view it before his death in August -- has been unaccountably held out of circulation until now. Flaws and all this is superior family entertainment in the tradition of quality that co-producer Mark Johnson (""A Little Princess"") has long championed. But because it is live-action rather than animated and overlaid with a literary sensibility kids may be less moved than their parents. This plus a misleading PG rating which may dampen kiddie turnout will result at best in mid-level B.O. In adapting Morris slim episodic volume tyro feature scribe and ex-journalist Gail Gilchriest sometimes struggles to find dramatic through-lines. While Morris adult voice makes an immediate presence care of Harry Connick Jr.s ""Thin Red Line""-like narration story tries to establish young Willie (Frankie Muniz) as an 8-year-old weakling endlessly pummeled by neighborhood bullies led by Big Boy Wilkinson (Bradley Coryell). Willies world without friends his own age is highlighted when mother Ellen (Diane Lane) and father Jack (Kevin Bacon) arrange his ninth birthday party and the boy has no one to invite. Willies only pal is sports stud Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson). But Dink is of draft age and quickly goes off with fellow Yazoo Miss. recruits to fight Hitler. Ellen though lifts Willies spirits with a birthday gift of Skip a smart rambunctious English fox terrier (six Jack Russells superbly trained by Mathilde De Cagny and William S. Grisco). Jack who lost a leg in the Spanish Civil War and is overly protective of his only son at first doesnt allow Skip to stay warning Ellen that dogs die and are thus ""a heartbreak waiting to happen."" In one of pics rare adult exchanges Ellen counters that taking responsibility for a pet is a way for their son to grow up. Ensuing chain of episodes proves Ellen correct in sometimes effective sometimes obvious ways. Though often poetic the narration occasionally tells us what we can see which is that Skip -- whom Morris describes in the book as having ""an inborn sense of possibility and adventure"" -- leads Willie into a wider sphere of life experience from proving his manhood in a cemetery initiation with Big Boys gang to falling in puppy love with adorable Rivers Applewhite (Caitlin Wachs). While pic is glorious in displays of pure unabashed Americana as when Willie presents Dinks gift of a German helmet and gun belt in a show-and-tell for classmates or when the boy simply trots through the Ol Miss woods with loyal Skip it seriously falters when things turn dramatic or cute. Dinks inglorious discharge for cowardice is effectively conveyed through town rumor-mongering but eventual confrontation between Willie and his hero falls far short of the mark as do awkward action set pieces involving moonshiners. Willies parents also curiously vanish from much of pic -- a loss given the combined talents of Lane and Bacon. Under Jay Russells direction pics shifts from dark to ultra-whimsical are too sudden making cutaways and bits involving Skips darling side nearly as manipulative as the William Ross score drowning in Copland-esque sap. This is a story in which humans play second fiddle to a dog that achieves the symbolic value of a force of nature. Yarns denouement with grown Willie leaving home and arthritic Skip aging before our eyes is exceptionally affecting. No less moving is Muniz able to convey silently a wide range of feelings with uncommonly natural ease -- and a stark contrast to his turn as wisenheimer Malcolm on new Fox series ""Malcolm in the Middle."" The child actor not unlike Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"" puts the rest of the cast in the far background. Tech credits especially James L. Carters fine lensing and David J. Bombas detailed design work are top-notch all the way. My Dog SkipProductionA Warner Bros. release of an Alcon Entertainment presentation of a Mark Johnson/John Lee Hancock production.

Starring Frankie Muniz Kevin Bacon Diane Lane Luke Wilson. Directed by Jay Russell. (PG. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) From ""Lassie"" to ""Old Yeller"" and even the wacky ""Beethoven"" there have been wonderful sometimes heartrending movies about kids and dogs -- solid family entertainment. Add to the heartrending list ""My Dog Skip"" opening today at Bay Area theaters. Though its sentiment may be lost on the very young the movie is strictly two-hanky fare. The boy-dog formula takes viewers to surprising places and ends up an enchanting character study. In spite of its sappiness this tender nostalgia film is seductive. Viewers old enough to remember small town America in the 1940s -- may weep but there are plenty of laughs as well. And there are enough emotional layers to keep the movie from wearing thin. Photographed like a beautiful telescopic glance at Rockwellian Americana Southern- style ""My Dog Skip"" is based on the best-selling 1995 memoir by the late Mississippi writer Willie Morris. His reverie ruminates on a 9-year-old whose best friend is a whip-smart terrier Skip. Both boy and dog are memorable in the film. Frankie Muniz with vulnerability and wide-eyed innocence charms as young Willie. The role is a disarmingly warm departure from the more attitude-sharp character he plays on TVs ""Malcolm in the Middle."" The dog so cute and on cue that one suspects at times hes a wind-up toy is a Jack Russell terrier (six were used in filming). Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane give inspired performances as Willies parents but are ultimately nudged into the background. Willie is an awkward introspective grade school boy the only child of Ellen and Jack Morris. Dad is a stern war vet who lost a leg in battle and is overprotective of Willie. Its 1942. The little town of Yazoo Miss. seems light years away from the dark events unfolding in Europe but when wiry baseball star Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson) a local hero is called up for service the shadow of those events is effectively cast. Dink is Willies neighbor idol and mentor and Willie doesnt want him to go away. As the boys ninth birthday arrives his mom is keenly aware of his loneliness. Dink is shipping out and the introverted bookworm Willie has few friends. The neighborhood bullies push him around and kids dont even show up for his birthday party. Mom figuring that a puppy would help and does an end around the disapproval of Dad who warns that a dog is ""a heartbreak waiting to happen."" Willie and pup bond instantly and the kid sums up his affection by saying ""Im an only child and youre an only dog."" Its the first splash of sentiment -- time to get a hankie ready for misty eyes. An occasional mugging straining-for-laughs tone hurts the film and director Jay Russell tests plausibility with contrived sight gags. But as Willie and Skip roam the town encountering humanity the world opens up to them. The spongy bounce of a childs innocence against a world touched by war racism alcohol abuse violence and other problems is handled deftly and with a compassionate sense that a childs dreams inevitably and sadly must fade. Very young children may not comprehend the emotional fuss but they have the adorable dog to watch. A couple of intense scenes -- one in a graveyard at night another when hunters shoot a deer -- may upset small kids. ..
