He may have narrowly missed the chance to be the first but in 1972 Navy-pilot-turned-astronaut Gene Cernan became - thus far - the last human to walk on the moon. He recounts his exploits in this enjoyable efficient doc alongside reminiscences from lunar luminaries like mission controller Gene Kranz and Apollo 13 captain Jim Lovell. Illustrated with family snaps and home movie footage these tales of remarkable men in extraordinary times are the heart of the film. Cernan covers everything from being measured for his first space suit to losing close friends in the Apollo 1 disaster while his memories of the moon landing itself come close to poetry. Director Mark Craig has an annoying tendency to enhance the narrative with creaky Mad Men-style animated sequences and overbearing music. If ever a story needed no embellishment its this. Still Cernans life is well worth celebrating.

Films like The Martian Gravity and Interstellar have cleaned up at the box office and at awards shows in just the past three years finding success in following the adventures of a singular astronaut in outer space. But all three of those astronauts were fictional Gene Cernan is the real deal. The Last Man on the Moon is both the story of one man as well as the story of a major national experiment. The documentary follows the life of Navy pilot-turned-NASA astronaut Eugene Cernan the most recent person to set foot on the moon as a part of Apollo 17 in 1972. The film opens in the approximate present showing Cernan sporting a cowboy hat watching a bull rider at a rodeo. Gradually the bucking bronco transforms into a whirring astronaut training machine in Cernans mind. Its this juxtaposition of cutting edge space travel and down-to-Earth charm that help the film tell its story of both superhuman adventure and human relationships and struggles. These two themes perfectly coalesce later in the film when Cernan writes his daughters name on the surface of the moon. While much of Cernans personal life and his stories of the space program during its heyday in the 60s and 70s are enlightening and entertaining (apparently the astronauts had very wild parties together back in the day) some of the more technical elements of his career can become tedious for viewers who arent obsessed with the history of the space travel. Still as an established public speaker to this day Cernan knows how to spin a great yarn and if you do zone out for a moment he can quickly reel you back in with the time he nearly died on his Gemini 9 mission or the surprisingly fierce politics behind his being chosen for the Apollo 10 crew.

Gene Cernan is one of them. An astronaut on the final moon voyage Apollo 17 he is the subject of ""Last Man on the Moon"" a documentary that tells his story -- a personal story that illuminates an important period of scientific and cultural history. In presenting Cernans saga director Mark Craig isnt content to piece together talking heads and archival footage. This is not one of those documentaries that you could watch blindfolded and get the whole point. Instead Craig uses the visuals to remind us of the remarkable vistas provided by space travel and the expanded possibilities the broadening of consciousness they provided. NASAs moon program was more than a scientific endeavor. It was the imaginative foundation for ""Star Wars"" ""Star Trek"" and half the sci-fi movies that dominate summer viewing. Cernan is an interesting guy -- interesting in himself and interesting as a type. Around 80 at the time of filming lean and white-haired hes a particularly American kind of tough guy with Andrew Jackson looks and the bearing of a soldier. You wouldnt mess with him now so you can only imagine what he was like 45 years ago. He has the aura of a man of few words but he can talk -- more to the point he can describe. You will never hear better descriptions of a lunar flight of what its like to walk on the moon or to look out the window and see the Earth or to contemplate home from 240000 miles away. It was a peculiar singular life that of an astronaut. The astronaut families tended to live near each other in Houston and socialize within a tight circle. The movie alludes to wild parties in a way that makes you want to know more. The wives went to the same beauty parlors which probably accounts for the crazy beehive hairdos and they saw each other more than they saw their husbands. When Cernan told his little daughter about going to the moon she just wanted to know when they could go camping together. These ambitious young men were neglectful husbands and fathers. They were also celebrities -- more than celebrities they were international heroes. People wanted to touch them. People hung on their words. One of the most interesting things about Cernan is that despite his stern unflappable aura he was not immune to the temptations of ego. He loved being a big shot. He loved -- apparently still loves -- attention. Such impulses do not make for happy long-term marriages but theyre good for a documentary. The Apollo program had two flights that have gone into legend Apollo 11 because it landed Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moons surface and Apollo 13 because things went really wrong. Cernan was on two of the relatively forgotten Apollo missions and ""Last Man on the Moon"" is a chance to hear about them. Its also a chance to imagine what it must be like to be in Cernans head as he looks back on his life. People always try to tell you about their travels and no one ever wants to listen but youll listen to Cernan. Hes been places. Mick LaSalle is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

"Review The Last Man on the Moon a stellar look at astronaut Gene Cernan - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Last Man on the Moon a stellar look at astronaut Gene Cernan la_et_mn_mini_last_man_moon_movie_review_ NASA / Gravitas Ventures Apollo 17 commander Eugene Cernan is profiled in the documentary ""The Last Man on the Moon."" Apollo 17 commander Eugene Cernan is profiled in the documentary ""The Last Man on the Moon."" (NASA / Gravitas Ventures) Michael Rechtshaffen While many could tell you that the first man who walked on the moon was Neil Armstrong few outside those on pub trivia teams would likely be able to name the last person to take that one small step on NASAs final Apollo mission.British documentary filmmaker Mark Craig rectifies that situation with ""The Last Man on the Moon"" an impressively crafted affectionate portrait of Gene Cernan and by extension the program that concluded with Cernans 1972 Apollo 17 landing. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;Conveyed in first person through the razor-sharp recollections of the now 81-year-old Texas rancher the film traces Cernans career trajectory going back to his days in San Diego as a hot-shot naval aviator blending terrific archival footage with contemporary perspectives to quietly poetic effect. Despite the inherent nostalgic undercurrent Craigs film reveals that bragging rights came with a price -- though Cernan would scratch his daughters initials into the lunar dust the same drive and determination that helped get him there would affect his ability to be an attentive father and husband back on planet Earth as noted by his ex-wife Barbara.With those stirring images set against Cernans articulate often wistful observations and backed by a score thats more elegiac than patriotic ""The Last Man on the Moon"" rewardingly goes beyond simply identifying the man and his ultimate mission.-------------The Last Man on the MoonNo ratingRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesPlaying Laemmle Monica Film Center Santa Monica Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Movies Entertainment NASA Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-capsule-last-man-moon-review-20160226-story.html#nt=oft13a-2gp1,200,manonthemoon4,manonthemoon,latimes

He turns 82 in March. Credit NASA You already know the history told in ""The Last Man on the Moon"" but this story just never grows old.The film a documentary is about Capt. Eugene Cernan who for almost 44 years has held the distinction of being the last human being to step on the moon. It was as part of the Apollo 17 mission in December 1972 his third spaceflight after Gemini IX in 1966 and Apollo 10 in 1969. Photo Eugene Cernan at Amarg Boneyard Tucson. Credit Mark Stewart Productions Captain Cernan who turns 82 in March is an eloquent guide to his own career stretching back to his days as a Navy pilot. Mark Craig the director does a fine job of capturing the competitive camaraderie of the early Apollo days through Captain Cernan and interviews with other astronauts their wives and NASA officials.The image of white crew-cut men and their heavily coifed spouses working and playing together as if the troubles of the 1960s dont exist is a bit of a stereotype but Mr. Craig makes it real here. So when the narrative reaches the 1967 fire that killed three Apollo astronauts the effect is devastating. Beyond the personal loss it injected new uncertainty into the mission.""Arlington cold January day"" Captain Cernan says recalling the funeral. ""I wasnt sure whether they were burying three of our colleagues or whether we were burying the entire Apollo program.""Mr. Craigs filmmaking can be manipulative and Captain Cernans recollections sometimes have the pat feel of anecdotes that have been told too many times. But the film holds your interest nonetheless and refreshingly it doesnt turn into yet another plea to restart a lunar program. Instead Captain Cernan reflects on the personal cost of being an Apollo astronaut the long absences from his daughter; the eventual broken marriage. He vividly remembers that along with his triumphs came regrets.

EntertainmentMovies The Last Man on the Moon an astronauts out-of-this-world life Originally published February 25 2016 at 300 pm Updated February 25 2016 at 1134 am Movie review of ""The Last Man on the Moon"" In this documentary former astronaut Eugene Cernan looks back at a life and career that took him into space three times. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer Eugene Cernan has the lean and lanky look of an Old West plainsman in the mold of Clint Eastwood gazing toward a far horizon. And in ""The Last Man on the Moon"" that horizon is very far off indeed. Its on the moon. And rising over it the Earth a blue marble on black velvet. In ""The Last Man on the Moon"" Cernan 81 is also gazing backward at a life and career that took him into space three times on an Earth orbital mission aboard Gemini 9A in 1966 and twice to the moon. Cernan went there first on Apollo 10 when he and fellow astronaut Thomas Stafford skimmed a few miles above the lunar surface in the Lunar Excursion Module in 1969 in a dress rehearsal for the Apollo 11 landing. In December 1972 he returned aboard Apollo 17 landing this time with Harrison Schmitt. And as this documentarys title attests Cernan was the last man to leave his boot prints in the moons dust. More than 43 years later he still holds the distinction of being the last man on the moon. Movie Review    The Last Man on the Moon a documentary directed by Mark Craig. 95 minutes. Not rated; suitable for general audiences. Sundance Cinemas (21+). Former NASA astronaut Nicholas Patrick will attend the 715 p.m. showing Friday Feb. 26 and answer audience questions afterward. Its a distinction that saddens him. In a scene in which he revisits the now-quiet Apollo launchpad at Kennedy Space Center he contemplates the fact that as yet there are no further missions scheduled to land humans on the moon.

""I almost wish I hadnt come here today."" Using a rich trove of archival footage and interviews with Cernan members of his family other former astronauts and key Apollo mission figures director Mark Craig charts the flight path of Cernans life from his years as a naval aviator flying off aircraft carriers in the late 1950s to his selection as an astronaut in 1963 and his trips into space. He recalls when he got the call from NASA telling him he had made the cut. ""I was just selected for the space program. Wow"" All these years later the moment still stuns him. That feeling of excitement never left him. He likens the experience of viewing the distant Earth in the lunar sky to ""sitting on Gods front porch."" And as he climbed the ladder to the lunar module for the last time he says ""I wanted to stop time This is what it feels like. This is what it looks like."" Or to put it another way Wow.

Mark Craig/Courtesy of Sony hide caption toggle caption Mark Craig/Courtesy of Sony Gene Cernan reflects beside an A-4 Skyhawk from VA113 squadron. Mark Craig/Courtesy of Sony Humans have an easier time remembering the first and last of things than we do the middles. The ends bulge out in our minds becoming signifiers of the whole. So for someone raised in the United States when youre asked to recall the men weve sent to the moon your mind probably goes first to the originals Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Youll perhaps associate their names with the swelling up of pride the nation felt at seeing those boots hit the lunar turf for the first time. If you are a particular space freak perhaps you also know the name Eugene Cernan star of the new documentary The Last Man on the Moon. As the end of the line the one who turned out the lights before he left the moon Cernans familiarity to most of the American public should be on par with Armstrongs and Aldrins. Why he isnt more embedded in our national memory is perhaps yet another sign that Americas interest in its space program had already dwindled significantly by the time he commanded Apollo 17 in 1972. Afterward NASA pivoted from the Apollo missions in favor of the space shuttle which has shut down as well. i Tracy and her astronaut father Eugene Cernan in 1972. Courtesy of NASA hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of NASA Tracy and her astronaut father Eugene Cernan in 1972. Courtesy of NASA Cernans role in the film then is as a one-man eulogy for the space program and all the promises it embodied. Its a daunting task without a proper crew by his side. Sadly the film fails to provide one. Though a welcome cinema corrective to NASAs legacy after last months daft conspiracy-theory comedy Moonwalkers The Last Man veers too much to the side of lionizing its cowboy. The film lovingly recounts Cernans journey from naval aviator to three-time space explorer with the familiar assortment of black-and-white family photos TV news footage and era-appropriate musical cues. But it doesnt offer any narrative we havent already heard from the more famous space stories -- from the infectious hubris of The Right Stuff from the act-of-God morbidity of Apollo 13 and from everything in between. Cernan is certainly a game onscreen presence -- as one would hope considering he shares a co-writing credit (the film is based on his memoir of the same name). The clean-cut 81-year-old chats about his three journeys into space the strained relationship his NASA duties placed on his family life and his hectic ""retirement"" schedule of autograph signings and public appearances. Big emotional moments hinge on the death of Roger Chaffee Cernans close friend and onetime neighbor who perished in the Apollo 1 fire and on a letter Cernan sent to his daughter just before heading to the moon and carving her initials into a rock. But director Mark Craig never makes his interviews the films brick and mortar feel revelatory or vital. We sense there is reserve a professional prudence that keeps Cernan from say revealing anything about NASA that would threaten the organizations image. A segment on the Apollo crews social lives revels in the ""crazy"" times the families had without providing any examples. The special effects Craig employs for his space re-enactments are impressive for a non-IMAX documentary and theyre edited together with a lush poeticism. Yet in other sequences the editing is jumbled a scene of Cernan speaking at Neil Armstrongs 2012 funeral is abruptly inserted into the middle of the Apollo chronology. Manned spaceflight or the present days lack thereof has become a political topic Even as we send rovers further into the cosmos we are reluctant to put anyone but Matt Damon on Mars surface. The Last Man on the Moon wants to challenge that mindset by showing us whats possible when human gumption can work hand-in-hand with the national interest. But the films struggle to differentiate Cernan as a person rather than as the symbol he so clearly relishes being oversells the ""spaceflight"" part of the equation while shortchanging the ""manned.""

Photo NASA MOVIE REVIEW Last Man on the Moon Running time 95 minutes. Not rated (language). Eugene Cernan is a fine ambassador for space exploration especially in an age where our household-name astronauts are mostly fictional (Im looking at you Mark Watney). As the commander of Apollo 17 the last manned mission to the moon in 1972 Cernan is clearly still in awe of what America achieved during those cowboy years -- but he also speaks with the melancholy that results from several decades of hindsight about the havoc it wreaked on the personal lives of the astronauts. Director Mark Craig assembled a wealth of archival footage and home videos featuring Cernan originally a naval aviator during his years in the Apollo space program. He intercuts them with narration and reflection from the now 81-year-old retiree -- and a soaring ""Martian""-rivaling soundtrack from composer Lorne Balfe.

Five are now gone -- including Neil Armstrong the first to walk the moon. Still with us Buzz Aldrin (age 86) Alan Bean (83) David Scott (83) John W. Young (85) Charles Duke (80) Harrison Schmitt (81) and Chicago native Eugene Cernan who on Dec. 13 1972 left his footprints on the lunar surface and climbed the ladder of the lunar module of Apollo 17. He was the last man on the moon. In Mark Craigs beautiful and breathtaking and stirring documentary ""The Last Man on the Moon"" the 81-year-old Cernan comes across as an articulate thoughtful even philosophical man of pure courage warm humor strong emotions and more than a touch of vulnerability. Through extensive interviews with Cernan and other key players in the Apollo program archival footage visually impressive re-enactments and treasured home video footage and still photos ""The Last Man on the Moon"" is a memorable portrait of a genuine American Space Cowboy. Paul Newman could have played Cernan in a biopic. As sharp as ever and a born storyteller Cernan recounts his multiple and dangerous missions from the Gemini 9 spacewalk to the Apollo 10 flight (essentially a dress rehearsal for the moon landing as Cernan Young and Thomas Stafford did everything Apollo 11 would do just short of an actual landing). We also learn of Cernans early days as something of a daredevil pilot with the Navy. Over a nighttime backyard barbecue Cernans old Navy buddy former Naval Aviator Fred ""Baldy"" Baldwin ribs Cernan about having average bombing skills at best. Cernan takes a beat points up to the moon and says ""Thats 240000 miles away and I hit that."" At times Cernans recollections are bittersweet. Returning to the forgotten remnants of past launch sites he says ""I almost wish I didnt come here."" As Alan Bean acknowledges those dashing ""Right Stuff"" astronauts of the 1950s-1970s ""were not very good husbands [and not] very good fathers either."" Cernans first marriage did not survive his tenure as an astronaut. ""If you think going to the moon is hard you ought to try staying at home"" says his ex-wife Barbara Jean Atchley. When Cernan returned home from the Apollo 10 mission he told his daughter Tracy then 9 all about his grand adventures in space. When he was finished she said ""Now that youve gone to the moon Daddy can you take me camping?"" Some 40 years later Cernan sits on a swinging bench on his ranch with his grown daughter and talks about all those times he wasnt around to take her camping. ""It was a very selfish life"" he says. ""I was gone and gone and gone and gone and gone ..."" Cernan famously drew his daughters initials in the lunar dust just before leaving the moon. Its the best and coolest graffiti of all time. He also spoke with poetic grace just before his walk on the moon would come to an end saying in part ""As I take mans last step from the surface back home for some time to come ... Id like to say ... Americas challenge of today has forged mans destiny of tomorrow. And as we leave the Moon ... we leave as we came and God willing as we shall return with peace and hope for all mankind."" This is a great documentary about a great man.  Gravitas Ventures presents a documentary directed by Mark Craig. Running time 95 minutes. No MPAA rating.

Comments The Last Man on the Moon 95 minutes  2014 As commander of the Apollo 17 mission in 1972 astronaut Eugene Cernan became the last person to walk on the moons surface (he wrote his daughters initials in the dirt before reboarding the lunar module). That may not be enough of a distinction to justify a documentary but Cernan did participate in three space missions altogether and his recollections of them nicely re-created with archival footage and sound effects make for an interesting memoir (2014). Director Mark Craig struggles to construct a terrestrial portrait of Cernan now a Houston retiree in his 80s and one senses a man powerless against the gravitational pull of his career. Interviews with his family members confirm that like many former astronauts he regards himself as an angel among men; at the same time he seems trapped in his own past still second-guessing his performance during the troubled Gemini 9A mission in 1966.

Its a sobering of reminder of how that time has passed.A new documentary tells the story of astronaut Eugene Cernan the last man to set foot on the surface of the moon.(Photo Gravitas Ventures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4 stars out of 5Its never explicitly stated but Cernan seems to have been kind of a wild man perfect for the jobThe film is unexpectedly moving a reminder of what we are capable of and what weve left behind""The Last Man on the Moon"" is one of those movies we didnt realize we needed but turns out to be just the thing for our fractured cynical times.What happened to us? Thats not a question director Mark Craigs documentary asks explicitly. It doesnt have to. When reminded of the herculean achievement of sending men into space landing them on the moon and having them walk around for a few days the obvious lack of a shared mission is overwhelming and not a little sad.Thus the film in part about Apollo astronaut Eugene Cernan who is indeed the subject of the title is unexpectedly moving both as a reminder of what we once accomplished and of what we no longer seem capable of.The film begins with Cernan now 81 watching a rodeo in Texas. He looks like any other cowboy sitting in the stands. But look up at the moon. What do you think of when you see it? Without question Cernans thoughts and memories are different than those of all but a handful of people the lucky few who walked its surface when we were still reaching for the stars.From there Craig and Cernan walk us through what led to the astronauts mission. Old friends and colleagues (and his ex-wife) make it clear that Cernan was a good-time guy a talented pilot and a bit of a wild man. (Some of the old Kodachrome snapshots from when the astronauts let their hair down so to speak as most had crew cuts would fit right in with any of the latest selfies.)But make no mistake. These men were brilliant and they were brave. The point is driven home when we see for instance footage of the wreckage of the plane that killed Charlie Bassett and Elliott See the Gemini 9 crew for which Cernan and his partner served as backup. So Cernan flew the mission -- one fraught with problems as was Apollo 10 Cernans next mission. But the problems they solved on the fly as it were paved the way for the success of Apollo 11s moon landing when Cernans close friend Neil Armstrong made his one small leap for man one giant leap for mankind.Then there is Martha Chaffee who lived down the street from the Cernans. She recalls the terrible day of Jan. 27 1967 when astronaut Michael Collins arrived at her door. A fire on the launch pad had killed her husband Roger and two other Apollo astronauts. She can still barely choke out the words ""I knew I knew I knew right away. I said I know Mike but youve got to tell me. And he did.""Imagine it. You arrive at the pinnacle of your profession -- but you arrive with the knowledge that you could be killed at any moment because you are doing things man has never done. Cernans devil-may-care attitude toward life seemed to suit him well for this type of work as it did his colleagues.AZCENTRALThe Last Man on the Moon (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsBut it took its toll in other ways as well. Cernan notes that about 60 percent of the astronauts wound up divorced (him included). He and others explain To get a prime mission work came first above all else. Nothing could interfere. And for so many nothing did. ""I ignored my family"" he says. ""We all did.""Among the fascinating footage Craig pulls together is some of Cernans ex-wife watching the Apollo 17 mission the last moon landing. And yet she notes the difficulties of being Earth-bound. You think its hard going to the moon she asks? Try being left at home.But Cernan did reach the moon and walked on its surface the last of 12 men to do so. Will there be others? Will anyone again see Cernans daughters initials which he carved into the lunar surface with his boot before he left and which thanks to the lack of wind and atmosphere will forever remain undisturbed?AZCENTRALGoodys 2016 Oscars picks Who will win who deserves to winCraig seems to doubt it. Cernan parked the lunar rover in such a way that it could film the lunar modules blastoff from the moons surface. The footage is stunning -- real-life science fiction if youll excuse the oxymoron. Amazing stuff (the right stuff Tom Wolfe would say). Craig juxtaposes this with empty seats at NASA where the flight crew once sat.Cernan visits abandoned launch sites weeds growing all around with little happiness. ""I dont want to remember it this way"" he says. ""Its disappointing. I almost wish I hadnt come today.""And yet his memories serve as potential inspiration. Were grounded now but will we always be?""Dont ever count yourself out"" Cernan says reciting what he tells groups during speeches. ""Youll never know how good you are unless you try. Dream the impossible and go out and make it happen. I walked on the moon. What cant you do?""What indeed?Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebookfacebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

(Mark Craig/Garitas Ventures) In ""The Last Man on the Moon"" director Mark Craig uses archival footage and recent interviews to delve into the life of Gene Cernan a lively octogenarian who was an astronaut during the Apollo program. His 1972 moon landing was NASAs final manned mission to the lunar surface. Now 81 Cernan has hardly slowed down since then. He proves to be an entertaining narrator of his life story which he also recounted in a memoir of the same name. Cernan was always a risk-taker starting his career as a Navy pilot. When NASA came calling in search of potential astronauts he was one of 14 pilots to make the cut. He participated in a number of space missions during his career including the Apollo 10 trip which orbited the moon and he became famous for his work. But he also lost a number of friends along the way including the Apollo 1 crew all of whom died in a cabin fire during a launch rehearsal. One of the movies most touching scenes comes during an interview with Martha Chaffee the widow of one of those killed Roger Chaffee. Gene Cernan on the moon during Apollo 17. (Jack Schmit/NASA/Gravitas Ventures) Cernans final trip to space was the Apollo 17 moon mission. Before returning to Earth he wrote his daughters initials in the lunar dust. Thats noteworthy because Cernan admits on multiple occasions that he was a bad husband and father. Not only is the life of an astronaut dangerous -- ""risk is the price of progress"" one interviewee says -- but it doesnt leave much time for family especially in the early days of the space program. That being said there are some amusing detours as when Cernan his ex-wife and their friends talk about the ragers they used to throw. (There are Polaroids to prove it.) Such light moments leaven the mood of nostalgia. Cernan is proud of what he accomplished calling himself the luckiest man in the world for all that he got to see. But he also expresses regret at having done it at the expense of his family. Unrated. At the Angelika Pop-Up at Union Market. Contains brief strong language. 95 minutes. On Friday the theater will host a Qamp;A with former astronaut Pam Melroy after the 730 p.m. screening.

TWITTER This upbeat British documentary retraces the dramatic life story of Apollo astronaut Gene Cernan with warmth depth and superb visual effects. Take a pinch of Top Gun stir in a generous dollop of The Right Stuff add a light sprinkling of Mad Men and you have the formula for this uplifting documentary portrait of former Apollo astronaut Eugene Cernan. A real-life space cowboy in the Clint Eastwood mold Cernans epic story is a gift to any filmmaker. Still a tireless public speaker at the age of 80 his NASA career was full of fateful twists and daredevil drama most of it helpfully documented in high-quality archive footage. Premiered at Sheffield Doc/Fest in the U.K. this week The Last Man on the Moon is an effortlessly enjoyable true story grounded in the technocratic post-war optimism of the JFK era. Inspirational and warm-hearted without straying into Hollywood kitsch it will be a solid candidate for further festival bookings. Though the subject is perhaps more likely to interest TV buyers the grand historical canvas and superlative visual effects feel very well suited to a big screen. A living embodiment of the American Dream Cernan rose from a blue-collar immigrant family to become a much-decorated U.S. Navy pilot and record-breaking astronaut. Recruited by NASA in 1966 despite his lack of qualifications he logged almost 600 hours in space over the next decade 73 of them on the moon. He is the only man to have descended to the lunar surface twice the first as a test run for Neil Armstrongs crew. He also took one of the first space walks and set the speed record for a manned vehicle hitting 24791 miles per hour during Apollo 10s fiery re-entry into Earths atmosphere. British director Mark Craig is just the latest filmmaker to recognize the dramatic potential of Americas space program and its clean-cut heroes. The Last Man on the Moon strikes a familiar narrative tone celebratory and uncritical with disappointingly little of the Cold War context behind the space race. But it benefits from taking a lifelong view of its subject with more domestic and emotional detail than previous astronaut movies. Looking back over eight remarkable decades Cernans once-prodigious ego is now tempered with grandfatherly hindsight and humility. He ruefully reflects how NASA duties came with a heavy price claiming the lives of numerous comrades. He also confesses to becoming too selfishly absorbed in his globetrotting spaceman fame wrecking his first marriage and leading him to miss much of his eldest daughter Teresas early childhood. Then again he did carve her initials on the lunar surface which must earn him some serious Cool Dad points. Teresa appears in the film as do both wives. There is no rancor here. Houston we dont have a serious problem. Craig previously directed documentary portraits of Grand Prix race car drivers and there are clear parallels between these two high-risk careers where great courage meets cutting-edge technology. Indeed the production company behind The Last Man on the Moon belongs to Mark Stewart son of the Scottish Formula 1 legend Jackie Stewart. Both father and son have executive producer credits here. The director began his career working in graphics for British television which helps explain the films strong visual look. Opening with zippy animated credits that recall the legendary Saul Bass The Last Man on the Moon includes spectacular CG sequences that recreate Cernans space missions in Gravity-style widescreen dimensions. Visual effects supervisor Penny Holton and sound designer Nick Adams both do great work here. Lorne Balfes stirring score also adds to the sense that we are witnessing the last will and testament of an old-school hero from a more innocent age.

The old footage is uniformly arresting whether its showing us the kabooming beauty of liftoff or the astronauts wives smiling beneath their fetching bouffants. There are some rueful confessions -- ""We were not very good husbands. We werent very good fathers either"" says Alan Bean -- and choked-up bursts of feeling as when Cernan reads aloud the letter he wrote to his daughter just before Apollo 10 the test-flight moonshot in which Cernan and co. did everything Neil Armstrong would later except land. Film Details The Last Man on the Moon RatingNR GenreDocumentary Running Time99 min. More Info Trailer EXPAND But then the film vaults into orbit itself with its extended treatment of Cernans own time on the lunar surface during the last Apollo mission in 1973. He speaks at affecting length about watching the Earth rise about the silence and loneliness about cruising in that buggy rover. We see all this and because hes a born talker -- and because director Craig is careful and patient -- we feel it all too. The Last Man on the Moon puts you there and then asks why in the world we havent gone back. ""I almost wish I didnt come here today"" Cernan says in recent footage as he walks through whats left of NASAs old launch sites.

"The Last Man on the Moon review last and also luckiest | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Last Man on the Moon review last and also luckiestFormer NASA astronaut Eugene Cernan may have indeed been the final man on the lunar surface as the doc The Last Man on the Moon shows but he considers himself ""the luckiest human being in the world.""By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 27 2015The Last Man on the MoonDocumentary about Apollo astronaut Eugene Cernan. Directed by Mark Craig. Doc Soup screening at Bloor Hot Docs Cinema April 1-2. 99 minutes. STCNeil Armstrong. Edmund Hillary. Charles Lindbergh.Most people recognize these names for their respective ""first man"" achievements walking on the moon standing atop Mt. Everest (along with Tenzing Norgay) flying solo across the Atlantic Ocean.Article Continued BelowAnd in a culture obsessed with being first that is usually enough. So Apollo 17 astronaut Eugene Cernan who in 1972 became the final man to stride the lunar surface might seem more of a game-winning Jeopardy answer than a subject worthy of serious contemplation.Eugene ""Gene"" Cernan stood on the moon in 1972 the last person ever to make the journey.  (NASA)  The Last Man on the Moon a documentary by British filmmaker Mark Craig makes an impassioned case for taking the longer view of human achievement.In telling the story of Cernan at 81 still a vigorous storyteller and advocate for manned space flight it also explores the deeper question of why we stopped going to the moon. Why did America spend billions of dollars on the Apollo program captivating the world as 12 men walked and drove upon the dusty frontier only to cease manned space travel to places beyond Earths orbit?Money and politics are the obvious answers although intangible factors such as a collective loss of imagination and a ""been there done that"" malaise also came into play. The film shows the high cost paid by the Apollo astronauts for their risky adventures which an earlier film In the Shadow of the Moon also touched upon. Three astronauts died in the launch-pad fire of Apollo 1. Three others barely escaped alive in the Apollo 13 mid-flight disaster.Cernan one of the most travelled and also most garrulous of astronauts courted catastrophe in mishaps during his Gemini 9 spacewalk and Apollo 10 lunar rendezvous. Both missions were essential preludes to the successful 1969 first moon landing by the late Neil Armstrong (close pal Cernan delivered his 2012 eulogy) and Buzz Aldrin. Many Apollo astronauts returned to Earth to find their marriages disintegrating as work took them away from family life. This also happened to Cernan whose ex-wife sums it up this way ""If you think going to the moon is hard you ought to try staying home.""The Last Man on the Moon alternates between archival footage and current interviews the latter tinged with nostalgia and regret. But Craig avoids either lionizing or reducing his subject. His camera often tilts up encouraging us to look beyond the limits of Earth.And Cernan isnt one for self-aggrandizement or self-pity. He may have been the last man on the moon but he considers himself to be ""the luckiest human being in the world.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.
