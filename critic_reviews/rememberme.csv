By Peter Rainer Film critic March 12 2010 Save for later Saved Robert Pattinson left Emilie de Ravincenter and Pierce Brosnan are shown in a scene from Remember Me. Myles Aronowitz/Summit Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If hes not playing a vampire will Robert Pattinsons fanatic followers be equally gaga for him? This is the momentous question posed by ""Remember Me"" where he plays Tyler a rebellious New York University student and rich scion deliberately living the low-rent lifestyle. The short answer to this question is I believe ""Indubitably."" As teen or tween idols go Pattinson is unusual in that he is actually a good actor; it would be a pity if he was embraced only for his jaw line and bloodsucking acumen and not for the dramatic skills that are intermittently on view here. Overwritten and overcooked ""Remember Me"" still manages a few explosive sequences between Pattinson and Pierce Brosnan playing his CEO father. (Brosnans Brooklyn accent is a sometime thing.) But Pattinson is best in this movie when hes not shouting and throwing things as in some lovely quiet moments between Tyler and his precocious 11-year-old sister (Ruby Jerins) - theres a J.D. Salinger quality to these scenes - and also in the intimate sequences with his star-crossed girlfriend (Emilie de Ravin). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Still and all ""Remember Me"" is not altogether worth remembering. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for violence sexual content language and smoking.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test?

This may suggest an effort on his part to add thespian respect and some rebellious street-cred to his image. If so he might have chosen a more subtle director than Allen Coulter (Hollywoodland TVs Nurse Jackie The Sopranos etc) and a better script than this cliched strangely humourless effort by newcomer Will Fetters.Nevertheless the all-important romantic mechanics work well enough. The movies meet-cute occurs at the NYU canteen where conflicted rich kid Tyler (Pattinson) dare-dates overprotected lone-parented Ally (petite star Emilie de Ravin from Lost) on the prompting of Tylers standard-issue flatmate and gooseberry Aidan (Tate Ellington). Fate family loss father obsession and too much booze have brought them together Allys cop dad (Chris Cooper wasted) had previously banged up Tyler for a back-street brawl which explains the cool-looking bruises the nice but nihilistic 21 year old sports throughout the movie - as well as the angry dads embargo and the curtailment of their brief idyll as the calendar turns fatefully towards September...Its a movie that craves much indulgence Pattinson playing handsome mixed-up and misunderstood is watchable enough but he aint no Olivier; while de Ravin bears her straitjacket role of pretty sweet and wise with good grace. But be warned if youre vulnerable to outrageous cringe-inducing implausibilities - not least the ludicrous stand-up row between Tyler and his father in the latters Twin Towers boardroom - youd best give this one a miss.

In fact I was quite amazed by it and could not really say why as it was a combination of actors story and direction which pulled off an unexpectedly good film. I dont know whether the 9/11 ending was the best option but sadly a cross section of people were involved.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 28 2010BCFeaturedLong and turgid. Good acting from Pattison could not save this miserable tale. Even when I thought I was getting involved some preposterous scenes (classroom and boardroom) served to remind me that this was aimed squarely at teen mentality.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 26 2010EmmaFeaturedso my evaluation is that I loved the movie I thought for the story they were trying to tell it was a bit long and drawn out the driving plot in the movie was wanting though the heart warming moments kept it afloat it was a sweet showing of a relationship being built rather than the typical love at first sights of the romantic comedies. As for the acting Emilie de Ravin does not get enough credit for this movie she was touching and sweet and tried her damn est to make her ""Mary-Sue"" character have depth but there is only so much a girl can do with a script I am as of yet undecided about Robert Patterson  At times he impressed me at other times all I could think was BROODY BROODY BROODY perhaps he should move away from tortured souls for a while and give the happy side of his acting muscles a stretch. I think the boy has potential and it would be a shame for him to disappear with Twilight Hype. The true underdog of the movie of course is Ruby Jerins who is hardly ever commented on. Stunning performance by one so young and gave a heart wrenching performance as the bullied little sister. What upsets most people of course is the ending I was very young when it happened and was safe thousands of miles away so I gave the emotional response the director was looking for However for someone who is old enough to not just remember but to comprehend what was happening I can see how this must have been a complete insult and smack in the face the subject matter could have been dealt with with a little more tact - dropping hints along the way what was to come I think would have given it the Titanic effect it was going for and if it was shock that they wanted then a car crash would have sufficed and the same message would have been revised with out offended the memory of hundreds of people. Overall I think it was an inexperienced script that killed the movie while there were many interesting heartfelt moments the story was inconsistent and dropped in many places.

amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Remember Me amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Alice in Wonderland Green Zone >> Remember Me Ally (Emilie de Ravin) and Tyler (Robert Pattinson) meet in the spring and split in the fall. We know they cant last--the film opens with an ode to the temporary people who permanently affect your life--but also because theirs is the wrenching all-encompassing young love that always throws itself off the rails. Set in the early aughts Remember Me is a simple romance for swooners but screenwriter Will Fetters wins points for noting that two lovers bring with them a clashing mess of family and friends who interfere in major strokes (a la Romeo and Juliet) but also in the subtle common inheritances in how we connect fight and protect ourselves. De Ravin and Pattinsons deepest point of connection is that shes lost a mom and he a brother. But on the surface theyre just two incredibly good-looking kids shocked at their good fortune. As always its fun to watch Pattinsons goofy efforts to disguise his teen idol appeal with awkward gestures and proto-crazy man mumbles especially when even the screenplay isnt fooled--roommate Tate Ellington wants to run a business selling toothbrushes to the one-night ladies who wake up in his bed. Chris Cooper and Pierce Brosnan have strong turns playing the couples very different dads both lions who love control. (Brosnan one hopes is starting to make use of the vacuum Alec Baldwin left when he went comedy.) Lena Olin doesnt get much of a chance to register as Pattinsons posh mom--the big reveal is de Ravin a young talent with a tomboy charm and great inner strength. But the nicest angle is how much time director Allen Coulter (a TV-man making his film debut) devotes to Pattinsons love for elementary school sister Ruby Jerins an awkward artistic girl who suspects (rightly) that her Manhattan prep school classmates think shes a freak. The Twilight hunk still doesnt seem at ease helming a big romance but his scenes with Jerins have a sweet credible confidence--ladyfriends aside this is one girl hell fight for at all cost.

Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 12 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Remember Me Directed by Allen Coulter Written by Will Fetters Starring Robert Pattinson Emilie de Ravin Chris Cooper Lena Olin Tate Ellington Ruby Jerins and Pierce Brosnan Classification 14A The gloomy romantic drama Remember Me starring and produced by Robert Pattinson of Twilight fame tries earnestly to stir us with its story of young love in New York in the summer of 2001. But director Allen Coulter ( Hollywoodland) never convincingly ignites the romance - a truly obnoxious roommate character doesnt help - and the film gets bogged down by plot points that plod toward an event of devastating proportions. Tyler (Pattinson in top brooding form) is a grimy chain-smoking bookstore clerk. This mixed-up pretty boy audits college classes having at least temporarily spurned the silver spoon held at arms length by his Wall Street lawyer father (Pierce Brosnan in a fine chilly performance). Hes about to turn 22 the age his older brother was when he hanged himself just after starting a job at their fathers firm. This makes Tyler do a lot of smoking notebook scribbling and staring out of windows in profile thinking deep thoughts. His bordering-on-lethargic demeanour - which lasts throughout the story - hits the flipside only when hes ticked off and then he rants or gets physical. We get our first taste when roommate Aidan (Tate Ellington) drags Tyler out for a night on the town and Tyler lays into some guys who are hassling a couple of musicians (Tylers brother was a musician see?). The investigating cop (Chris Cooper) doesnt like Tylers righteous temper so roughs him up and throws him in jail for the night. Turns out the cops daughter Ally (Aussie Emilie de Ravin from TVs Lost) is in one of Tylers classes. Aidan goads him into asking her out suggesting that he romance her then ditch her as a way of getting back at the cop. This is one of the lamest suggestions youll ever hear in a movie. Of course it relates to a later conflict but that conflict could have worked just as well without it. At the beginning of the film we learn that Ally witnessed the fatal shooting of her mother when she was a kid. We are meant to believe that the shared experience of personal loss is the root of the couples connection and that their blossoming romance provides escape healing inspiration. But that vibe isnt achieved. In fact the romantic story feels kind of stretched out. More lively are the father-issue subplots at play here. Allys new relationship triggers a fight with her father who strikes her. She moves out. Tylers father is icily uninterested in his awkward 11-year-old daughter Caroline a prodigy artist. Need I mention that Tyler loathes his dad? Tylers most attractive trait is his devotion to his sister who endures a series of humiliations. Tyler lashes out when his father skips Carolines art show but saves his most ape-like behaviour for the classmate who pranks her. Not cool. Remember Me could have been a decent family drama especially considering its setting but that was not to be. Too bad because the romance is highly forgettable.

Emilie de Ravin and Robert Pattinson star in ""Remember Me."" Photo NICOLE RIVELLI SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT | ASSOCIATED PRESS Remember Me 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Team Edward consider yourselves warned. Not that theTwilight movies are all daisies and buttercups (like please) but Robert Pattinsons latest effort is an exercise in world-class gloom. Although it is not strictly speaking the most depressing movie ever made it should be approached with caution by anyone who owns and wears in public a T-shirt adorned with Pattinsons face. I saw one such lass exiting the screening I attended poor thing. She looked shell-shocked. Remember Meis not a bad film. Im going to stick my neck out here and call it a good one -- a small dense chamber study of unhappy people looking for hope in the darkness often literally. In a shift from their sun-baked work onHollywoodland director Allen Coulter and cinematographer Jonathan Freeman shoot most everything in a dim urban light sometimes natural sometimes fluorescent a move that slurries color and flattens contours while it highlights the grit and grot of New York City. The effect can be suffocating but as I said gloom. Thats the order of the day from a brutal subway killing in the opening sequence to a montage of abruptly rearranged lives at the end. In between there are bouts of loving and laughter as Ally (Emilie de Ravin) and Tyler (Pattinson) meet and flirt and maybe fall in love but these are deeply wounded characters tip-toeing through minefields of issues. Ally watched her mother die in front of her. Tylers brother killed himself. His little sister (Ruby Jerins) is traumatized his father (Pierce Brosnan) is a lordly corporate turd and as for himself hes got a nihilistic violent streak a mile wide. So does Allys dad (Chris Cooper) a cop who arrests Tyler after a street brawl in an early scene. Tylers cheerfully caustic roommate (Tate Ellington) suggests wooing Ally as retribution a scummy idea that Tyler embraces as a lark. At first. But nothing in Remember Me is much of a lark for long. On the upside Pattinson smiles. Yes We get to see his teeth He still has that annoying hair-gel infestation and he still chaws on his lines in a faux-American mumble but its clear hes waging a valiant fight against It Boy typecasting. He even gets a few funny lines. Will Fetters talky script includes a fair portion of quirked-out humor -- most of it delivered by Ellington some by de Ravin and Pattinson in their courtships quippier moments. I close somewhat cryptically with an appeal to do the math. The films painful climax comes out of nowhere -- forcefully and efficiently like a hard punch to the kidneys from a very large man -- unless you apply a simple mathematical equation to a significant detail revealed in the movies first five minutes. I saw the end coming and girded myself for it but even so it hurt. With or without the T-shirt. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Apple Smartwatches at Best Buy 50 off from 249 + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The problems with ""Remember Me starring Robert Pattinson -- the vampire Edward Cullen of ""Twilight"" -- arent the heartthrobs fault. Even if they were its hard to imagine the ""Gossip Girl"" or ""Twilight"" demographic this PG-13 romantic drama seems tailored for necessarily caring. No the missteps in this story of two lovers from different classes drawn together by grief are due to ambitions not quite met. First-time screenwriter Will Fetters wanted to mix the personal and the historical. Director Allen Coulter and his cast which includes heavy hitters Pierce Brosnan Chris Cooper and Lena Olin want to give new audiences an affair to remember in part by setting it in an unforgettable year -- 2001. Ghosts haunt the characters but more consequential spirits hang over the movie. Melancholy and suppressed fury permeate the story. On a subway platform an 11-year-old girl watches as her mother is shot. Ten years later Ally (Emilie de Ravin) sits in a global politics course at New York University. Also in the class is Tyler Hawkins (Pattinson). Ally lives in Queens with her father a New York City police detective played by Cooper. A mopey chain-smoking slacker Tyler rooms with Aidan (Tate Ellington) a mildly randy chatterbox. Tyler carries a tattered copy of Keats in his back pocket stocks shelves at the famous Strand used-book store. He also keeps a notebook that is an extended conversation with his older brother Michael who committed suicide. Did we mention Tyler is a trust- fund scion who turned his back on Dads money? While that may force him to ride a bike and live in a tenement with a faulty deadbolt it doesnt stop him from giving into the mood swings and jabs of an entitled kid. Though Tyler and Ally share a class -- no not socioeconomic class -- they dont meet cute. They meet intentionally icky. We wont give it away but it has to do with Allys father and a some ill-conceived payback. The plan goes rather too well and Tyler falls opening his heart to tough and tender working-class survivor Ally. If it sounds a little pat too often it is although de Ravin carries a nice early moment playing a girl whos not a sucker for a line offered by a curiously handsome guy. They are two wounded birds flapping toward each other and Pattinson and de Ravin make a sweet enough pair of cooing coupling doves. Through much of the budding love story ""Remember Me"" withholds the facts of Michaels suicide the how the why and maybe most important the length of time Tyler sister Caroline and divorced parents Diane (Lena Olin) and Charles have been in mourning. Brosnan portrays chilly Wall Street exec Charles. Hes a man still playing his master-of-the-universe Wall Street role even though he has been rebuked by loss. Wee charmer Ruby Jerins (of ""Nurse Jackie"") plays Tylers beloved sister Caroline whos getting emotional short shrift from Charles. Shes also being bullied at school. With five Emmy nominations Coulter has had great success with class acts ""Sex and the Cit y"" ""Damages"" ""The Sopranos."" His first feature ""Hollywoodland"" while studious had a lot going for it. No one will mistake ""Remember Me"" for television even quality TV. It strains. It tries too hard -- from freighted pacing to steely cinematography -- to be cinematic. Although the story starts with a leap from 1991 to 10 years later and is set in New York City ""Remember Me"" seems to play coy with its setup. So a date written on a school chalkboard might come as the big surprise for those who havent followed the march of seasons. Coulter seems to treat it as a big reveal. Or maybe its the last hint for the remedial among us. The finale manages to be tasteful and exploitative at the same time. It touts forgiveness while being mildly infuriating. Such is the danger of borrowing from the enormous to merely entertain. If that. Forgettable should be the last thing a movie touching on the events of 9/11 should be. Yet ""Remember Me"" is just that. ""REMEMBER ME."" PG-13 violence sexual content language and smoking. 1 hour 53 minutes.

Playing Tyler Hawkins -- a bohemian child of privilege consumed by Oedipal rage -- the ""Twilight"" hunk fills the screen with cigarette smoke stubble and hooded green eyes but little else. This StoryRemember Me Robert who? Oh forget it.Watch the trailerFind showtimes Ostensibly the movie is the story of an angry young man (Pattinson) and his emotionally bullying father (Pierce Brosnan). The plot is set in motion when our hero who hates all forms of oppression is arrested after trying to stop a street fight then mouthing off to the investigating cop (Chris Cooper). Enter the cops beautiful daughter Ally (Emilie de Ravin). Egged on by his wisecracking college roommate (Tate Ellington) Tyler starts dating Ally as a way to get back at her father but ends up falling in love with Ally without meaning to. And of course Ally finds out that Tyler was using her and breaks up with him. (Tyler and Ally by the way have dark secrets. We learn about hers -- as a little girl she watched her mom get shot -- in the movies opening sequence. Tylers mysterious back story -- told in a series of letters addressed to an unidentified ""Michael"" -- takes a little longer to come out.) But theres something else hidden inside this overripe tale. Some wont even notice it at first. For others the movie contains a plot twist so stunning yet so stunningly obvious that it functions like a kind of ticking time bomb in the corner of the screen. After the first hint of whats coming -- which crops up less than 10 minutes into the movie and then doesnt let up -- the foreshadowing becomes so distracting that by the time the darn thing goes off theres only a sense of relief.  1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains obscenity gun violence and fist-fighting sensuality smoking and other disturbing thematic material. 98 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Robert who?

Time for a quick game of One of These Things Is Not Like the Others Marlon Brando. James Dean. Robert Pattinson. In the wobbly ""Ordinary People"" retread ""Remember Me"" RPattz does stake his claim to be compared to a famous actor Hayden Christensen. OK he isnt that bad (who is?). But as a brooding NYU student haunted by the suicide of his older brother ""Twilight"" star Pattinson is ingratiating when hes supposed to be tormented vexed when hes supposed to be volcanic. PHOTOS ROBERT PATTINSON PATTINSON IN NYC A heavy smoker and drinker who is often rude and occasionally gets in fights (this set of characteristics used to be known as ""male"" but now apparently qualifies you for your own wing in the Bad Boy Hall of Fame) Pattinsons Tyler gets in a dust-up with a dirty cop (Chris Cooper) that leaves him with a scrape on his cheek. In a halfhearted revenge prank dreamed up by his goofy sidekick (Tate Ellington who makes you long for the relative genius of a young Steve Guttenberg) Tyler asks out a fellow student who is the cops daughter Ally (Emilie de Ravin -- picture Michelle Williams then divide the amount of talent by five) with a sketchy idea of being mean to her. Instead they genuinely warm to each other. Theyve got tragedy in common -- her mom was murdered in front of her. This event changed her on a deep emotional level Now she eats dessert first. You never know if youre going to get gunned down during the entree. ROBERT PATTINSON VAMPIRE SLAYER SPOILER ALERT ROBERT PATTINSONS NEW MOVIE ENDS HOW?? The movie thinks its setting the table for a tense scene when Ally inevitably discovers why Tyler first approached her. But since they really do like each other his original intention to embarrass her doesnt much matter. Meanwhile the script trots out dueling cliches such as the precocious little sister and the heartless dad (Pierce Brosnan doing a hilarious Brooklyn accent). Daddy is a corporate titan who was such a bore to work for that hes the main reason his older son killed himself. Tylers sidekick flaps around in the background trying very hard to be funny and telling his buddy and the audience all about how broody and torment-y Tyler is but its the audience that gets tormented by Tylers would-be banter -- lines like ""Anonymous. Is that Greek?"" and ""Mon dieu sacre bleu French toast"" Also just to make it clear he liked his dead brother? Hes got the guys name tattooed over his heart. The dullness of this writing (script by Will Fetters) is more than matched by the dull look achieved by director Allen Coulter who appears to have shot the film through a piece of yard-sale Tupperware. Coulter pompously thinks hes going to floor us in the final moments but no one who has been paying attention will be surprised. For all Coulters pretensions to cosmic profundity the ending is just a meaningless coincidence and a cheap gimmick. ""Remember Me"" wants to make us think of Holden Caulfield but its far closer to Nicholas Sparks. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Hall of Famer Father Murphy Merlin Olsen dies Read Next Hall of Famer Father Murphy Merlin Olsen dies Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44530 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21108 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 17703 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Remember Me | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; remember-me ) Remember Me (United States 2010) March 11 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Spoiler Alert This movie contains spoilers about the time frame during which the movies ending transpires. One suspects Remember Me would earn the official Nicholas Sparks Seal of Approval if there was such a thing. This movie is the kind of overwrought half-baked romantic drama that has become Sparks stock-and-trade. So for those who arent concerned about an estrogen overdose and for whom two ""legitimate"" Sparks adaptations are not enough (the recent Dear John and the upcoming The Last Song) Remember Me effectively fills the gap. Theres more contrived melodrama in these two hours than romance fans could reasonably hope for. Remember Me represents Robert Pattinsons attempt to prove he can do more than sparkle like a faux vampire but the case he presents is not convincing. He spends most of the movie trying to channel James Dean. Dean may have been overrated but he had talent charisma and swagger. Pattison seems to lack the first two qualities and he may be faking the third. (Although that in and of itself would be a form of acting.) He spends most of this movie brooding which allows him to work on his scowl. To be fair some of Pattinsons low-key scenes with his female co-star Losts Emilie de Ravin (who is delightful) are nicely done but the actor fails to impress when sharing the screen with the likes of Chris Cooper and Pierce Brosnan. The word ""lightweight"" seems entirely appropriate as a description of this leading man. Remember Me opens with a short prologue set in 1991 that shows the train platform murder of the mother of 11-year old Ally Craig (played as an adult by de Ravin). Flash-forward 10 years to New York City during the spring of 2001. Rootless Tyler Hawkins (Pattinson) days short of his 22nd birthday is thinking dark thoughts about his older brother Michael who committed suicide six years ago. To cheer up his roommate Tylers buddy Aidan (Tate Ellington) prescribes girls and drinks. Things dont turn out well. Tyler becomes embroiled in an altercation and expresses displeasure with the attitude of the head cop at the scene Sgt. Neil Craig (Chris Cooper). His pugnacious approach earns him a cut face and a night in the slammer. He is bailed out by a 450-per-hour lawyer put on the case by his estranged father Wall Street honcho Charles Hawkins (Pierce Brosnan). Aidan encourages Tyler to seek revenge on the police officer and what better way to do it than by dating his daughter Allie who happens to be in Tylers global politics class? Tyler contrives a meeting and the two hit it off. After a few dates and a fight between Allie and Neil she moves in with Tyler and Aidan. Thats when she learns that he has a sad and complicated life - he despises his father pities his mother (Lena Olin) and genuinely loves only his younger sister Caroline (Ruby Jerins). The more Tyler opens up to her the more she reveals to him about the tragedy in her past. The ghost of 9/11 hovers over this entire motion picture making the date of its ending inevitable although the moment when this happens feels like a sucker punch. Remember Mes first shot features a nighttime image of the Twin Towers circa 1991. Later in Tylers political science class theres a seemingly throw-away discussion about terrorists motivations. The film allows events to move inexorably forward so were aware of the clock ticking down June July August September. Despite all the foreshadowing the way the event is presented reeks of exploitation. The ending might appeal to a die-hard nihilist but I suspect the core members of the target demographic are going to be shocked and angered. The romantic elements of Remember Me are the strongest components. There is a degree of chemistry between Pattinson and de Ravin (ironically more than there is between him and his Bella Kristen Stewart) so some of their more simple scenes work especially if divorced from the heavy-handed plot and seen as stand-alone encounters. Unfortunately the romance is built on a foundation of contrivances so absurd that its impossible to ignore how forced and artificial the plots development is. There are also some odd moments of discontinuity that may be explained by a discrepancy between the published running length (128 minutes) and the actual one (112 minutes). It would not surprise me to learn that 15 minutes were edited out of the theatrical release. The pacing is still slow but it would explain some of the gaps and mood swings. Remember Me appears to have been designed as a chance for Pattison to ape James Dean while drawing on the popularity of his Twilight character as a means to sell the movie. As a pure romance this is mediocre at best. As a drama its no better. The synthesis of these elements into a stew of less than appealing consistency Remember Me is forgettable.

Remember Me Robert Pattinson broods again | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRemember Me Robert Pattinson broods againIf Remember Me is remembered for anything at all other than being yet another Robert Pattinson vehicle it will be for its over-the-top ending which ranks high amongst the most shameless jerkers of tears ever unleashed upon lachrymose teens.Twilight heartthrob Robert Pattinson is paired with Emilie de Ravin in a shameless attempt to cash in while hes at his James Dean-like best.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 12 2010 Starring Robert Pattinson Emilie de Ravin Pierce Brosnan Chris Cooper and Lena Olin. 109 minutes. Directed by Allen Coulter. At major theatres.14A If Remember Me is remembered for anything at all other than being yet another Robert Pattinson vehicle it will be for its over-the-top ending which ranks high amongst the most shameless jerkers of tears ever unleashed upon lachrymose teens.Article Continued BelowThe fact that it likely will succeed in causing flash pubescent floods in theatres should not be taken as proof of the pictures general excellence. The reverse is true Any movie that requires something this maudlin and exploitive to unblock the tear ducts prior to rolling the credits has failed in the intervening two hours or so to do anything worthy of emotion.Its becoming increasingly apparent that the curse which afflicts Pattinson isnt the immortal vampire lust that his character Edward profitably summons in the Twilight franchise.No its the requirement made of him by every director that he brood all over the place. Pattinson isnt allowed to live a normal life like the rest of us. He is a more than capable actor yet he is doomed for all eternity to sit in a corner and brood about the girl/fish/life that got away. Even when he has good reason to brood - the suicide of his character Tylers older brother in Remember Me would certainly qualify - he seems excessively brood-y about it.The fact that Pattinson is a championship brooder doesnt change the picture. Im not the first nor will I be the last to compare him to James Dean in that furrow of his brow and that concentrated suck on the ciggie. The real problem is that hes stuck with scripts that revolve around the intensity of his brooding. I would venture to say that 99 per cent of the problems his various characters endure is the result of excessive brooding with the exception of that unfortunate vampire curse in Twilight - probably the result of another vampire having grown bored of his constant moping about.In Remember Me Pattinsons Tyler is brooding over having won the genetic lottery. He is a New York University student with a fabulously wealthy dad (Pierce Brosnan) a gorgeous mom (Lena Olin) and enough free cash that he can drink and smoke to abandon without causing the slightest ill effect to his rakishly slender body. Is he happy? Of course not.He is drawn towards fellow brooder Ally (Emilie de Ravin from TVs Lost) not because he instinctively knows she has a brood-worthy tragedy in her own past but because hes pushed into it on a bet by his loutish roommate Aidan (Tate Ellington).Earlier we saw what happens when Tyler foolishly takes his brooding off the leash. He gets involved in a fight with thugs in an alleyway. He bravely attempts to be the Good Samaritan but his actions are judged by the cops to be suspicious. Angered by their lack of mind-reading ability Tyler begins to pummel Sgt. Neil Craig (Chris Cooper) who - lawdy - will later turn out to be the dad of Ally. (Dont brood; this isnt a spoiler.)While attempting to brood his way into Allys heart Tyler will also have to brood his way out of dads doghouse - and dad bites. Tyler could try using sex to break the ice with Ally at least. But based on the evidence in Remember Me that only leads to more brooding.It is another curious fact about Pattinson that 99 per cent of the scrapes his characters get into (with the exception once again of that vampire thing) could be solved if he were just to pop open a beer or brew a pot of tea and just explain to the aggrieved other party what it is that hes brooding about.But then there wouldnt be much reason for a movie in the first place would there? Now thats really something worth brooding over.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday March 11 2010 431 PM Title Remember Me Hoping for a little emotional manipulation with your popcorn? Look no further.Director Allen Coulter and writer Will Fetters didnt want us to forget ""Remember Me"" so they sandpapered their standard script with an indie grit. They somehow snared ""Twilight"" hottie Robert Pattinson. And they set their mediocre romance on the eve of 9/11.That fateful day plays no other part in this unexceptional story which begins when NYU students Aidan (Tate Ellington) and Tyler (Pattinson) get arrested by an angry cop named Neil Craig (Chris Cooper). The next day they discover Craigs daughter Ally (Emilie de Ravin) is also at NYU and plot revenge.Tylers idea is to seduce Ally and then break her heart but after they discover a shared grief he falls in love instead.Naturally his original plan is revealed at the worst possible time so he has to comfort his bullied little sister (Ruby Jerins) and confront his uncaring father (Pierce Brosnan) while nursing a broken heart.Pattinson gets to show off a little more personality than hes allowed as the worlds broodiest vampire. But aside from the gifted young Jerins everyone else seems to be wandering around in search of a movie. Even the filmmakers appear to realize theres something lacking which is the only reasonable explanation for a supremely misguided ending that -- well lets just remember that the movie is set in late 2001.Theres no shame in exploring tragedy through art. But exploiting it to make your very ordinary movie feel more important? Thats another story.

"Movie review Remember Me - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Movie review Remember MeTwilights Robert Pattinson looks good in romantic mode but his latest film needs more heart than heartthrob.March 12 2010|By BETSY SHARKEY | Film Critic Theres only one thing that loves Robert Pattinson more than his legions of hysterical teenage fans and thats the camera. Which helps but doesnt quite save the earnest new romantic drama ""Remember Me"" whose filmmakers hang everything on those chiseled cheeks and moody eyes. Like Tyler the angst-ridden 21-year-old NYU student he plays scowling between class and the coffee shop where he pours all those conflicted feelings into a battered journal the ""Twilight"" star is still very much a work in progress. Pattinson has definitely figured out how to look the part wearing ""brooding"" like a James Dean leather jacket and director Allen Coulter truly does bet the bank on it with moments like this setting the tone Hes shirtless with perfectly constructed bed head the morning sun streaming over his shoulders as he makes shadow puppets on the naked back of his still sleeping girlfriend Ally (""Losts"" Emilie de Ravin). That lingering shot and dozens of equally adoring ones like it could fill a young Hollywood hunks calendar in no time. But this is a movie not a magazine spread and therein lies the rub. What the actor hasnt yet found is a way past those soulful eyes into the soul itself. If he does Pattinson could have the makings of a brilliant career something more than the hot streak hes got going as the ""it"" guy of the moment. The same problems plague the film which is beautifully shot but its emotional potential unrealized. The story itself is set in a not too distant NYC past with Tyler still reeling from the death of his brother some years ago. What begins as a revenge date with Ally in that big-city small-world minor-skirmish major-grudge way soon turns into something more. Allys another victim of tragedy and that mutual society of unprocessed pain becomes their central bond and the central plot device driving the movie. Both have family issues. Tyler is pulled between poles -- a remote father Pierce Brosnan as a New York attorney by way of Brooklyn or at least thats what the accent sounds like and an emotionally wounded artistic younger sister played by the delightful Ruby Jerins. Ally meanwhile has an over-protective father a cop ( Chris Cooper) whos having trouble with his daughter growing up. There is a lot of working through relationship and life issues undertaken in ""Remember Me"" and screenwriter Will Fetters in his first feature shows a nice facility with dialogue which helps offset some of the weaknesses in the plot. Fetters has a particularly good ear for those circling seductions of slacker twentysomethings as they waver between arrogance and uncertainty half-finished metaphors hanging like smoke in the air. Speaking of smoke Pattinson does a lot of it to the point that the dangling cigarette in the iconic way of Brando or Dean starts to feel a little forced. Thankfully Tylers bike is man-powered; had they gone with a Harley it would have pushed it all over the edge. This is the second feature for Coulter a prolific veteran of high-gloss high-profile TV drama of the ""Sopranos"" strain and is coming four years after a solid debut with the mystery noir ""Hollywoodland. "" The filmmaker has created a slightly aged New York that is filled with intellectual discourse conducted in used bookstores and art gallery openings. But somewhere the heart that must anchor a romantic drama has gone missing. We dont so much feel the relationships as see them. In this De Ravin and Pattinson are far better at teasing play than steaming up the screen. She has a lightness that is appealing though there is a regrettable shower fight that doesnt work in anyones favor. When the end does come in this overly long film it hits with such unexpected surprise and force it is sure to be debated. What some will see as a sucker punch I found more of a footnote for what ultimately matters in ""Remember Me"" is all that comes before. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview 6 Month Rule breaks them allJune 8 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewMovieEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-remember12-2010mar12,0,2296164.story",200,rememberme14,rememberme,latimes

Robert Pattinson and Emilie de Ravin cast off the ghosts of ""Twilight"" and ""Lost"" as New York City college students falling in love. They give it all theyve got and they are pretty darned charming. Their family conflicts are intelligently sketched in. Hes mad at his financier father for being too distant she worries that her cop dad is too smotheringly protective. Each is overcoming a family tragedy. The milieu is nicely detailed with convincing atmospheric locations in Queens Wall Street dumpy student digs and swank Hamptons vacation homes. The hip banter is well above average and the supporting cast (Pierce Brosnan Chris Cooper Lena Olin) is first-rate. The script has a playful way of tweaking cliched love-movie scenes. When a flirty kitchen episode becomes too movie-ish somebody gets jokingly drenched with a pot of cold spaghetti water and it really livens up the scene. But the project takes a fatal wrong turn by demanding that we wallow in a dramatic twist of fate. A seemingly inconsequential action at the climax becomes a profound life-changer giving each characters journey an unpredictable -- and I would argue contrived -- conclusion. Director Allen Coulter is apparently aiming to create the feeling that were watching individuals in real life rather than characters in a movie. The device that screenwriter Will Fetters uses to impose that unearned gravitas on the finale left me feeling like hed doused the audience with a pot of cold spaghetti water. And not in a nice way.

ABOUT THE MOVIERemember Me  1/2 (out of four)Stars Robert Pattinson Emilie de Ravin Chris Cooper Lena Olin Pierce Brosnan Tate EllingtonDirector Allen CoulterDistributor Summit EntertainmentRating PG-13 for violence sexual content language and smokingRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Twilight heartthrob Robert Pattinson seems to have found a better vehicle for his angst-ridden style of acting. Those who relish him as a lovesick bloodsucker will surely take issue but until Remember Me his best acting job was as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Pattinson was woefully miscast as Salvador Dali in last years Little Ashes but playing a contemporary brooding and lost young man in Remember Me shows that he has more range than is visible in his one-dimensional role as a sexy vampire. It may strike some Twilight fans as heresy but he strikes up more chemistry with Emilie de Ravin than he does with Twilight love interest and purported real-life girlfriend Kristen Stewart. Pattinson plays Tyler an New York University student with a turbulent relationship with his arrogant and emotionally distant father (Pierce Brosnan) a powerful attorney. Tyler has a convincingly sweet bond with his gifted 11-year-old sister Caroline (Ruby Jerins). He also has a convenient friendship with a hard-partying college roommate Aidan (Tate Ellington) who is the key source of the films rare lighthearted moments. Tyler meets fellow NYU student Ally (de Ravin) on a kind of dare and they quickly connect. Both are sensitive damaged souls beneath their cool exteriors and verbal banter. Both have suffered tragedies that shape the adults they are becoming. Allys police officer dad (Chris Cooper) is tightly coiled and overprotective. Ally loves him but also chafes at how he tries to control her. Remember Me is a touching love story but its broader tale of familial relations packs a greater emotional punch. Elements of the story come off as contrived with unlikely coincidences linking more realistic moments. It also has a rather morose tone and sluggish pacing leavened by the welcome humor of the precocious Caroline and the wastrel pose struck by Aidan. Pattinson serves as co-executive producer of the film which is most interesting as a study in loss grief and resolution. He seems to be doing his best James Dean which may be a cliched choice but overall its a gently bittersweet and affecting portrait.

"Remember Me Movie review Indie romance a smart choice for Twilight star Pattinson |       NJ.com comments Remember Me Movie review Indie romance a smart choice for Twilight star Pattinson Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 12 2010 at 440 AM View/Post Comments Myles Aronowitz""Twilight"" star Robert Pattinson turns in a fine performance in the romantic drama ""Remember Me.""The funeral of a loved one ends with a burial. The mourning? That never stops. After all it was a half-dozen years ago that Tylers brother committed suicide. A decade since Allys mother was killed in a subway mugging. Their gravestones are well-weathered. But its their survivors who are really the worst for wear stumbling around New York clumsily hurting each other. ""Remember Me"" brings two of them together as Tyler meets Ally at college. Although their romance is sure to dominate the advertising -- the star is ""Twilight"" phenom Robert Pattinson after all -- it isnt the whole point. The real relationships being explored here are between parents and children the living and the dead. Remember Me (PG-13) Summit (112 min.) Directed by Allen Coulter. With Robert Pattinson Emilie de Ravin Pierce Brosnan Chris Cooper. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Three stars Rating note The film contains sexual situations alcohol abuse strong language and violence. Fathers really. Tylers father -- well played by Pierce Brosnan -- has reacted by withdrawing from his family as if that will keep him from being hurt. Allys father -- brought to life by the fine Chris Cooper -- has turned overprotective as if that will keep her from being hurt. Yet neither strategy works and both children -- Tyler angrily and correctly -- rebel against it. ""Remember Me"" is sensitively directed by Allen Coulter (who last did the under-appreciated ""Hollywoodland"") but its really a Pattinson project. (He also helped produce.) A smart one too building on his ""Twilight"" persona as the sensitive yet dangerous bad boy. Its not a new movie character of course -- James Dean certainly did okay with it -- but Pattinson smartly tweaks his own persona dropping the ""Twilight"" neo-goth in favor of contemporary realism playing Tyler as both moody and mischievous. The script a first from Will Fetters serves the other characters less well. Tylers mother needs more fleshing out; his roommate is strictly comic relief. And while Emilie de Ravin is appealing as Ally we never get a true sense of how loss has affected her outside of a few carpe-diem quirks. (She always eats her dessert first -- just in case.) Yet Pattinsons hero is well drawn emerging as yet another descendent of Holden Caulfield (like his ancestor he has a secret grief an adored and precocious kid sister a love for New York -- and a weakness for taking self-destructive stands). And Brosnan who is having a very busy year is fiercely effective as the withholding dad. Young ""Twilight"" fans (and their parents) should be warned of course that this is a far more realistic and adult romance than the beloved vampire saga; movie fans should know that the story takes an abrupt third-act twist and tacks on the sort of arbitrary ""significant"" ending thats better left to first-year creative-writing assignments. But Pattinsons young and older fans? No need to worry at all. The boy is growing up -- and into someone interesting.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + All the sulking and moping and lashing out that Robert Pattinson does in ""Remember Me is pointless. Hes supposed to be playing Tyler a 21-year-old NYU undergrad who hates daddy. Hes like Luke Perry doing James Dean in the dreariest John Hughes movie ever made ""Some Kind of Terrible. Pattinson gets to share a bed and some unfortunate dialogue with Emilie de Ravin who plays Ally a fellow student with unspecified plans. He ""Im undecided. She ""About what? He ""Everything.In his disgusting Brooklyn apartment their bodies press into each other but these two seem too depressed for good sex. He misses his dead brother. She hasnt been on a subway since she saw her mother shot on a platform years ago. Which means her father (Chris Cooper) must drive her to school. From Queens. As it happens Cooper is the same testy cop who just arrested Tyler for injecting himself into a street fight. Tylers best friend Aidan (Tate Ellington) thought Tyler should ask Ally out just to spite her dad. So as it also happens this is another movie where romance starts as a dare the girl knows nothing about.When Tyler isnt taking Ally to a carnival and gazing up at the ceiling hes dropping off his socially awkward kid sister (Ruby Jerins) at her prep school and laying into his rich lawyer dad (Pierce Brosnan) for not loving his children enough. Tyler is sweet. Hes exasperating. He is not a character. ""Remember Me is full of non-people living non-lives. The angst on display is inversely proportional to its cause. Tyler is oppressed by simply having been born.In the first ""Twilight movie Pattinsons brooding made sense. His 108-year-old vampire is dying to have sex but cant. Here his handsome Cro-Magnon face is often dead with sadness and obscured in cigarette smoke. Watching him smolder and erupt you wonder whats the big deal. The movie was written by Will Fetters and directed by Allen Coulter; they move us from one bogus scene to the next.Its unclear why Tylers father is so hostile. So its also unclear why he suddenly warms up. Its unclear why his mother (Lena Olin) and stepfather (Gregory Jbara) tolerate her ex whose obnoxiousness is bested only by Aidans. There is also the matter of not knowing where in time we are let alone where on earth. The city has been cleaned of its ethnic color. Pattinson is English de Ravin Australian Brosnan Irish and Olin Swedish and the placeless tone in their American accents makes it hard to believe were actually in New York.But in the final scenes its obscenely apparent that we couldnt be anywhere else. For 100 minutes ""Remember Me is a bad Nicholas Sparks movie. At about minute 101 it becomes the worst. The movies ambiguity and plot contrivances are part of the joke Fetters and Coulter want to play on our sensitivities. Its parting images are a shocking sucker punch cynically disguised as a plot twist If you dont like these cadaverous people after this revelation the filmmakers seem to be saying shame on you.It would be unfair to spoil the particulars even though in saving you the trip I feel like Id be doing you a favor. But the movie crassly repurposes tragedy to excuse its cliches. Will the Pattinson-besotted scorn the bait-and-switch? My guess is that there will be sniffles and shrines anyway. Good for them. Im appalled to say that I didnt care. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Dating his daughter would annoy the heck out of police sergeant Dad hee-hee.But of course Tyler actually falls in love with Ally and vice versa. They share vindaloo in an Indian restaurant and intimacies in bed. But the terrible secret - that their relationship began as a vengeful dare - looms over director Allen Coulters pile-it-on romance. At a certain point Allys bound to find out whats up and run miserably from Tylers artfully distressed walk-up slamming the door behind her.But theres more drama than that In a prologue set 10 years earlier in 1991 (note those dates) we see the girl Ally and her mom standing on a subway platform. And then we see Allys mother robbed shot and killed with her daughter shaking stunned at her side.As for Tyler hes still grappling with his older brothers suicide. Its a death that led to his parents divorce and to denial grief and rage all around. Tyler hardly talks to his father (Pierce Brosnan) a hard-charging attorney who barely has time for Tylers little sister the precocious art-prodigy grade-schooler Caroline (Ruby Jerins). Meanwhile Tylers mom (Lena Olin) has remarried.Family tragedy cruel twists of fate and wild gesticulations from Pattinson de Ravin Brosnan and as Allys father Chris Cooper fuse into a turbulent storm of angst. Shot in New York and keen on the details of the citys social order (rich and privileged Manhattanites Queens working-class members what-me-worry? college kids) Remember Me is charged up with stormy melodrama. Pattinsons various fan contingents should eat it up and if you dont like the fact that his Tyler dude is pulling on those cigarettes he promises hes going to quit.Contact movie critic Steven Reaat 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The last 10 to 15 minutes of Remember Me turn on such a drastic miscalculation that audiences will scarcely be able to talk about anything else. Thats too bad because before its freighted with more significance than its flimsy architecture can possibly withstand this romantic melodrama strives for something nearly as ambitious It attempts to turn Twilights Robert Pattinson into the millennial James Dean. As a brooding loner gone bohemian in defiance of his cold corporate blueblood father (Pierce Brosnan) Pattinson does his best impersonation of Dean in East Of Eden casting rebellion as the raw byproduct of lingering daddy issues. Though his behavior is often erratic hes a sensitive soul (when he makes love Sigur Ros swells in the background) quietly heroic when it counts. And he has a special talent for alarming overly protective fathers which makes him more attractive. The major problem with Pattinsons ascendancy to the Dean throne His soulfulness is a pose an effect achieved more by hair and makeup (and yes genetics) than the scenes where hes required to emote at high volume. And unlike James Franco who had the ability to pivot out of his Dean typecasting (mostly by embracing his considerable funny side) Pattinson seems locked into a poster-boy image that his performances cant tweak. The busily plotted Remember Me brings Pattinson and lovely NYU student Emilie de Ravin together under peculiar circumstances After a run-in with de Ravins father a cantankerous cop played by Chris Cooper Pattinsons roommate (Tate Ellington) encourages him to take revenge by bedding her. Pattinson and de Ravin fall in love of course but this and other secrets and revelations threaten to sabotage their fledgling relationship. Though generally well-orchestrated by Allen Coulter (Hollywoodland) who evokes turn-of-the-21st-century New York City with subtle specificity the raft of subplots in Remember Me distract from the love story as much as they complicate it. Writer Will Fetters strains to connect Pattinson and de Ravins broken families via rhyming themes of grief loss and estrangement but theres so much happening on the sidelines that the romance peters out. When the film finally goes for broke with that ambitious colossally misconceived finale a tremendous emotional investment in these characters is necessary to pull it off--and even then its prospects would be questionable. Some things simply defy dramatization. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Shes Out Of My League Next Movie Review Green Zone Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Comments Remember Me Video 2010 In 1991 a little girl witnesses her mothers murder on an elevated train platform in Brooklyn; ten years later as a feisty blue-collar student at New York University (Emilie de Ravin of ABCs Lost) she captures the heart of a brooding rich boy (Robert Pattinson). Hes still mourning the death of his brother years earlier for which he blames his father a high-powered attorney (Pierce Brosnan better than his material). Allen Coulter (Hollywoodland) directed this morose and sluggish drama which gets more mileage from Pattinsons anguished profile than from Will Fetterss thunderously overwritten screenplay.

Movies Remember Me by Lisa Schwarzbaum Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr THE READER Robert Pattinson in Remember Me (Myles Aronowitz) Posted March 10 2010 -- 1200 AM EST As a shameless contraption of ridiculously sad things befalling attractive people the engorged romantic tragedy Remember Me stands tall between those towering monuments to teen-oriented cinematic misery Love Story and Twilight Beginning with a shock of urban violence set on a subway platform in 1991 then moving forward to a balmy New York City summer a decade later the movie is one part ""Love means never having to say youre sorry"" and one part ? Edwards warning to Bella ""If youre smart youll stay away from me."" As in Love Story an angry fancy-class young man named Tyler (Robert Pattinson) falls in love with a fine plain-class young woman named Ally (Losts Emilie de Ravin) on the campus of a renowned American university and the couples devotion survives an avalanche of crises that would bury lesser soul mates. As in Twilight Pattinson evokes the fancy-class man using the combined resources of dark glowers milky gazes and fabulously mussed-up hair. Impressively the star stuck with Remember Me even after his post-Twilight celebrity soared. Unfortunately the films alienated rich kid is perilously close in intense disgruntlement and plasma-deficient pallor to that of alienated vampire Edward Cullen. And the overheated woes dreamed up by first-time screenwriter Will Fetters directed by HBO veteran Allen Coulter dont allow the actor room to demonstrate much range as Tyler slouches around on a diet of cigarettes and beer. (He shares a ratty hipster apartment with Tate Ellington as a clownish roommate better suited to cohabitation with the dudes from Knocked Up.) Tyler and Ally each carry scars from family tragedies in their past. But the script offers no tolerable explanation as to why for instance Tylers business-mogul father (Pierce Brosnan sharp in a business suit) is such a cold SOB. Why Tylers kid sister (nicely serious young Ruby Jerins) is bullied by the mean girls at her school. Why Allys policeman dad (the great Chris Cooper outwitted) behaves so inconsistently. Or why Remember Me goes where it goes with such staggeringly misplaced self-seriousness -- a movie with all the hyperventilating hysteria of a 1960s teen-tragedy pop song and all the disposability too.

Corey Haim | Main | Review Shes Out of My League >> Review Remember Me Aside from raking in billions in cash the Twilight franchise has brought its three leads thriving acting careers. Taylor Lautner has become the highest-paid young actor in Hollywood seemingly overnight. Kristen Stewart will star as Joan Jett in a film due in April and Robert Pattinson has earned enough clout to produce movies such as Remember Me for himself. But Remember Me which is more complex and ambitious than the formulaic romance its TV ads promise is no mere star vehicle. Yes theres an element of vanity in Pattinsons James Dean-ish turn as Tyler an angst-filled New York City university student at odds with his powerful father (Pierce Brosnan). Tyler smokes cigarettes quotes poetry sits alone in diners scribbling in his notebook and runs his fingers through his hair. Except that Allen Coulter a recurring producer and director on HBOs The Sopranos has surrounded Pattinson with a stable of actors strong enough to force him into his A-game. Remember Me which follows what happens after the emotionally wounded Tyler falls in love with Ally (Losts Emile de Ravin) a kindred spirit allows him to display an emotional range he hadnt shown in Twilight whether hes holding his own in a screaming match with Brosnan or being a doting older brother to his 11-year-old sister (Ruby Jerins). Remember Me also features Lena Olin as Tylers mother and Chris Cooper as Allys widowed father a cop desperately clinging to his daughter as if she were all he has left in the world. His character at times behaves in ways that seem conceived primarily to drive the story forward (the movie marks the debut of screenwriter Will Fetters). But theres a distinctly bittersweet undertow to the picture that draws you in and helps you overlook the films weaknesses. This is at heart a story about how people get on with their lives after overwhelming loss and learn to live with grief without succumbing to it. Tyler and Ally bond over family tragedy - his brother committed suicide; her mother was killed in a mugging. Pattinson and de Ravin dont make a memorable happy couple - theyre better when theyre brooding - but although their relationship is supposed to be a haven from sadness happiness is an emotion the film has little use for. To call Remember Me a four-hankie weeper does not begin to describe it and its climax almost pulls us out of the movie by incorporating a real-life event into a story that had been until then built purely on glossy fiction. But Coulter wants to explore the act of mourning as a theme and how death sometimes reminds us that every minute of life should be savored. On that level Remember Me certainly succeeds. Remember Me (1/2 out of ) opens in South Florida theaters on Friday March 12. Posted by Rene Rodriguez at 1231 PM in Film Reviews | Permalink The Miami Herald Copyright 2010 The Miami Herald.

Its the first sign that here is a film that wont be content just charting the little measures by which two people become able to love--in fact itll barely do that at all.Flash-forward 10 years to the halcyon days of the Strokes and whatever other significant events happened in NYC circa 2001. Pattinson is histrionically depressed Tyler Keats Hawkins a coasting scruffy NYU student coming up on his 22nd birthday. (Pattinsons great actorly virtue is that he wears clothes well so its too bad hes slackered-out in cargo pants here.) Tyler is less revealed than telegraphed through accessories a dead brother (depth) a pack-a-day habit (angst) a bookstore job (smart) and a rich aloof and permanently disappointed daddy (Pierce Brosnan). He shares his disheveled bachelor pad (a mannequin with a sombrero? You guys) with Tate Ellingtons Aidan a cretin with a spinach-chin goatee who delivers the least-likable horny party-guy best-friend performance since the last one.Meanwhile that little girl on the subway platform has grown up to be not Batman but fellow NYUer Ally (Emilie de Ravin) whose still-bereaved overprotective cop dad (Chris Cooper his conviction mostly quarantined from the rest of the narrative) busts Tyler and Aidan one night. Some coincidences later Tyler will pick up Ally on a revenge-dare ensuring an eventual variation on the ever-popular teen-movie ""Was I a bet?"" breakup after which Tylers so bummed he can barely enjoy himself while watching escapist pre-9/11 multiplex fare like American Pie 2.Before all that wounded souls Tyler and Ally meet cute with crackling undergrad repartee from screenwriter Will Fetters ""I dont date sociology majors."" ""Lucky for you Im undecided."" "" Bout what?"" ""Everything."" Fetters also has a knack for announcing his own cliches which is what passes for self-awareness (""Our fingerprints never fade from the lives we touch. . . or is that just poetic bullshit?"" ""Ive seen this scene a hundred times. . . ."").Allen Coulter not only fails to establish Tyler and Allys bond but his insensate direction makes comic relief painful and dramatic crescendos farce. I had to avert my eyes during Aidans (unlikely) horrifying monologue about having had a sex partner of every race while sweaty Pattinsons barging into Dads boardroom to air the family laundry could melt a tough crowd into giggles (""Youre so just tragically blind""). For her part de Ravin whose research for playing a cops daughter from Queens seems to have been limited to locating the borough on a subway map chews her lower lip expressively and gets some coupling sessions with Pattinson that might seem hot if you currently own an Edward Cullen pencil case.Theres an insult-to-injury quality to a plain bad movie with a ""seize the day"" message (Remember Mes tagline ""Live in the Moments"") which heckles you with all the other things you should or could be doing while youre marking time waiting on the credits. And Remember Me is DMV dull the plot showing so little motion toward a discernable resolution that after a while you wonder if the movie will ever end. Well it does--oh mama does it ever with a crazy long-bomb heave toward epochal significance. (Far be it from me to spoil the surprise; lets just say Robert Pattinson dies in 9/11.) In marked contrast to say Kristen Stewarts detail-perfect Adventureland Pattinson has found a ""small one for me"" Twilight-break project thats more tacky and preposterous than the worst blockbuster phone-in.

Fate sticks its foot out to trip all the characters in all the worst ways in ""Remember Me"" a grave romantic drama with grandiose thematic intentions. Framed in a portentous manner with a calamitous ending that will only come as a surprise to those who havent been paying attention the modestly scaled film delivers some moving and affecting moments amid a preponderance of scenes of frequently annoying people behaving badly. It is precisely the young female fans of star Robert Pattinson who will react most wrenchingly to this doomed romance which should enjoy a short but sweet B.O. life. Pattinson is in heavy James Dean mode here as a reckless unwashed chain-smoking intensely confused pretty boy named Tyler who as Dean did in ""East of Eden"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" has major father issues. Turning his back at least for the moment on his familys wealth -- dad Charles (Pierce Brosnan) is a mighty Wall Street lawyer while classy mom Diane (Lena Olin) has remarried and is raising precocious 11-year-old artist Caroline (Ruby Jerins) -- Tyler rooms with crude low-life Aidan (Tate Ellington) while occasionally attending NYU classes between drinking bouts. On a dare Tyler hits on hot little classmate Ally (Emilie de Ravin) a working-class Queens lass whos the only daughter of a cop (Chris Cooper) who recently threw Tyler in jail after a drunken brawl outside a nightclub. As revealed in the mortifying opening scene Ally as a little girl witnessed her mothers murder on an elevated subway platform; she and Tyler are thus able to morbidly bond over lost loved ones since his own older brother committed suicide on his 22nd birthday -- and Tylers 22nd is just around the corner. As if this werent enough ominous emotional baggage for one movie theres plenty more from the pain little Caroline feels from being ignored by her absent father to the storys overarching historical setting; suffice it to say that the action as announced at the outset is set in 2001. Debuting screenwriter Will Fetters structures the drama so that Tylers and Allys love affair mostly conducted in the formers squalid apartment might seem like an escape from and potential purgative of the jagged emotions that plague them both. Unfortunately the romance never feels intense or deep enough to fully serve this purpose; director Allen Coulter would have achieved a significantly greater connection had he been able to sweep the viewer up in the heady feeling of two wounded people falling hopelessly in love for the first time and trying but failing to prevent the other forces in their lives from gnawing away at their fleeting happiness. This atmosphere of temporary escape never translates into desired privileged moments partly because the lovers must share their nest with Aidan one of the most gratingly obnoxious roommates ever invented. Whenever he turns up you just want him to get lost and matters arent helped by Ellington who adamantly delivers most of his inane remarks at the top of his voice as if thats the only way he can get anyone to listen to him. Its painful. Then theres the matter of Pattinsons opaqueness. No one could deny that the actor is very watchable but hes also either incapable of or coy about letting anyone get inside what hes feeling. One needs to palpably feel Tylers turmoil which at times particularly when his father disappoints Caroline most callously nearly eats him alive. Tyler and Ally once or twice become physically rambunctious but never get carried away resulting in less-than-fulsome viewer investment in their relationship. Best known for her six seasons on ""Lost"" de Ravin registers well with an agreeably assertive screen presence. Beautiful in some shots and almost ordinary-looking in others the diminutive Aussie thesp has a chameleonlike presence that calls to mind a cross between Julie Christie and Samantha Morton. Cooper nails the fear and frustration of a limited man whos already lost one significant woman in his life and senses hes about to lose another. Brosnan concisely registers the frosty and seemingly unthawable outer layer of a downtown titan. Even if you know or think you know whats coming at the end the emotional undertow is hard to resist and is of a piece with the pictures articulated philosophical position about doing all one can during ones brief moment on earth. Gotham locations are evocatively but unostentatiously used Marcelo Zarvos fine score stirs added emotional turbulence and tech contributions are more than solid.
