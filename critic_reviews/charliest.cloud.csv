Charlie Tahan and Zac Efron in the romantic drama Charlie St. Cloud. Diyah Pera/Universal Pictures Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald7/28/2010 Editor rating 2 Like the child protagonist of an earlier highly acclaimed movie the eponymous hero of Charlie St. Cloud sees dead people -- or at least in his case dead people he once knew. For example he has a long conversation with the ghost of a high-school buddy who enrolled in the military after graduation and was killed in action overseas. More important every day at sunset Charlie (Zac Efron) meets up with his dead little brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) in the woods near the cemetery to chat and throw a baseball around. Charlie has been doing this for five years. An expert sailor he passed up a scholarship to Stanford in order to keep his promise to Sam who was killed in a car accident. Charlie was driving. Based on a novel by Ben Sherwood and constructed as a showcase for Efrons dramatic talents the movie is a young mans journey to overcome the guilt that has paralyzed his life. Charlie is so obsessed with making sure he shows up to meet with Sam that he organizes every day around the designated time letting the rest of the world go on without him. Hes reluctant to pursue a relationship with the beautiful Tess (Amanda Crew) who is also an avid boater. His single mother (Kim Basinger in a cameo) has moved away apparently unable to shake her son out of his self-torturing state. Even the paramedic (Ray Liotta) who resuscitated Charlie after the accident and bumps into him years later encourages him to shake off the doldrums because theres probably a good reason why he survived the crash. After many scenes of crying and emoting by Efron who is shot by director Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down) the way Hitchcock shot Grace Kelly -- glamorously and adoringly -- a major (although illogical) plot twist arrives that gives the film a much-needed jolt. But by then the picture is beyond rescue. Efron is clearly talented and he can shed a single tear on cue in the same uncanny manner Demi Moore did in Ghost. But Charlie St. Cloud is primarily a vehicle to prove the actor can do more than dance and sing. Its more of a demo reel for Efron than a movie. His predominant fan base though wont mind a bit.

The local fishing-village community think Charlies gone mad for five years he works in a graveyard and plays baseball with his dead brother in the woods every night. But we know hes still heartthrob Zac Efron - hes still shaving every day for starters.That said this is a fantasy and the suspension of disbelief is key as the film moves further into supernatural territory (lets just say itll please fans of Ghost). But as the drama increases so do the clumsy flashbacks and corny lines this relies on cheap tricks to force tears even if those tricks work. As for the supporting cast Tahan is suitably adorable while Amanda Crew will divide audiences as love interest Tess. At least her character has her own mind and career shes about to sail around the world solo. Theres also an amusing turn from young Brit Augustus Prew who brings a welcome streak of irreverence as Charlies party-boy colleague. Cynics need not apply.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 30 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Jan. 29 2014 356PM EST Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Charlie St. CloudDirected by Burr SteersWritten by Craig Pearce and Lewis ColickStarring Zac Efron Amanda Crew and Charlie TahanClassification PGThe new Zac Efron movie Charlie St. Cloud is a packaged teen weepie that often feels stranger than it intends to be. Efron the Disney heartthrob with the cerulean irises and artfully messy hair has been candid in characterizing the film as a ladder rung in his career between High School Musical stardom and more grown-up serious roles. What ""serious"" means for young actors as we know from Miley Cyruss The Last Song is maudlin and Charlie St. Cloud is no exception. In early scenes Efrons Charlie is a cocky high-school sailing prodigy who has a hard-working mom (Kim Basinger) and pesky 11-year-old brother Sam (Charlie Tahan). On his graduation night Charlie gets into a car crash that kills Sam sending Charlie into a prolonged funk.He puts off his Stanford scholarship and takes a job as a caretaker at the cemetery where Sam is buried. Every day after listening to his sardonic English buddy (Augustus Prew) and wiping bird droppings off the gravestones he heads out at sunset to practise baseball with his dead sibling.Charlie St. Cloud was adapted from a 2005 novel by former Good Morning America executive producer Ben Sherwood. The New Age fable about grief and letting go has been transferred from its original Massachusetts setting to the Pacific Northwest (played by British Columbia) a realm of forest and mountains and teen angst already well-known to Twilight fans.The director is Burr Steers who directed Efron before in last years age-switch comedy 17 Again as well as the superior 2002 black comedy Igby Goes Down. With Charlie St. Cloud its as if Steers has put a muzzle on his sardonic impulses. Efron meanwhile poses and wisecracks competently but is unpersuasive as a brooder. At best he stares blankly off in the distance and you forget about the story and wonder what kind of shade those eyes are. When Charlie starts hitting the Jack Daniels you cant help feeling the bottle should have a rubber nipple on it.On the subject of nipples we see Efrons torso as often as his tears. Theres nothing subtle in the way the emotional strings are yanked here Romantic kisses appear to be set against sunsets of oil painted on velvet; the piano tinkles and orchestra swells to augment every emotional peak. At its most mawkish moment Ray Liotta pops up as the emergency medic who brought Charlie back to life. Now dying of cancer he meets the young man again to tell him that God brought him back to life for a reason.God (who occasionally seems to stare down on the forest glades from high aerial shots) decides to reveal his purpose by introducing the comely Tess (Canadian actress Amanda Crew) Charlies former sailing rival and grown-up hottie. First though their schedules conflict. Shes about to embark on a six-month around-the-world sailing trip and hes got his nightly baseball practice with his dead brother to attend to.All this sets us up for a ""twist"" ending but if you dont predict it a half-hour before its revelation you surely must have nodded off during baseball practice.

Starring Zac Efron Kim Basinger Amanda Crew Dave Franco Donal Logue Tegan Moss Charlie Tahan Brenna OBrien Augustus Prew Julia Maxwell Director Burr Steers Release Opened Jul 30 2010  Editorial Review Sometimes you should mess with perfectionBy Michael OSullivanFriday July 30 2010""Charlie St. Cloud"" like its star Zac Efron is a gorgeous unblemished thing. Both would be much improved with a tiny flaw or two. Dont get me wrong. Efron is nice to look at. Many moviegoers will no doubt go just to see him smile and brood and take off his shirt which he does with a regularity approaching that of Matthew McConaughey. (Theres even a scene where he jumps into a pond in his clothing turning the movie momentarily into a wet T-shirt contest. Ladies and gentlemen we have a winner) Whats more the 22-year-old (of ""High School Musical"" fame) is turning into a pretty decent actor. As the titular Charlie a young man whose guilt and grief over his 11-year-old brothers death -- in a car Charlie was driving -- has paralyzed him emotionally Efron works hard to make you believe his characters angst. The scenes in which he plays catch with dead brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) with whom Charlie has a daily play date in the woods are particularly touching. And when Tess (Amanda Crew) a former high school classmate of Charlies tries to reconnect with him Charlies reluctance to allow himself real-world pleasure is almost palpable. Its just that the movie like the man is a little too perfect. From the insistently gooey score that pushes and prods you to feel Charlies pain to the sparkling cinematography that turns the fictional Pacific Northwest setting of Quincy Bay into an ad for a vacation time share the movie has a machine-extruded gloss that makes it harder not easier to swallow its difficult emotions. Youll want to buy into them -- Efron is a very good salesman -- but theyre so smooth and creamy going down they barely register as feelings at all. Based on the novel ""The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud"" by Ben Sherwood the story itself has a predictable arc. A promising high school sailor with an athletic scholarship to Stanford Charlie has put his plans -- and his life -- on hold after Sam dies taking on a job as cemetery caretaker so that he can be near his brother with whom he has a pact to meet every day at sunset. Five years after the accident when Charlie and Tess start falling for each other Charlies connection to Sam or Sams spirit is threatened. Sam of course is a walking metaphor for survivors guilt. Charlie himself almost died in the accident but was resuscitated by a paramedic (Ray Liotta) whose defibrillator has left scars on Charlies chest that serve as constant reminders. The self-help-heavy script includes such aphorisms as ""You hurt because youre alive"" (courtesy of Sams ghost) and ""At some point we all have to let go"" (courtesy of Tess). Those lines will come as no surprise. What will come as a surprise is something of a plot twist having to do with Charlies ability to ""see"" dead people a result of his having visited the other side. In addition to Sam Charlie also communes briefly with the ghost of another old school chum (Dave Franco) who was killed in Iraq. I wont spoil things except to say that this development will probably catch you off guard. It did me. I only wish there were more about the movie that was off-balance. The sudden loss of equilibrium gives the film however temporarily some traction in its gliding progress toward a rather foregone conclusion. Like the minor scrapes and abrasions that appear on Efrons face after the accident and then fade away -- and like those persistent paddle scars -- its the most interesting feature about a too slick and only partially satisfying ""Charlie St. Cloud.""Contains brief crude language mild sensuality a bar fight and a frightening car accident.

Zac Efron sees dead people -- and almost-dead people -- in ""Charlie St. Cloud"" a maudlin and unintention ally hilarious romantic wee pie whose main assets are Efrons baby blues and the even more lovely British Columbia locations masquerading as New England. Efrons Charlie works as the caretaker of a cemetery containing the remains of his brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) who died five years earlier in a drunken car crash for which the brooding Charlie still holds himself responsible. One day a lovely young woman named Tess (Amanda Crew) turns up to tend her fathers grave -- and wouldnt you know shes a famous yachter about to embark on a round-the-world race. PHOTOS ZAC EFRON PHOTOS DISNEY STARS BRANCHING OUT This complicates Charlies relationship with Sam with whom he talks during baseball practice every day at sunset. (Heck in this town it almost always seems to be sunset.) Sam fears Charlie will ""abandon"" him because Charlies own interest in sailing -- abandoned along with a college scholarship after that unfortunate accident -- has been reawakened by Tess. Our hero is also being urged to get on with his life not only by his mother (Kim Basinger in a paycheck cameo) but also the dying paramedic (Ray Liotta) who brought Charlie back to life after the accident. Things come to a head when Tess shows up with a not-so-mysterious head wound -- and leaves Charlie a note saying ""save me"" after they spend the night together. No shes not asking Charlie to save her from a bad script although she probably should. By this point the not-untalented Efron is drowning in cliches -- the movie literally hits bottom when Charlie hits the bottle. ""Charlie St. Cloud"" is unsteadily piloted by Burr Steers who also guided Efron in the far better ""17 Again"" and directed the well-received ""Igby Goes Down"" in 2002. When the dying Liotta gives Charlie a St. Jude medal -- the patron saint of hopeless causes -- its pretty clear that the movie itself is a hopeless cause.

"Charlie St. Cloud High school funeral | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCharlie St. Cloud High school funeralTeen idol Zac Efron is hoping Charlie St. Cloud will redefine his career as a serious actor. Probably not.The freakishly handsome Zac Efron (shown with Charlie Tahan who plays younger brother Sam) is in practically every frame of Charlie St. Cloud.  (Diyah Pera)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterThu. July 29 2010Charlie St. Cloud Starring Zac Efron Amanda Crew Donal Logue Charlie Tahan and Kim Basinger. Directed by Burr Steers. 109 minutes. At major theatres. PGCharlie St. Cloud sees dead people.Actually mostly its his younger brother Sam who died in a tragic car accident and whom Charlie has made a promise to meet every day in the woods as the sunset cannons boom at nearby idyllic Quincy Harbor. Also a school chum swings by the cemetery where Charlie works on his way to -- chorus of angels -- the Great Beyond. After the accident for which Charlie partly blames himself he drops his scholarship to Stamford and drops out of life for the next five years. The townsfolk pretty much think hes crazy. In one memorable scene two teenage girls sigh dreamily over the fetchingly troubled young man before a third one pipes up to set things straight ""Puppies are cute. Hes weird.""Article Continued BelowCharlie St. Cloud is a transition film for teen/tween idol Zac Efron after a string of wildly successful High School Musical movies and the well-received 17 Again. It has been widely reported Efron dropped a chance to star in the remake of Footloose for this more serious work which just goes to show that despite a career marked by smart choices and a carefully managed image no one is fallible.For Efron his physical beauty -- the gorgeous blue eyes the slightly mussed hair the chiseled features the sculpted body recently featured on the cover of People -- is both a blessing and a curse. Legions of fans -- not exclusively confined to swooning maidenhood -- have given him a springboard to a lasting career. But his bounteous good looks will always beg the cynical question ""Yeah hes a hottie but can he really act?""Actually he can -- just not well enough to make Charlie St. Cloud a great movie. Efron has genuine camera presence solid timing and a gift for comedy with an edge that serves him well in portraying a slightly unbalanced young man hobbled by grief. Efron has frequent occasion to turn on the waterworks but it never feels overdone.Yet while Efron does his best to carry the film the rest of Charlie St. Cloud feels a bit too formulaic pretentious and cloying and takes a too long to deliver the dramatic fireworks.In opting for such a leisurely pace director Burr Steers (who also directed 17 Again) risks having bored audience members speculate on such minutiae as Why bring in an Oscar-winning actress of Kim Basingers stature only to give her so pitifully few scenes as the mother? Likewise Ray Liottas brief appearance as the paramedic who brings Charlie back from ""flat-line"" status and who surfaces five years later to explain to him hes been given a ""second chance"" for a reason doesnt work because it feels so contrived. When his widow delivers his St. Judes medal (the patron saint of lost causes) to Charlie it raises the schmaltz to an uncomfortable level of queasiness.Still if your intent is to drink in the stunning hunkiness of Zac Efron hes there in virtually every frame brooding wry intense and actually somewhat believable. Too bad the rest of this ghost story doesnt hold up.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    23degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Diyah Pera) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday July 30 2010 400 AM Title Charlie St. Cloud Though it was directed by Burr Steers ""Charlie St. Cloud"" feels more like a misguided collaboration among Nicholas Sparks M. Night Shyamalan and Billy Graham. And if Zac Efron hadnt signed on this sappy spiritual fantasy would certainly have skipped the cineplex altogether -- in favor of eternal rotation on cable.Steers previous work includes the decidedly secular ""17 Again"" and ""Weeds."" But in adapting Ben Sherwoods novel ""The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud"" Steers trades humor for platitudes.Worse he doesnt so much tug at our heartstrings as yank violently. In fact when we meet Charlie (Efron) and his brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) their bond is so overemphasized we immediately sense imminent tragedy. But if you dont want any spoilers read no further.Still here? Thats okay because Sams early death provides the primary story line. Charlie is so devastated that he goes to work at the graveyard pausing every afternoon to play baseball with his dead brother. This unusual arrangement is interrupted only when his former sailing competitor (an appealing Amanda Crew) tries to pull Charlie back to the living.Or does she? Nothing is quite as it seems in this mystical odyssey.Everything is however blindingly obvious from the scripts religious overtones to the way beautiful British Columbia is shot to look like heaven.Somehow Efron rises above the sentimentality creating an undeniably likable portrayal of a young man in turmoil. Those who havent seen him since he graduated from ""High School Musical"" may not believe it but this former tween idol is the saving grace in a movie that needs all the miracles it can muster.

ABOUT THE MOVIECharlie St. Cloud   (out of four) Stars Zac Efron Charlie Tahan Amanda Crew Donal Logue Ray Liotta Kim BasingerDirector Burr SteersDistributor Universal PicturesRating PG-13 for language including some sexual references an intense accident scene and some sensualityRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesOpens Friday nationwide In Charlie St. Cloud Zac Efron sees dead people -- with a few caveats. As the eponymous Charlie Efron spends large swaths of this sentimental movie brooding and mired in grief. But his legions of swooning fans neednt worry. Despite his dark turn he remains adorable and well-groomed even as a gloomy loner. And there are still plenty of shots of Efron shirtless (or in a wet T-shirt) and windswept sailing off into the sunset. TRAILER Check out a preview of Charlie St. Cloud PHOTOS Wade into our Zac Efron gallery Director Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down) throws in the occasional picturesque Northwestern coastal shot but Efron is lovingly photographed throughout from a tight shot on his piercing blue eyes gazing into the heavens to a lingering focus on his toned abs and broad shoulders. His tousled seafaring scenes are meant to highlight his carefree status as a talented high school senior with a love for sailing bound for Stanford and likely success. But Charlies life is derailed after he nearly dies in a terrible car accident that kills his 11-year-old brother Sam (Charlie Tahan). (This is no spoiler; the trailers and commercials have already given it away.) Like many actors before him Efron is in some ways hamstrung by his good looks and easy charisma. Meaty complex parts arent generally offered to young handsome actors especially if they got their start as Disney stars. But based on his performance in last years Me and Orson Welles his breezy comic timing in 17 Again and his heartfelt efforts here Efron seems poised to mature into a substantive actor. Five years after the accident Charlie is like the walking wounded mucking around in a dead-end job as a cemetery caretaker. At the graveyard he has an annoyingly wacky British gravedigging pal Alistair (Augustus Prew) whose presence is contrived and tonally wrong as if he wandered in from the comedy at the arthouse down the street. Charlie survived the car accident for a reason he is told by the religious paramedic who saved him (Ray Liotta). He shrugs it off. But soon he is compelled to choose between clinging to the past and loosening his bond with his beloved brother and embarking on a relationship with fellow sailor Tess (Amanda Crew). Some of Efrons best scenes are with Tahan. Theres an appealing gentle chemistry between the two. Efron is in almost every frame and has a natural physical ease on camera. Hes convincing enough but the sentimental story suffers from ladling on lightweight spirituality and piling on supernatural twists that dont follow their own internal logic. The movie tries to capture the crushing weight of loss but between the insipid pop tunes and the repetitive shots cutting away to a lighthouse on a scenic outcropping it feels more like a film version of a condolence card.

"Charlie St. Cloud movie review Zac Efron strips and sobs but never musters emotion |       NJ.com comments Charlie St. Cloud movie review Zac Efron strips and sobs but never musters emotion Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 30 2010 at 808 AM View/Post Comments Diyah Pera/Courtesy Universal Pictures/MCTZac Efron left and Charlie Tahan portray brothers in the tween melodrama ""Charlie St. Cloud."" Generally in a weepie its not a good sign if the people on screen are crying more than the audience is. So things do not seem to bode well for ""Charlie St. Cloud"" a new tween melodrama starring Zac Efron. In the course of little more than an hour-and-a-half the perpetually damp thespian weeps from his left eye then his right. He tears up manfully. He blubbers uncontrollably. He bathes his pretty face in a sheen of lachrymose moisturizer. While I sat there with cheeks so arid Omar Sharif could have led a caravan across them. Its not that I dont enjoy a good cry; its that the operative word is ""good."" And ""Charlie St. Cloud"" -- from its awful title to its annoyingly perfect photography -- is a schmaltzy sniffle at best. The story is based on a novel by Ben Sherwood a former television producer who seems to have read an awful lot of Nicholas Sparks novels. Like those popular books his contains a seaside setting young lovers a tragic loss and a heavy dose of everything-always-works-out-for-the-best philosophizing. Unlike Sparks though you never get the feeling that this author believes in any of it. Instead the story as adapted by several other hands (who made the characters younger) and directed by Burr Steers (who last made Efrons ""17 Again"") just feels like a clumsy bit of juvenile manipulation. Movie Review Charlie St. Cloud (PG-13) Universal (100 min.) Directed by Burr Steers. With Zac Efron Amanda Crew Ray Liotta Kim Basinger. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains brief violence and mild sensuality. Stephen Whittys review ONE AND A HALF STARS Sunlight slants through trees. A couple shares gentle kisses. Zac Efron takes his shirt off. Plaintive pop plays on the soundtrack. Adult characters hastily provide exposition. Zac Efron takes his shirt off. Falling stars streak across the sky. A dark storm brews. And yeah here come Zacs pecs again. The heart of the story is a deliberately unscary ghost story with Efron unable -- literally -- to let go of his dead kid brother. (He meets the spirit every day at sunset to play catch in the graveyard.) Theres also a rich girl and some mild town-and-gown class conflict. But none of it really develops into anything no matter how much Efron turns on the waterworks or pares down his wardrobe. Amanda Crew is stubbornly unappealing as his love interest and Augustus Prew -- isnt that a Lemony Snicket villain? -- is miserably unfunny as the supposed comic relief. Better is Charlie Tahan as the departed Sam. Hes an easy unaffected young actor and a steady presence throughout the film -- unlike Kim Basinger who after two quick scenes is suddenly reduced to a voice on a long-distance phone call or Ray Liotta who is given the thankless job of stating (and re-stating) the films theme. Which is what exactly? Life is for the living? Death is for the dead? Tears are for peeling onions? I was never sure. (Particularly since the one fact the movie manages to firmly establish about Charlie -- he sees dead people -- it ends up sort of throwing out the window.) But hey if you want to see Zac Efron cry ""Charlie St. Cloud"" awaits. And if you want to see me cry just make me watch it again. Stephen Whitty (212) 790-4435 or swhittystarledger.com.

"Charlie St. Cloud | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; charlie-st-cloud ) Charlie St. Cloud (United States 2010) July 29 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Im not a Zac Efron hater; I thought he did a solid job in Me and Orson Welles a film that showcased his ability to act when given the opportunity. However in Charlie St. Cloud (as in his previous outing for director Burr Steers 17 Again) Zefron is used exclusively as a chick magnet. Or to put it another way his name on the marquee is designed to fill theater seats with young girls. He does his part looking soulful as he gazes into the distance before removing his shirt and doing something manly. One wonders whether Efron has been studying at the Taylor Lautner School of Acting. Its not much of a spoiler to reveal that Charlie St. Cloud involves the supernatural. Whether the Dead People represent ghosts figments of Charlies imagination or psychic projections is never made clear but I dont think were supposed to think deeply about such things. A central problem with the premise is the lack of ""rules."" Ghost stories and other tales of the supernatural need to show consistency otherwise anything goes. Even though Charlie St. Cloud is based on a novel by Ben Sherwood it provides the impression that the filmmakers are making things up as they go along and a lot of those things dont make sense. But Steers and his screenwriters arent aiming for logic; theyre leading up to the next opportunity for Efron to remove his shirt. The narrative which clumsily incorporates elements of Ghost The Sixth Sense and Field of Dreams into a total mess takes place in the Pacific Northwest (it was actually filmed in British Columbia but I believe the intended setting is the United States). Charlie (Efron) having graduated from high school is looking forward to his final summer at home before heading off to college on a sailing scholarship. He and his younger brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) have a good relationship although Charlie sometimes chafes at having to babysit for the 11-year old. Then the unthinkable happens. Charlie and Sam are involved in a brutal car accident that kills them both. A paramedic (Ray Liotta) is able to revive Charlie but Sam is D.O.A. Charlie however having been to the other side is able to see dead people including his brother with whom he plays catch in the woods every day for five years. Charlie becomes something of a recluse. His mother (Kim Basinger) moves away and Charlie begins working as the caretaker at the cemetery where his brother is buried. His daily highlight remains the hour every evening that he spends in Sams company at least until he starts flirting with Tess (Amanda Crew) a local girl who is making plans to sail her boat around the world. The screenplay for Charlie St. Cloud is so full of cheats and inconsistencies that they pour from the screen. One doesnt need 3-D for this sort of in-your-face exercise. I recently praised Chris Nolans Inception for demanding viewer concentration. Charlie St. Cloud requires the opposite. The less attentive one is the more likely the movie will pay dividends. The ""twist"" is transparent unless you spend half the movie in the lavatory. In that case it may be surprising (although it still doesnt make sense and no attempt is made to explain things). However although the idea of spending a portion of Charlie St. Clouds running time reading the graffiti in a rest room has its appeal I wouldnt recommend it. You might miss one of those occasions when Zac Efron doffs his shirt. Despite spending more of the movie posing than acting Efron generates a little chemistry with his female co-star Amanda Crew. Crews character Tess is infinitely more interesting than Charlie but since she lacks box office drawing power she ends up doing the sorts of things that female co-starts do in sappy romantic movies. She does not however spend time staring soulfully into space and she most definitely does not take off her shirt and strut around topless. Charlie Tahan the young actor playing Sam is nails-on-the-blackboard awful. The worst part is even when his character is dead he continues to annoy. Kim Basinger and Ray Liotta have small parts. The most interesting thing about Liotta is that even though hes not playing a lunatic bad guy you keep waiting for him to start frothing at the mouth. Basinger looks bedraggled and bored. Charlie St. Cloud will almost certainly appeal to its core demographic and absolutely no one else. Its a little like Sex and the City 2 in that regard. The Efron fans in the audience cooed appreciatively every time he stared soulfully into the distance and shrieked orgasmically every time he removed his shirt. That I suppose is how it should be. I just wish I hadnt wasted 105 minutes of my time to confirm it.

More about Charlie St. Cloud >> Charlie (Zac Efron) a townie in a New England hamlet (in Ben Sherwoods novel on which the film is based it was the seaside village of Marblehead Mass.) is a championship sailor. His kid brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) serves as his first mate. Despite the brothers skills the rich boys look down on the St. Clouds. Their dad has disappeared; their mom (Kim Basinger) is a nurse who works double shifts to support them. The girls however look at them with starry eyes. So too does cinematographer Enrique Chediak who for reasons pertaining to the plot shoots them in the glowing magic-time of dusk. After tragedy strikes Charlie is adrift in his own private Bermuda Triangle. In this gentle fable Charlie moves from living among the dead to living with the living. Director Burr Steers who helmed (no pun intended) Efron in the charming body-switch comedy 17 Again shrouds the film with a guilt-edged melancholy that evokes the atmosphere of Ghost and The Sixth Sense. How without dishonoring the departed does Charlie move past grief to acceptance? Initially putting the high-wattage Efron on a dimmer seems like a tragic waste of natural resources comparable to brown contact lenses on Paul Newmans baby blues. But Steers takes his time and it pays off in Efrons subdued performance earnest and yearning. (The same cannot be said of the low-angle shots of the backlit Efron heroically framed against the horizon more like a generic GQ model than a specific character.) Steers film which advocates grieving and growing rather than remaining stuck in mourning limbo is an unapologetically schmaltzy affair enormously effective on heartstrings and tear ducts. The byplay between Efron and newcomer Tahan as his brother has a warmth and intimacy that establish the films tone. The performances carry the film. As boozy Alistair Charlies outspoken coworker at a cemetery Augustus Prew supplies the comic relief. In the equivalent of Whoopi Goldbergs role in Ghost - or Thomas Lennons in 17 Again - Prew nails every punchline. Similarly Amanda Crew as Tess a competitive sailor preparing an around-the-world voyage is touching as Charlies female counterpart. While the vealcake shots of the shirtless Efron do not advance the story for the most part the filmmakers explore the faces of the young actors searching as they are for answers to the question of why they were put on this earth.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Charlie St. Cloud Drama. Starring Zac Efron Amanda Crew and Charlie Tahan. Directed by Burr Steers. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Movies which are all about the visuals have a time-honored way of representing virtue - by casting someone beautiful. Beauty is synonymous with goodness onscreen but the best thing of all is to be beautiful in an interesting way to have a mind at work and a certain self-possession to suggest a variety of moods and passions ... which leads us to Zac Efron in ""Charlie St. Cloud."" Efron is a very young guy - hes only 22 and probably shot this film when he was 21 - but something in the sculpted geometry of his face and in the old-soul look in his eyes makes him more than a pretty kid. Put that face in close-up and Efron reads as a moral idea one that has something to do with youthful striving and sensitivity with meaning well and working hard. Efron gets that much credit just standing there and then lo and behold he can act. ""Charlie St. Cloud"" is a delicate film - not flimsy but fragile - that holds together on the strength of Efrons physical presence and performance. It tells a story about love and loss and the beatings that life and time inflict on poor suffering humanity. Last years ""17 Again"" which Efron made for the same director Burr Steers was like a workout for this film It dealt with similar issues and concerns but operated with the safety hatchof comedy.

It just offers the real stuff - heartbreak exultation metaphysical mystery - under no cover of self-protective cynicism. It dares to be corny but isnt. It dares to cross the frontier from painful to so-painful-its funny but it never does. All this has a lot to do with Steers command of tone and of the good taste of the screenplay based on a novel by Ben Sherwood. But none of this would matter without an actor at the center who simply in his screen essence embodies the right qualities of humanity gravity and aspiration. The film begins the way some movies end with the climax of an exciting boat race. Charlie though from a working-class background is a natural aristocrat with a gift for boating and a breezy winning manner. The movie takes pains to establish his relationship with his 11-year-old brother (Charlie Tahan) and in the movies first minutes we tend to see Charlie through the younger brothers eyes as infinitely capable glamorous and glory bound. The reversal of fortune comes with brutal suddenness. Every other review Im sure will tell you what that reversal is - dont read them. Suffice it to say that its the kind of blow that would challenge anyones emotional capacity to recover. Fifteen minutes into the film Charlie has lost his ambition and his life has taken a mystical turn. Amanda Crew plays a young woman from the same town who has held onto her boating dreams and is planning a solo run around the world. But if youre expecting the usual thing - the girlfriend who brings our hero back to life - this movie has more integrity and sophistication than that. In Crews it also finds an ideal co-star for Efron one who is as strikingly intelligent as he is strikingly pretty. By becoming the object of Charlies interest she confirms our faith in Charlies seriousness and probity. -- Advisory Sexual situations.

"Movie review Charlie St. Cloud - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-SailingMovie review Charlie St. CloudZac Efron shows promise as an actor. But director Burr Steers fails to fully embrace the films weepy potential.July 30 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Charlie St. Cloud"" which stars the very swoony Zac Efron as a haunted hunk in need of saving is a study in restraint when restraint is really the last thing needed here. Everything about the story screams heartbreaking weepy from its premise a two brothers bad car wreck one dies the other left with mountains of guilt a to the tears that well up and settle into Efrons deep sea blue eyes. So director Burr Steers who dealt nicely with the young heartthrobs comedy assets in "" 17 Again"" should have dragged us through one gut-wrenching scene after another. But he doesnt. Too bad because there are times when the sentimental possibilities are just so shamelessly obvious and Ben Sherwoods novel certainly set the stage that the tragedy should be played for all its worth (a la ""The Notebook"" sniffle sniffle). Instead ""Charlie St. Cloud"" skims across the surface and the beautiful Pacific Northwest bay where the film was shot a its also a sailing story a with Efron trying his best to keep this boat afloat. The film opens as Charlie (Efron) a working-class kid with an adorable but annoying younger brother Sam (a very engaging Charlie Tahan) is slicing through rough waters in his dingy racing against the well-turned-out rich kids in the local regatta. But our hero with help from his little bro wins the race just another success to go with top grades and the sailing scholarship to Stanford. This kid clearly has promise but in case you havent figured that out by now the school principal says ""I expect great things from you"" when he hands over that hard-earned diploma while Sam and their equally hard-working single mom ( Kim Basinger) proudly look on. Meanwhile young Sam has a baseball jones for the Boston Red Sox and Charlie agrees to play catch with him every night until he heads off to college in the fall. But into every life some rain must fall and soon there it is a a dark and raining night a drunk driver a crash a crash-cart manned by paramedic Ray Liotta and everything changes for Charlie whos brought back to life only to be faced with burying Sam. Now heres where things really get mystical and spiritual two elements that have befuddled some of the best filmmakers around as Peter Jacksons disappointing ""The Lovely Bones"" reminded us last year. Steers is not immune to the difficulties as he deals with the fact that Sam is dead but hes not exactly gone either. The filmmaker opts for a very thin line between the real and the ethereal or really more like no line though director of photography Enrique Chediak does a nice job of making whatever reality Charlie is in beautiful. Flash forward five years. Moms left for Portland Ore.; Charlies beloved dingy is dry-docked; his Stanford sailing plans have been scuttled. Instead hes a caretaker at the cemetery where Sam is buried and just before sunset each day Sam materializes and the brothers play catch and talk about life. Enter Tess ( Amanda Crew) a former classmate back home prepping for a solo sail around the world and clearly love interest material for Charlie. Heres where things start speeding up (finally) with screenwriters Craig Pearce (who often writes with director Baz Luhrmann ""Moulin Rouge"" among others) and Lewis Colick (""Ladder 49"") throwing in everything but the kitchen sink including raging storms nonessential anniversary parties badly maintained grave sites to say nothing of a bunch of one-note scenes for various ancillary characters and heavy-handed dialogue like ""God has a plan for you."" The central conceit of the film turns on Tess the one person in Charlies life who actually might help him come to terms with Sams death. But the film zips through their early encounters so quickly the actors barely have time to spell ""chemistry"" much less develop any. So when Charlies ""Sophies Choice"" moment comes its not nearly as painful or as emotional as it should be. The good news is that Efron continues to get better with each film; he just hasnt gotten a role yet that will finally put his acting potential to the test. So for now Efron remains an unrealized dream and ""Charlie St. Cloud"" an unrealized movie though judging from the ""ooohhs"" and ""awwwws"" from the audience for his core tween-girl fans thats more than enough. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESZac Efron grows up with Charlie St. CloudJuly 29 2010Upbeat musical vs. blood and horrorOctober 24 2008MORE STORIES ABOUTSailingSamZac EfronCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-charlie-st.cloud-20100730,0,1860387.story",200,charliest.cloud16,charliest.cloud,latimes

Moving beyond high-school roles and away from the song-and-dance silliness of ""Hairspray"" and ""High School Musical"" he takes a confident half-step toward becoming a mature romantic lead. The film itself? Not so good. ""Charlie St. Cloud"" is an over-sentimental effort that incorporates love drama bereavement comedy seagoing adventure and mystical uplift like a Baskin-Robbins cone precariously balancing all 31 flavors. But Efron is not complacently relying on his looks like a junior varsity Ben Affleck. Charlie is a champion sailor heading to Stanford on an athletic scholarship when a horrible mistake ruins his dreams. His future crushed Charlie signs on as a cemetery caretaker. He becomes locked in his own head unable to connect. Who will rescue this emotionally withdrawn dreamboat? Could it be feisty beautiful Tess Carroll (Amanda Crew) a former classmate who plans to be one of the first women to sail solo around the globe? Who saves whom and how is one of the films secrets but fans of ""Titanic"" and ""Ghost"" will feel as if theyre watching a double feature. The near-death trauma that derailed Charlies life gave him the ability to see spirits. For much of the film we can interpret his visions as symbols of our loused-up heros unresolved emotional issues. As it turns out the apparitions are real and they play a key role in the rescue-at-sea finale. The gimmick is staggeringly absurd but fans of transcendent love stories like to believe that our souls can do impossible things so let them have their fun. In some more enjoyable passages Efron aims to stretch beyond bland boyish affability. Lets not overstate things He doesnt have the rebel reflexes of a natural antihero or the acting technique to convert brooding into a poetic statement. But its clear Efrons working at becoming something more than catnip for the Hot Topic crowd. Hes trying on dark complicated emotions for size. Theres a moment of genuine drama when a taunting former classmate of Charlies pops up to sneer and Charlie snaps. He comes off not as a hero confronting a bully but as a guy who needs to get a grip on himself. Its not groundbreaking but its a move in the right direction. Director Burr Steers captures the weathered beauty of a New England seaside community and the peach-cheeked good looks of his star in countless amber-tinted sunset close-ups. Efron and Charlie Tahan who plays his 11-year-old brother have the best acting moments demonstrating a likably cantankerous chemistry. CHARLIE ST. CLOUD  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for language including some sexual references an intense accident scene and some sensuality. The other actors fare poorly. Crew is an underdeveloped love interest -- its not clear whats so special about her. Ray Liotta and Kim Basinger are squandered in brief cameos. But then we must understand that this project is a mainstream star vehicle for a matinee idol. ""Charlie St. Cloud"" will have Zac fans snapping in the breeze like so many spinnakers. The rest of us will be a little bit seasick. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The romantic fantasy Charlie St. Cloud takes place in a seaside town where its always magic hour and the movie itself appears entirely caressed in the warm beatific glow of sunset after sunset after sunset. It makes for a pleasant enough experience--all the better for bringing out the radiant tropical blues of Zac Efrons eyes--but its narcotizing too because the drama spare under any circumstances gets glossed over in kind. Much as its half-tragic/half-whimsical story suggests themes about grief loss and the meaning of life the film is memorable mainly for attractive people sailing and smooching against an attractive backdrop. Theres no urgency behind all the preening. Based on Ben Sherwoods novel The Death And Life Of Charlie St. Cloud the film stars Efron as a sailing prodigy from the humble side of town where he lives with his overworked single mother (Kim Basinger) and a little brother played by Charlie Tahan who idolizes him. Efron is set to enroll at Stanford in the fall but his plans short-circuit when he gets into a car accident and his brother is killed. But he can see dead people Tahan reappears to him in a forest clearing and Efron spends the next five years meeting his brother there at the same time every day. Needless to say Efron gets a reputation in town as a bit of an eccentric but that isnt enough to deter Amanda Crew a lovely sailing enthusiast who tries to bring him out into the wider world. Its clear from the premise where Charlie St. Cloud is heading and if that wasnt enough the films tagline (""Life is for living"") underlines it twice for good measure. The film toys with the notion of whether Efron is really communicating with a ghost or his brother is just a manifestation of guilt and grief but the relationship between the two doesnt seem to have evolved much over five years. Either they play ball together or Tahan whines about his brother losing interest in him. Efron and Crew have better chemistry together but even then its mostly because they seem like two friendly good-looking people whod make sense sailing the globe together.

Diyah Pera Charlie Tahan (left) and Zac Efron in ""Charlie St. Cloud"" (Universal Pictures) A few years ago Burr Steers wrote and directed ""Igby Goes Down"" a bittersweet indie about a prep-school dropout that admiring critics labeled ""Salingeresque."" Then like Holden Caulfields brother D.B. Steers moved out to Hollywood where hes now made a tearjerker called ""Charlie St. Cloud"" that deserves to be labeled ""Sparksian"" -- as in Nicholas Sparks the bestselling author of ""Message in a Bottle.""The message in this bottle is ""S.O.S."" for ""Shame on Steers"" as hes potentially sunk his own career and that of the miscast Zac Efron.Efron the energetic star of the three ""High School Musical"" productions was suitable in Steers lightweight body-switch comedy ""17 Again."" Here Efron is the title character a sailboat racer in coastal Washington who is traumatized by the death of his little brother Sam (Charlie Tahan). Five years after the accident mournful Charlie is the caretaker of the cemetery and adjourns every evening to a cove where he tosses a baseball with Sams ridiculously down-to-earth ghost.But then Charlies pinkie promise to his brother gets tested by Tess (Amanda Crew). Shes a former high school classmate of Charlie and she tries to lure the haunted hunk from his fortress of solitude before she embarks on a round-the-world sailing trip. While Tess is out preparing her boat a storm hits and Charlie has to break his sacred appointment with Sam in order to search for her. ""Charlie St. Cloud"" from a novel by Ben Sherwood flirts with the mysticism of ""The Sixth Sense"" but its more like a shelved episode of ""Touched by An Angel."" The sappy script is a disservice to the naturally effervescent Efron whose character is so mopey he makes Robert Pattinson seem like a song-and-dance man. (Theres even a joyless love scene in a foggy graveyard.) So how will Efron weather a capsizing career? Reportedly hes clutching a screenplay by the actual Nicholas Sparks.S.O.S. -- same old story. PG-13  145  Contains mature language and some sensuality Favorite high school boyfriends of screen and stage Maybe you loved Lloyd Dobler or Jim Stark or a more recently crowned heartthrob.

Without question hes got It that indefinable onscreen charisma that presence you cant look away from. Does he have a long and varied career as an actor ahead of him? Sure... and yes he can act -- hes got more than just that distractingly pretty face to his credit. But Hollywood doesnt have a lot of options for him while hes stuck in the postadolescent not-quite-grownup phase. Until he matures a little more into a romantic comedy leading man or an angsty law-enforcement type (and the latter might be a stretch no matter his age) his options at this point are college sex comedy torture porn horror... and thats about it unless someone can convince him that High School Musical Post Grad is a good idea. And I hope they cant. So it makes Charlie St. Cloud somewhat less tedious than it might otherwise have been Its kinda fun to bear witness to the birth of a future movie star and Efron is an appealingly morose delight to watch here as a young man trying to find his bearings in life in the face of some tough choices that no young person should have to make. Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down) previously directed Efron in 17 Again with the end result being that his charming young star was the only reason to check out that otherwise throwaway flick. But this romantic melodrama geared for precisely the uncomfortable age Efron (Me and Orson Welles Hairspray) is at has a bit more to offer as well. There arent a lot of movies like this only the Twilight flicks come close and they come laden with a lot more histrionics and with characters its hard to like or even to accept as plausible. Not because theyre vampires or werewolves but because they do not ring true emotionally. Charlie on the other hand... even though Charlie St. Cloud -- based on the novel The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud by Ben Sherwood [Amazon U.S.] [Amazon Canada] [Amazon U.K.] -- made me roll my eyes more than once I found it impossible not to fall in love with Charlie St. Cloud. Because he is genuinely compassionate genuinely hurting and genuinely endearing. And thats all because Efron has real soul onscreen. There is a touch of the fantastical about Charlie too and about Charlie. See five years ago just after high school graduation Efrons Charlie -- poor but happy in the Pacific Northwest -- was about to head to Stanford on a sailing scholarship. But then his little brother 10-year-old Sam (Charlie Tahan I Am Legend) was killed in a car accident... an accident in which Charlie was driving. Though the smashup wasnt his fault and he couldnt have prevented it Charlie is naturally haunted by guilt... and also by the ghost of Sam himself unaged of course whom Charlie now meets every day at sunset for a game of catch. Charlie didnt go to Stanford has never even left town -- he cant you see because he promised Sam hed be there every day at sunset. Now he works a menial groundskeepers job at the local cemetery the townie girls deem him cute but unacceptably weird and his life is on hold while he pays daily homage to Sams memory and daily penance for his own remorse. And then Charlie meets Tess (Amanda Crew The Haunting in Connecticut Final Destination 3) a spirited adventurous gal -- so unlike Twilights pathologically vapid Bella Swan -- and she entices him as much as she threatens his trapped complacency. Their romance though it is perforce wrapped up Charlies melodrama is also genuine one that neither denies youthful sexuality nor wraps it in squeamish prudishness. And it doesnt play out in any expected way. Now dont mistake me Charlie St. Cloud is not a great film. Absent Efrons ingratiating performance its passably good at best. Its overly earnest and weighed down by an overweening score that wants to drive you toward particular sentiments that we dont need that overweening score to feel. But in the end theres something very moving about Charlies plight and in the poignancy of deciding whether or not to let go of the memories of those we love. Its a bit of slog getting to that ending yes but along the way the film is is also at least honest and sincere and old-fashioned in a sweet sort of way as romantic melodramas go.

Patrick Speaking of something better-than-""Twilight"" MaryAnn have you ever seen the episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" titled ""Fool For Love""? That single episode blows the whole ""Twilight"" saga out of the murky water. Its definitely worth a watch. Matt C The movie looks all right certainly better than 90% of the other chick flicks out there. Im probably one of the few guys who doesnt loathe Efron -- he does have It but he probably needs to pick his projects more closely. And hes done voice work on ""Robot Chicken"" which is one of the funniest shows on Adult Swim. (If you havent seen RC I suggest you Netflix/DVR it.) Hes definitely more than just some Teen Idol with a Pretty Face. MaryAnn i take great exception to the notion that male critics are being ""brutally harsh"" because this is a movie catering to women. just because im a girl i shouldnt expect DECENT films whether they be chick flicks or not? I agree that we should not expect movies for women to be bad. I did not grade this film on that kind of curve (and to be fair there are some male critics who were tentatively positive toward this film and there are some female critics who were brutally harsh). extremely upset that i wasted 9 bucks to watch this.

Faithfully retaining the maudlin contrivance (if not the plot particulars) of Ben Sherwoods 2004 novel ""Charlie St. Cloud"" is a ""Lovely Bones Lite"" sentimental fantasy with Zac Efron in active contact with deceased loved ones. Auds for this kind of inspirational tearjerker usually skew older so Efron and director Burr Steers may find fewer takers than they did for last years more comedic fantasy ""17 Again."" Religious overtones however could make this the rare mainstream feature that connects with the faith-based entertainment market. Eighteen-year-old Charlie (Efron) and kid brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) have been raised in a quaint coastal town by their working-class single mom (Kim Basinger). When the boys are involved in a car crash only Charlie survives. Keeping a promise never to separate Sam shows up as a very flesh-and-blood ghost -- albeit one only Charlie can see -- to play catch every day at dusk in the forest near his final resting place. In order to keep that daily date Charlie puts college plans on perma-hold and becomes the cemeterys caretaker. He mostly keeps to himself but does spark with Tess (Amanda Crew) whom hed regularly beaten in sailing competitions during high school but who is now prepping for a solo around-the-world race. When Tess shows up disheveled in the graveyard one day their tentative romance advances a few steps. But then it emerges that Tess was last seen sailing into a storm and may be lost at sea. Is she another ghost Charlie can see (and touch and then some) because hed briefly ""crossed over"" for a few minutes after his accident before being revived by a prayerful paramedic (Ray Liotta)? As book and film ""Charlie St. Cloud"" is spiritual comfort food that suggests the dead never leave us -- in even more literal terms than in ""The Lovely Bones"" -- and that love for ones family or mate can be so special it will transcend or at least bend the usual gulfs between life and death. Surviving page-to-screen is the tomes first sentence ""I believe in miracles"" as well as a homily-prone sentimentality. Scenarists Craig Pearce and Lewis Colick considerably alter some of the novels elements while maintaining its overall gist. Most notably Charlie is no longer first met as a 15-year-old nonsailor but as a high school graduate with a ""sailing scholarship to Stanford."" The storys timespan is compressed from 13 to five years and theres an action-cliffhanger climax. (Setting has also been changed from Marblehead Mass. to fictive Quincy Harbor shot in picturesque but cheaper British Columbia locations.) Not missed are Sherwoods gushing character descriptions (""He was the most perfect man she had ever touched"" etc.) or his penchant for telling readers exactly what to think and feel at every juncture. Some changes are less felicitous such as making the brothers cockier their dynamic more bratty than tender. As a result juve thesp Tahan (""I Am Legend"") quickly grows irksome. Other perfs are just OK. Photographed and dressed (or occasionally undressed) for maximum swoonage Efron holds the screen but hasnt yet demonstrated depth beyond facile charm and junior hunkitude. The novels older protag is bowed by grief and guilt; pic reshuffles the deck to support thesps more callow range of emotion. Those easily moved will sniffle as cued; anyone else is likely to remain dry-eyed. Though the narrative cant help but inspire some eye-rolling director Steers does avoid some potential bathos via brisk pacing and glossy packaging.

TWITTER ""Charlie St. Cloud"" from director Burr Steers is the latest to portray everlasting love on the screen and the film doesnt just fail it actually gets sillier by the minute. Every now and then a brave filmmaker cant resist the temptation of making a metaphysical film that somehow will manage to portray everlasting love on the screen that will somehow show a romantic idealism so great that it transcends even the boundaries between the living and dead. This is a temptation filmmakers need seriously to resist. ""Charlie St. Cloud"" from director Burr Steers who made the estimable ""Igby Goes Down"" is the latest to take on this foolhardy task and the film doesnt just fail it actually gets sillier by the minute. There is little worse in movies than earnestness hitched to the wrong project. Media notes claim the source material a novel by Ben Sherwood received sufficient acclaim to get translated into 15 languages so perhaps there are enough worldwide romantics to create a modest cult following around ""Charlie."" It happened with ""Somewhere in Time"" (1980) and ""What Dreams May Come"" (1998) admittedly much different kinds of movies and much grander in their pretensions and earnestness. But the guess is that ""Charlie"" more modest but therefore less cult-ready doesnt stand a chance. One problem -- there are many but lets focus on this -- is that the metaphysical rules keep changing. Charlie St. Cloud (Zac Efron) is a small-town sailing hero of whom great things are expected. But he loses all ambition after a car accident that he ""miraculously"" survives but kills his kid brother Sam (Charlie Tahan). Afterward to quote from another film Charlie sees dead people. Or does he? For the next five years he plays catch with Sam every evening at sunset in the woods near the cemetery. He chats with a high school buddy killed as a marine in the Middle East near his gravestone. Then later in the film he sees another dead person who well ... turns out isnt really dead. So are these spectral appearances real or dreams? Only writers Craig Pearce and Lewis Colick know for sure. Charlies obsessive love for his late brother has caused him to turn down a college scholarship and take a job as live-in caretaker at the cemetery. He seemingly has no friends other than a fellow groundskeeper (Augustus Prew) but the film treats this oddness as nothing more than someone marching to the (up)beat of a different drummer. When Charlie and Sam play in a rainstorm Rolfe Kents music cheers them on and the editing of this montage is snappy and happy. Silly comedy is made of Charlie and his cemetery mate trying unsuccessfully to chase away the geese that inhabit the grounds but make their jobs more difficult. Charlie even meets a cute girl tending her fathers grave. Isnt life just peachy here in the cemetery? In other words there is nothing weird or creepy about a guy obsessed with a dead brother. Any more than there is when the paramedic (Ray Liotta) who rescued and miraculously revived Charlie suddenly reappears in his life with terminal cancer and the message that Charlie was saved for ""a reason."" Speaking of sudden reappearances a former high school classmate named Tess (Amanda Crew) abruptly appears on Charlies radar. Where has she been for five years? Nevermind she is the one person in this small seacoast town presumably Oregon but really British Columbia who doesnt think Charlie is a nut job. Must be because she is a fellow sailor. Indeed she is about to embark on a major international solo race. Despite her departure in a week Charlie is torn between Sam the Dead and Tess the Living. Things do get sillier but to explain would involve spoilers. Lets just say that the last movie character who had storms and atmospheric electrical charges to guide him to his destiny was played by Charlton Heston. Efron plays Charlie as your average young movie-star hunk. He takes off his shirt frequently but looks ungainly and stilted in his beefcake poses. Tahan and Crew are much more natural though the same cant be said for Liotta and Kim Basinger in the thankless role of Charlies mostly offscreen mother. Credits in this Universal-produced movie are studio-slick but the film cries out for a grungy Sundance look that would indicate something weird is going on. Otherwise this is a labor-intensive and seriously ill-conceived way to win a girls heart.

Such a contagion is Charlie St. Cloud a load of mawkish swill starring Zac Efron (bereft of the talent he showed in Me and Orson Welles). As Charlie Efron plays catch every day at sunset with his younger brother Sam (Charlie Tahan). The problem? Sam died in a car accident. Director Burr Steers who guided Efron through the witless 17 Again bathes this mush in golden light. But you cant shine a turd. Charlie falls in love with a pretty sailor (Amanda Crew).

"Charlie St. Cloud a weeper but not a keeper - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 1 1/2 starsCharlie St. Cloud a weeper but not a keeperJuly 29 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticCharlie Tahan and Zac Efron in ""Charlie St. Cloud.""1 1/2 stars The Motion Picture Association of America has given ""Charlie St. Cloud"" a PG-13 rating for among other things ""an intense accident scene"" which is the best way to describe the film itself. With some supernatural melodramas you may buy whats on the page as with ""The Lovely Bones"" or ""The Time Travelers Wife."" Throw an ill-starred film adaptation at the same fantastic conceits however and they deflate faster than you can say ""phffffft"" or ""whoops"" followed by ""wha happened?"" Ben Sherwoods novel ""The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud"" adapted here by Craig Pearce and Lewis Colick tells the tale of a college-bound working-class sailing phenom whose brother Sam 11 is killed by a drunk driver. Charlies life derails; he cancels plans to attend Stanford on scholarship to become a hermit-like groundskeeper at the cemetery where Sam is buried. Strange things happen there. Charlie thinks he sees Sam behind a gravestone. Then one day looking quite hale Sam shows up with his baseball glove and ball in hand. A bargain is struck Every day at sundown the brothers will throw the ball around talk about the things that matter work on their grounders. But Charlie (and this is all Im saying about it) has special powers and he communes with more than one spirit. When his onetime sailing competitor Tess ( Amanda Crew) starts gumming up the works romantically speaking Charlie confronts a host of tough questions. Among them How many different ways are there to cry? Zac Efron who sloshes his way through the role of Charlie tries them all and succeeds well enough though ""Charlie St. Cloud"" might have gotten by with a more charismatic cast. Charlie Tahans Sam fares best; hes direct emotionally straightforward and he doesnt beg for our sympathy even when everyone else works overtime at it. The storys icky frankly. (Warning A wee spoiler follows.) At a key juncture Charlie and Tess get together in the cemetery for something nobody ever does in the ""Twilight"" series and then we learn its not happening at least not the way we think it is because she has suffered a horrible sailing accident. And needs rescuing. By someone preferably shirtless. And someone ready to let go of his grief which means letting go of the metaphor for that grief the kid with the glove. Live your life. Live it to the fullest. These are the worthy sentiments of ""Charlie St. Cloud."" Director Burr Steers milks them dry like an overeager farmer at milking time which is a paradox since this is the wettest picture of 2010 what with the sea spray and Efrons tear ducts and the general metaphysical mist. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for language including some sexual references an intense accident scene and some sensuality) Cast Zac Efron (Charlie St. Cloud); Amanda Crew (Tess); Donal Logue (Tink); Charlie Tahan (Sam); Ray Liotta (Florio); Kim Basinger (Claire) Credits Directed by Burr Steers; written by Craig Pearce and Lewis Colick based on the novel ""The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud"" by Ben Sherwood; produced by Marc Platt.

Charlie St. Cloud Director Burr Steers. Cast Zac Efron Charlie Tahan Amanda Crew Kim Basinger Ray Liotta. Rating PG-13 for language including some sexual references an intense accident scene and some sensuality. Exclusive Qamp;A with Zac Efron | Visits Phoenix Spotlight Kim Basinger | Baseball movies Ghost stories | Brothers in movies Check Charlie St. Cloud showtimes In ""Charlie St. Cloud"" the teen dreamboat from ""High School Musical"" takes on his first adult role playing a young man who gives up a bright future to keep his promise to practice baseball every sunset with the ghost of his kid brother. Guilt grief and the struggle to move on are big themes but unfortunately director Burr Steers and his script writers arent interested in exploring them. The films tagline ""Life is for living"" is about as deep as it gets. Instead Ben Sherwoods 2004 novel ""The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud"" is stripped to its barest plot points to emphasize Charlies romance with Tess (Amanda Crew) a fetching young yachtswoman who might threaten his devotion to his dead brother. There are plenty of picturesque sailing shots not to mention close-ups of Efron usually either shirtless or weeping beatifically a la Demi Moore. But the characters and their supernatural love triangle are developed with a businesslike efficiency that makes it almost impossible to invest in them emotionally. If youve read a one-sentence synopsis of ""Charlie St. Cloud"" it will take an hour or so before anything remotely surprising happens. And if you watched the trailers it will take even longer. My advice Read the book instead. Or if you simply like looking at Zac Efron buy his calendar. Reach the reporter at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com.

As the title golden boy of Charlie St. Cloud Efron plays a small-town competitive sailor whose beloved little brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) gets killed in a car crash. (Charlie was at the wheel.) It doesnt take long to figure out that Charlie dies too -- at least in spirit. Instead of heading off to Stanford to realize his dream of becoming a sailing champion he stays home going to work at the local graveyard. Hes so ruled by guilt and despair that he imagines hes talking to ghosts -- like that of his late brother whom he ""keeps alive"" by meeting him every day at the exact same clearing in the woods to play baseball. The surreal thing is Zac Efron cant do despair. He plays it by staring. Blankly. And by not smiling. Blankly. Those sky blue eyes of his may be moody but in Charlie St. Cloud they have only one mood -- a fake-profound lost-idol tranquillity. Instead of making you weep he puts you in a coma. Charlie St. Cloud is as wholesome as a Miley Cyrus movie only without the energy. Its like the religio-kitsch version of a TV tragedy-of-the-week. Charlie starts to hang out with a girl tailor-made for him (Amanda Crew whos like a text-generation Anne Hathaway) but he cant be with her until he lets go of the past and says goodbye to his ghosts. Efron you can tell is trying to get beyond his past but one or two more movies like this one and High School Musical 4 will be beckoning.

But wait...is that a drunk driver there in the distance barreling toward baby brother Sam (Tahan)? Suffice to say that Charlies dreams are shattered in an instant. Suddenly this toothily grinning extrovert becomes a brooding (but still perfectly groomed) recluse working as caretaker for the local cemetery. His days are consumed by chasing a flock of shit-happy ducks his evenings devoted to playing catch with Sam since Charlie can now talk to the dead. Cue those weepy violins. Indeed you get everything youd expect from this mostly saccharine melodrama Hallmark aphorisms picturesque locales a St. Jude--stumping paramedic (Liotta). Yet it feels as if director Burr Steers is trying to cast a more complicated eye on things to the point that Charlies otherworldly encounters waffle between seeming divine and delusional. And one scene--a nighttime idyll between Charlie and his soulmate-of-a-sort Tess (Crew)--is like Mizoguchi gone tween. Shallow homilies ultimately dominate but theres a deeper movie trying to get out from behind the greeting card.--Keith Uhlich More new Film reviews Posted Monday July 26 2010 Details Release details Cast and crew Users say LiveReviews|0NaN people listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew ReviewsRefreshShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map },http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/film/87633/charliestcloud,200,charliest.cloud28,charliest.cloud,timeout

Half a decade later Charlie has sunk into a shy brooding routine as a cemetery caretaker and meets his dead bro in the woods every sunset to toss around a baseball. Adapted from a 2005 novel by Ben Sherwood this blatant heartstring-puller from director Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down) is more sentimental than subtle in depicting a grieving young man whos been stunted by his inability to let go. But even at its most maudlin (enter Ray Liotta as the St. Jude-praying cancer-ridden paramedic who revived Charlie and has suddenly reconnected with him) this handsomely shot melodrama has a twist too peculiar to dismiss as some two-bit Nicholas Sparks weepie.
