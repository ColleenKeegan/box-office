But theres always a catch and in this case its Cyrus (Jonah Hill) Mollys live-at-home twentysomething son whose Oedipal intimacy with his oblivious mum puts a spanner in Johns romantic dreams.Enormous respect is due to directors Mark and Jay Duplass whose transition to Hollywood hasnt compromised their singular filmmaking style even a fraction. The result is as warm and wise as the brothers homemade debut The Puffy Chair while retaining their commitment to sly genre subversion which began with disassembled horror pastiche Baghead. Cyrus can be viewed as just an effective and intimate romantic comedy albeit with a pitch-dark edge of discomfort stemming largely from Hills chilling revelatory performance. But its also  a witty reflection on Hollywoods traditional ideas of romance and family particularly among characters of a certain age simply by treating these characters as real with all the uncertainty emotional baggage and bad decisions that entails the Duplasses expertly expose the hypocrisy of the airbrushed all-American ideal.

A misleading trailer and a painfully drawn out film. Unoriginal boring and totally without any redeeming features except for the efforts the cast make to compensate for the absence of a script. Mumblecore should retain its low budget obscurity and stay away from any mainstream film. This absurd trend of improvisation just creates another style of acting which contrary to the film-makers expectations is not at all natural. There were some nice parts to this film but unfortunately they were islands in a sea of utter mind-numbing dross. I stuck it out to the end solely to see what sort of resolution it had and was almost comatose by the time the credits began. I would have been happy to leave this film to the romantics and Mumblecore die-hards had it not been for the totally misleading advertising. Dreary Im afraid.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 13 2010RussellFeaturedPlease dont go to this film like I did...expecting a comedy or else you will pretty much be disappointed having said that if you go expecting a nicely observed nuanced and warm hearted film which is well cast and is modest in its aims youll probably be delighted. I liked the leads and Jonah Hill does as much as can be done with his part but the plot is a little illogical at times and the end is almost right but veers off somewhere before it gets there.

Reilly begins dating a woman (Marisa Tomei) with a strangely intimate relationship with her grown son (Jonah Hill). Starring Marisa Tomei Catherine Keener Jonah Hill John C. Reilly Katie Aselton Matt Walsh Tim Guinee Jamie Donnelly Kellan Rhude Steve Zissis Director Jay Duplass Mark Duplass Running time 132 Release Opened Jul 9 2010  Editorial Review A close look at ties that bindBy Ann HornadayFriday June 25 2010Brothers Jay and Mark Duplass are best known to those who know of them at all as the writing-directing team that helped create the ""mumblecore"" genre notable for its shambling improvised narrative structures and youthful esprit de corps. With ""Cyrus"" the brothers third feature they show newfound ambition -- the movie features such name actors as Jonah Hill Marisa Tomei and John C. Reilly -- but also an adamant refusal to overreach. ""Cyrus"" a comedy designed to elicit reflection rather than outright laughs keeps its focus uncomfortable and obsessive just the way the movies neurotic protagonists like it.The movie announces its confrontational intentions from the get-go when in the opening scene the films hero John (Reilly) is interrupted in an intimate moment by ex-wife Jamie (Catherine Keener) who has stopped by his house to let him know shes getting remarried. Later at a party Jamie persuades him to attend John meets Molly (Tomei) a knockout who thinks his penchant for drunken confessions and public urination is kind of cute. The future looks bright for John and Molly until he discovers that she has been hiding something.That would be the title character Mollys 21-year-old son played here by Hill in a creepy funny sad weirdly unsettling performance. A sedentary mountain of an adolescently arrested man-child Cyrus lives in a deeply enmeshed relationship with his devoted mother who has home-schooled him and now encourages his techno-emo noodlings on a gaggle of synthesizer keyboards. When John first gets a load of Cyrus his face reflects the very questions that surely come up for the audience Is this kid a gifted if troubled genius? Or is there something darker at the core of his devotion to his mom?Then again John has his own boundary issues as his still-close friendship with Jamie suggests. The Duplass brothers are perfectly happy to keep viewers off balance throughout ""Cyrus"" which they structure mostly as scenes of people telling each other how they feel what they think and what theyre observing.Thanks to terrific performances especially from Reilly as the audiences befuddled surrogate these encounters dont play like pseudo-therapy but like vignettes from life with its absurdities and ambiguities vexingly intact. And the Duplasses are as generous with their payoff as they are canny about building up suspense. Even at its most troubling ""Cyrus"" is powered by a deep vein of humanism one that offers hope to even the weirdest among us.Contains profanity and sexual material.

Reilly in ""Cyrus"" Cyrus Cyrus is a comedy that may make you squirm BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Jul 2 2010 (...) Fox Searchlight Pictures From left Jonah Hill Marisa Tomei and John C. Reilly in ""Cyrus"" Consumer alert In contemporary comedy theres funny haha and theres ""Funny Haha.""""Cyrus"" cast members John C. Reilly (""Talladega Nights"") and Jonah Hill (""Superbad"") specialize in the former but ""Cyrus"" directors Mark and Jay Duplass (""The Puffy Chair"") are descended from the latter the earliest example of the microbudget dramedies dubbed ""mumblecore.""Like the recent ""Greenberg"" ""Cyrus"" is not the jokey polished production you would expect from its Hollywood cast and LA setting but audiences who are comfortable with discomfort should find it ""funny."" Reilly is the lumpen embodiment of discomfort as John a lonesome middle-age film editor who is still grieving his divorce from Jamie (Catherine Keener) after seven years. But when she drags him to a party and plies him with carbonated confidence he meets Molly (the irresistible Marisa Tomei). Somehow this happy doll finds his woefulness endearing and she spends the night with him. When Molly scurries home in the middle of the night John assumes its because this too-good-to-be-true woman is married. But when he follows her home he discovers something worse Molly has a 20-ish son Cyrus (Hill) who is unusually close to his mother.Although wily Cyrus initially welcomes John into the house his friendliness hides a hostility that soon turns to competition and sabotage. The marketing of the movie might lead you to believe that ""Cyrus"" is a zany battle between witless adversaries like Reillys major-studio ""Step Brothers"" but its more like an improvised parody of John Cassavetes filmed with a camera phone.A movie with such claustrophobic visuals requires a limber cast to breathe life into it and the three leads exceed expectations in more ways than one. Hill is a particular revelation in a fully fleshed-out role and the borderline-scary story line keeps us off balance with both sweet and sour surprises. Its maybe more than some can stomach but ""Cyrus"" has the lingering taste of truthfulness.

Jonah Hill Marisa Tomei and John C. Reilly; Photo by Chuck Zlotnick. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald7/7/2010 Editor rating 3 Cyrus the first film by writer-director brothers Jay and Mark Duplass (The Puffy Chair Baghead) made with famous actors and a real budget under the auspices of a studio is a lot like their previous pictures Its a shrewd poignant drama disguised as a comedy. John (John C. Reilly) is a sad-sack neurotic who still doesnt understand his divorce from Jamie (Catherine Keener) seven years ago. Jamie is preparing to remarry but John hasnt so much as had a date in as long as he can remember. He is insecure and frets about everything so when Jamie drags him to a party and he meets Molly (Marisa Tomei) a smart attractive single mom who ends up going home with him his life suddenly takes on meaning and direction. Everythings swell until John meets Mollys 21-year-old son Cyrus (Jonah Hill) who has an unusually close bond with his mom -- hell walk into the bathroom to use the toilet while shes taking a shower -- and isnt eager to share her. At first John and Cyrus are uncomfortably polite and respectful toward each other but the tension is palpable and once John realizes that Cyrus is passive-aggressively out to sabotage his relationship the war is on. Cyrus sounds like the sort of comedy in which people end up dropping buckets of paint on each others heads but the Duplasses treat the characters and their dilemma with utmost seriousness a technique that gives the movie its uncomfortably comic vibe. Reilly proves to be quite an able romantic lead as a depressed man who just needs a little push to remind himself -- and the world -- what a great person he is. Tomei never allows Molly to seem oblivious or blind to her sons manipulations She calls him on his bad behavior whenever she needs to but you also understand how a mothers love for her only child would make her overlook certain things. The big revelation in Cyrus is Hill previously relegated to broad comedic roles (Superbad Knocked Up Funny People) who adds a shade of darkness and borderline dementia to Cyrus manipulative ways. The character is fascinating -- a son who loves his mother too much because she meets all the needs (except sexual) a regular girlfriend normally would fulfill. Cyrus and his mom are best friends play pals and roommates when they should be mother and son. Cyrus which is occasionally hilarious but never clownish keeps alive the Duplass brothers recurring theme life is funny enough without someones having to write jokes for it. Cast John C.

Reilly right is the intruder in the union between mother Marisa Tomei and son Jonah Hill in ""Cyrus.""

John C. Reilly and Marisa Tomei are dear as John and Molly. Their romance is set in motion when Johns ex-wife and seemingly only friend arrives to tell him shes getting married. Catherine Keener all dry wit and pained concern portrays Jamie the former mate who really would like to see John happy. So she and almost-patient fiance Tim (Matt Walsh) drag John to a party. Johns not handsome exactly. Mollys lovely. Hes been contorted by his divorce. Shes comfortable in her skin if a bit mysterious. Hes a mess. How much so makes for embarrassing laughs as John tries to meet a couple of ladies. Yet the vivacious Molly seems well to borrow her word ""interested."" What gives? Because there must be a rub. The answer is provided in the movies title. Jonah Hill plays Cyrus Mollys 21-year-old son who has yet to leave the nest. With his electronic-music equipment ensconced in the corner its clear hes in no hurry. Molly and Cyrus mother-and-child union has a hermetically sealed quality. John breaks the seal. A pair of shoes goes missing. Things get steadily tense. In ""Cyrus"" the comedic and dramatic accents often occur at unexpected moments. The Duplasses arent purveyors of the overly broad or the slapstick a fact that does little to stop the movie from being consistently quietly riotous. Theres intimacy in their yuks. They even maneuver the ick factor in Molly and Cyrus affection. Johns confounded expression as Cyrus enters the bathroom where Molly is showering says so much. Hes freaked in a muted sort of way. We sure are. But not having this promise of love in his life scares him more. The Duplass brothers have been building to this fine moment over the past five years. In 2005 they debuted with a winningly odd lowest-budget feature called ""The Puffy Chair."" Two summers ago their hybrid comedy-horror flick ""Baghead"" opened but didnt quite catch on. ""Cyrus"" may encourage viewers to rent the pleasantly ""meta"" flick about friends who go to a cabin to write a script (possibly horror theyre not sure) only to become the targets of a masked intruder. ""Cyrus"" is a leaps-and-bounds achievement. Funny-intelligent it unfolds on its own terms in the brothers budding aesthetic. Cinematographer Jas Shelton appears at times to be deciding in a scene between a close-up or midrange shot. Its rough-hewn but intentional. It resembles a documentary approach where things are caught and discovered not created. Still its the type of shot that could alienate moviegoers were it not supported by the honest magnetism of the performances. Reilly excels at characters like John. Hes equal parts hesitation and bumbling straightforwardness. He wants to like Cyrus. He knows whats at stake if he cant. The Duplasses made a great call casting Tomei. Molly is honest about so much except perhaps her son. Of course these two men would be anxious to have and to hold her. Shes a life force a life line and yes maybe a bit of an enabler. If youve seen ""Get Him to the Greek"" -- and we recommend it for those with a high threshold for the crass -- then youll understand that Hill is not a one-note performer. Cyrus is troubling and understandable. Hes bright but also manipulative. Hill nails the feeling that the flat-affect mind-gaming Cyrus might not be quite right. What is very right is the tone of the Duplasses endearing comedy. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com. Also on blogs.denverpost.com/madmoviegoer ""CYRUS.

No one answers. We hear music playing from inside. She calls out; still no one answers. She lets herself in and starts walking through the seemingly empty house the twitchy handheld camera following her peering over her shoulder as she walks down a dark hallway toward a closed door. Movie Information CyrusRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirectors Jay and Mark DuplassStarring John C. Reilly Marisa Tomei Jonah Hill and Catherine KeenerRun time 92 minutesMPAA rating R (language and some sexual material)Synopsis John C. Reilly cant believe his luck when he meets the woman of his dreams (Marisa Tomei). Too bad her son already has her wrapped up.More movies from GuideLive.comThis could be the opening for a horror film and in a way it is because what happens next is horrifying. It is also hilarious and thus viewers are introduced to the Cyrus experience a movie that melds creepy and comic so seamlessly that almost every laugh is undercut by a cringe. Thats a tricky balance to strike in a way that doesnt veer into slapstick. In the hands of indie filmmakers Jay and Mark Duplass who wrote and directed Cyrus is something like anti-slapstick - calm steady deliberate.Thats not a typical description for a comedy but Cyrus isnt your typical comedy. Im not even sure it is a comedy. At the very least it isnt one by conventional terms despite its quintessential Hollywood comedy premise Lonely man John (John C. Reilly) falls in love with perfect woman Molly (Marisa Tomei) but is sabotaged at every turn by her master-manipulator son Cyrus (Jonah Hill).An effective way of summarizing the sophisticated charms of this movie is to imagine what it would have been like if it were directed by Judd Apatow or one of his acolytes. It would be wall-to-wall frantic antics. The characters wouldnt talk so much as jabber with lots of maddening miscommunication leading to improbable but hilarious high jinks. It might be funny but it would never feel real and inevitably it would dissolve into a soft-squishy happy-hopeful ending.Cyrus always feels absolutely and dead-on real. People in this film talk the way people talk in life. That may not be quite right They talk the way people sometimes talk when they let their guard down (or have their guard way way up). The result is that the dynamic among the trio of John-Molly-Cyrus always feels and sounds life-size and human-scale. John can be the witty life of the party; Molly can be Ms. Got It Going On; and Cyrus can be the effortless charmer. That is most assuredly not who they are. Mostly what they are is scared and scarred.Split credit for this quality between the Duplass screenplay and the ensembles acting. The Duplass brothers are meticulous observers of everyday moments and exchanges. What some critics have labeled laziness or lack of ambition in their style comes across here as having the confidence to let meanings and implications reverberate under the surface rather than beat the audience over the head with them. This restraint allows the movie to engage all kinds of explosive themes - did someone say incest? - without being overwhelmed by them.The acting meanwhile is a joy to watch. The three leads put on a clinic and Catherine Keener is once again irresistibly normal as Johns heroically tolerant ex-wife. John C. Reilly delivers a series of soul-baring soliloquies that are all the more powerful for how spontaneous and unforced they seem (a quality fed by the improve and rough-outline approach the Duplass brothers apply to their writing and filmmaking). And it may be time to declare Marisa Tomei a national treasure; her Molly is smart funny sexy and beautiful - is it any wonder Cyrus doesnt want to share her and knows hell never do better?Still somehow Jonah Hills Cyrus is the indisputable star. Its no secret that hes wickedly funny but now we know He can really act with a face that can go from puppy-dog to psycho-killer in the blink of a crazy crazy eye. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Cyrus Good Directors Mark and Jay Duplass. Cast John C. Reilly Jonah Hill Marisa Tomei. Rating R for language and some sexual material. Note At Harkins Camelview. RELATED Mumble no more The Duplass brothers move on with Cyrus Spotlight John C. Reilly Playing the 21-year-old title character still living at home with his mother with whom he is close to what at times seems an uncomfortable degree Hill goes from sweet and funny to dark disturbed and at times almost dangerous. But which is it really? Its a great performance. Although Hill certainly has been good in previous roles this goes beyond what weve seen. ""Cyrus"" begins as a tale of woe with John (John C. Reilly) at the tail end of a downward spiral that has lasted awhile. Hes still friendly with his ex-wife Jamie (Catherine Keener) whos getting remarried. She invites him to a party where he meets Molly (Marisa Tomei) in rather unusual fashion; public urination as a pickup move isnt something you see every day and thats probably a good thing. John likes Molly and she seems to like him though they both have the distinct aura of damaged goods about them. John in particular is desperate for happiness; when he basically stalks Molly he finds that her son Cyrus still lives with her. Overweight shy and seemingly sweet Cyrus appears to center his world on his mother and the bank of synthesizers on which he plays his original compositions. As John and Molly grow closer Cyrus initially friendly toward John grows more difficult. It is in some ways the classic story of the child resenting his single mothers interest in another man. In other ways its creepy. Hill manages to get both aspects of a complicated set of relationships just right. The acting is in fact uniformly outstanding. Reilly gives John at first a sense of amused befuddlement - how did his shoes go missing exactly? He doesnt want to appear paranoid but he doesnt want to blow it with Molly either. Tomeis role is trickier; she must make Mollys obviously genuine love for her son play more as a desire not to disappoint him than something darker. Shes just spoiling him. Right? Whats more the actors play off each other with an assured ease even as things get increasingly uncomfortable. John having basically checked out of human relationships for a time doesnt always realize when hes revealing too much but he errs on the side of good intentions. Cyrus an expert at revealing only what he intends to emotionally has no trouble taking advantage of this. Dinner conversations can be exquisitely uncomfortable. The inevitable showdowns between John and Cyrus meanwhile are hilarious. The film is written and directed by Mark and Jay Duplass former proponents of the ""mumblecore"" movement low-budget films in which young people typically aimless live their unhurried lives - slacker as mission statement. Their previous films such as ""The Puffy Chair"" and ""Baghead"" were well-received but ""Cyrus"" is a bold step forward. Its ambitious in terms of emotion rather than action. These are curious people living lives that if not immediately recognizable seem no less genuine and believable. And then theres Hill. It turns out that the regular-guy sensibility he brought to what could have been a one-note character in ""Get Him to the Greek"" was just the beginning of what he can do.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 97594144 Review ""Cyrus"" is a relationship comedy-drama with nuance An indie feature by the Duplass brothers dares to be complicated and succeeds. By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune July 1 2010 -- 159pm Fox Searchlight Dml - Marisa Tomei and John C. Reilly in ""Cyrus"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Like circus plate-spinners indie moviemaking siblings Jay and Mark Duplass keep several levels of emotions aloft at once. The writer/directors recognize that most of us are a whole lot of different people clamoring for attention from inside the same skin. Their characters are often ill at ease hopeful laughable touching confident and clueless all at once. Which makes their nuanced movies challenging to market and oh-so-rewarding to watch. In the relationship comedy-drama ""Cyrus"" they shake up the typical dynamics of a romantic triangle with a jolt of weird Oedipal tension and notes of genuine emotional vulnerability. John C. Reilly plays John a sad-sack L.A. film editor seven years divorced from Jamie (Catherine Keener). She has moved on building a successful career and finding a nice guy shes about to marry. John not handsome or prosperous enough to beat the local competition is on the verge of withdrawing from social life entirely. Jamie invites John to a house party where his attempts to chat up ladies become a strikeout marathon. Boozing the pain away he relieves himself in the bushes beside the pool where he meets Molly (Marisa Tomei). She teases him they banter and he fuzzily inquires ""Are you flirting with me? Thats insane. Im like Shrek. What are you doing in the forest with Shrek?"" Back inside he launches into a raucous sing-along to Human Leagues ""Dont You Want Me"" (""Best song ever"" he fist-pumps) awkwardly solo until Molly joins in on the chorus. Soon theyre making sweet music together but she is guarded about her home life. Spying on her in near-stalkerish fashion John discovers Mollys secret Cyrus (Jonah Hill) her 21-year-old live-at-home son. Hes more than normally protective of his doting mother who home-schooled him kisses him continually and lets him sleep with their bedroom doors open in case he has bad dreams. Cyrus becomes Johns nightmare as he clandestinely tries to undermine his romance with Molly. Mother vs. love interest CYRUS  1/2 OUT OF FOUR STARS  RATING R FOR LANGUAGE AND SOME SEXUAL MATERIAL.  WHERE LAGOON. Johns dawning realization that Cyrus is sabotaging him is a wonder to behold. The light of understanding in his eyes rises like a bulb on a rheostat. So does his vexation; Molly who has coddled the boy since birth doesnt register that she has created a sneaky passive-aggressive monster hell-bent on destroying her potential happiness. The battle for Mollys heart becomes open warfare with neither of the men in her life able to score a knockout. The byplay between Reilly and Hill is sublime. In their first scene together Cyrus plays one of his keyboard-and-beatbox compositions for John. The music goes from cliched new age Yanni drivel to cliched hard-core techno in 30 seconds flat. John tries to find an appropriate expression of approval as Cyrus zaps him with laser death eyes. Their sparring becomes more painful scene by scene and Tomeis Molly is completely sympathetic as she tiptoes through the minefield of her new relationships with her suitor and son. Shes not thrilled to be seen as the spoils in a conflict between an adult man-child and a junior edition. What the Duplass brothers learned in their micro-budget early features (""The Puffy Chair"" and ""Baghead"") are the essential skills of timing editing and character development. In their first studio feature they are mercifully evenhanded in their treatment of the characters. One feels sympathetic to both rivals and as their conflict escalates one doesnt know whether to laugh sadistically or groan in sympathy. I opted for a compromise laughing out loud then feeling a little ashamed. And then laughing some more.

Movie Review Cyrus An interesting but creepy threesome Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 25 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Cyrus Directed and written by Jay and Mark Duplass Starring John C. Reilly Marisa Tomei Jonah Hill Classification 14A Part black comedy part romantic drama Cyrus is a love triangle with some very oblique angles. The emotional geometry is familiar enough to be credible yet odd enough to be creepy and when the movie is working - through about half of its length - that volatile mix keeps us off-balance and engaged wondering how or if the complications will resolve themselves. Then comes the final-act test and a disappointing grade. The questions here are good; its the answers that feel like a cheat. Since their feature debut in The Puffy Chair the Duplass siblings Jay and Mark have built their indie reputation on the merits of quirkiness - quirky title quirky characters quirky shooting techniques quirky improvising on a loose script. This time stepping up in budgetary class theyve assembled a bigger-name cast all eminently capable of handling and even enhancing the brothers loosey-goosey ways. The performances are terrific beginning with John C. Reilly who plays our point man in the triangle a narrative guide through these strange domestic doings. His perspective is the audiences and were grateful for the company. Although John (Reilly) is long-divorced from his ex-wife Jamie (Catherine Keener) they remain on amicable terms - he out of lonely need she out of residual guilt for dumping him. These days the guy is gainfully employed yet otherwise dysfunctional a sad sack whos overweight and under-confident. Encouraged by Jamie to try his luck at a party he strikes out with every girl in the room. Except one. The lovely Molly (Marisa Tomei) is unaccountably attracted to him and when they end up in bed he cant help but blurt out ""What are you doing with me? Im like Shrek."" We soon find out. A single mom Molly has a mini-Shrek still living under her roof. Enter chubby Cyrus (Jonah Hill) her ""almost 22-year-old"" boy. Enter too a mother/son relationship so emotionally co-dependent that it borders on the incestuous. He calls her ""Molly"" and casually strolls into the bathroom while shes singing in the shower. No big deal - they just finish the song in harmony. Showing off acting chops beyond his usual comedic range Hill gives the man-child a darkly manipulative edge. Always cordial ostensibly grown-up yet deeply narcissistic Cyrus is a master of passive-aggressive tactics - his mother is the one love in his life and he wants her to himself. As the outsider eager to join in John like us wonders what to make of this exercise in mutual neediness. Its obviously not quite normal yet it may still be innocent Just how far into abnormal territory have they ventured? Smitten with Molly he wants to believe the best and so these feeling-out scenes have an intriguing subtextual tension. On the surface everything is calm but beneath suspicions abound between John and Cyrus. The two geeks are awkward antagonists in an awkward situation vying for the same woman although playing by different rules The man is obliged to be mature; the man-child isnt. This is amusing and disturbing in like measure humour with a distinctly black tint. But then the rivals drop the polite facade and the repressed tension goes overt. Thats when the funny business stops and the tedium sets in. Thats also when needing to impose a resolution the film decides its a straight-up comedy and starts to become as falsely manipulative as Cyrus himself. Epiphanies are too hastily come by and loose ends too easily tied up. Its as if the Duplass brothers shied away from their independent instincts and in the end formed their own co-dependent relationship with all things conventional. Consequently what should have remained complicated gets simple and what might have stayed compelling grows dull. Cyrus is a brave movie until it isnt heading out adventurously into the wacky world only to move cravenly back home.

Comments click to enlarge Cyrus Recommended Video Rated R  92 minutes  2010 If youve been wondering what would happen when the mumblecore filmmakers matriculated into the commercial mainstream wonder no more this Fox Searchlight comedy by brothers Jay and Mark Duplass (Baghead The Puffy Chair) gains immeasurably from its talented big-name actors but preserves the brothers unadorned storytelling and assured characterization. A divorced sad sack (John C. Reilly) falls head over heels for a vivacious single mother (Marisa Tomei); theyre great for each other but their romance is consistently undermined by the sneaky oedipal machinations of her possessive 21-year-old son Cyrus. As the furiously passive-aggressive title character Jonah Hill delivers a craftier comic performance than anything in his box-office hits (Superbad Get Him to the Greek) but what really elevates the story above its shticky premise is the combined neuroses of all three characters; like any family unit theyre just trying to navigate each others hang-ups well enough to be happy.

Photo Chuck Zlotnick AP Real storytelling from Duplass brothers 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Cyrus Comedy-Drama. Starring John C. Reilly Marisa Tomei and Jonah Hill. Directed by Jay Duplass and Mark Duplass. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Cyrus"" is the third film in four years by the Duplass brothers who continue to resist two destructive temptations. They are wisely not imitating their previous successes but instead are choosing to branch out in terms of scale narrative and budget. And they are not setting out to show how intelligent they are. They are not trying to prove themselves to snobs who arent paying close enough attention to realize theyre brilliant. Instead theyre following their own path and vision. It is too soon to say that these guys constitute one of the best and most hopeful strains in American cinema today. But it is not too soon to introduce the idea by saying its too soon to say it. Already the Duplass name on a motion picture is reason for anticipated pleasure and careful scrutiny. Theyre telling new kinds of stories about new kinds of people. Under cover of a seemingly fumbling and stumbling style theyre offering tight narratives and incisive character portraits. As in ""The Puffy Chair"" and ""Baghead"" the Duplasses once again show themselves in ""Cyrus"" to be very good at delineating character and at conveying strong feelings. And so we meet John (John C. Reilly) a professional copy editor who has been in an emotional trough ever since his wife left him seven years ago. Now the wife (Catherine Keener) who is about to remarry is encouraging him to go out and make himself available and so he puts on his leather sports jacket and heads off to a party. Trying to pick up women is awkward past a certain age like trying to burglarize a house while carrying your own siren and wearing a flashing neon sign that says ""Thief."" At one point John gives up and just tells a woman how hes feeling and its a beautiful description of the character as he might describe himself He has been depressed for years but he feels that he has something to offer that hes essentially a fun-loving guy who just happens to be miserable. The woman walks away but a few minutes later another woman who has heard his speech approaches him and shes played by Marisa Tomei. Younger folks may need to have this explained to them If you are a single man over 40 and a woman like Marisa Tomei comes over expressing appreciation and interest this is not merely good news or even very good news. Rather this is something - like say watermelon or the 1969 Mets - thats akin to proof of a benevolent God. No wonder he cant believe it and asks if shes flirting with him. ""Why?"" he asks. ""Im like Shrek"" In trying to convey the flavor and style of the Duplasses storytelling it may seem as though Ive given away loads of plot. In fact Ive told you only about the first seven or eight minutes. The movie is called ""Cyrus"" and youve heard nothing yet about this title character - Tomeis son in the picture - who is played by Jonah Hill with an eerie and watchful shrewdness. The Duplasses are showing how modern Americans think talk and live. Like Woody Allen their world is fairly specific in this case white educated artistically minded culturally plugged in but struggling. Not poor but fairly broke. But instead of just offering slices of life which might be interesting enough they are devising real stories and placing vivid characters in collision. Suffice it to say that ""Cyrus"" though funny and unexpected is also chamber drama about three people in a compressed atmosphere who feel that everything they have - or at least everything they love - is at stake. Dont be fooled by the casual style. There is nothing casual about these emotions or about the talent of these two filmmakers. -- Advisory Strong language sex talk and sexual situations.

"Cyrus review Mother son and suitor in a funny love triangle - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 3 1/2 starsCyrus review Mother son and suitor in a funny love triangleJune 23 2010""Cyrus"" amuses and unnerves in equal measure. A comedy of discomfort that walks a wonderful line between reality-based emotional honesty and engaging humor it demonstrates the good things that happen when quirky independent style combines with top-of-the-line acting skill. That style belongs to the writing-directing brother team of Jay and Mark Duplass stalwarts of the bargain-basement approach often called mumblecore. Their work in films such as ""The Puffy Chair"" and ""Baghead"" involves free-floating camerawork shooting in continuity and actors willing to improvise off of a written script all with an eye to heightening the authenticity of their stories. If youre going to work that way it helps considerably to have smart experienced and adventurous actors and in ""Cyrus"" the Duplass brothers have made that happen. With a cast that includes gifted veterans John C. Reilly Marisa Tomei and Catherine Keener as well as relative newcomer Jonah Hill they have moved up from their shambling mumblecore roots and made something satisfying and substantial. It also helps if the story that unfolds is as unsettling and unexpectedly adult as the one ""Cyrus"" relates. Told with great sensitivity to character and performance the film reveals the serio-comic strains of an intense relationship between two men and a woman that plays like a classic romantic triangle though in truth it is hardly that. It is Reillys John a freelance film editor we meet first and in the most embarrasing way possible Hes surprised in an intimate sexual moment by his ex-wife and best friend Jamie (Keener). She arrives at his house unannounced to tell him that after seven years of being divorced and single she is marrying the sane and sensible Tim ( Matt Walsh). John has never recovered from that divorce and Reilly whose impeccable naturalness makes him one of our best actors knows just how to play the man. John may come off as a hapless borderline desperate guy whose life is in a definite tailspin but Reilly by bringing his personal weight to the equation lets us know there is a core of value in John just waiting to be awakened and embraced. Primed to cause that awakening or so it seems at first is Tomeis irresistible and engaging Molly. The two meet cute at a party John had to be dragged to and after some delicious flirtation -- ""Im like Shrek"" he says ""Why are you talking to me?"" -- they end up in bed and on the way to being in love. Theres just one hitch. Her life is complicated she says and though John nods when he hears this he has no idea just what that means. The complication is named Cyrus and as smartly played by Judd Apatow alumnus Hill in a blessedly nonraunchy role he is Mollys nearly 22-year-old son. When you throw in that Molly both raised and home-schooled Cyrus all by herself and that he still lives at home with no sign of leaving you have a situation where mother and son are closer and more attached to each other than a whole lot of married couples. So not only does John have to get used to Molly never wanting to close the door of her bedroom or Cyrus thinking nothing of going into the bathroom while his mother is taking a shower he has to deal with Cyrus inscrutable personality. A kind of overweight sphinx Cyrus proves to be intriguingly difficult for John and audiences to get a handle on. A creature of blank unreadable looks Cyrus presents himself as honest and friendly but under the guise of ""I was just messing around"" he almost at once starts to needle John. And it gets worse. For unless we and John are imagining things which is always possible what we have here is a sub rosa battle to the death for Mollys love and attention. Is Cyrus trying to break up the lovers? Is John over his head in a comic psychodrama not of his own choosing? Beautifully played by all three principals who understand where the warmth the laughs and the conflicts lie ""Cyrus"" is a relationship drama that rings all the truer for being one we have not seen before. And will not soon forget. 3 stars MPAA rating R for language and some sexual material Cast John C. Reilly (John); Jonah Hill (Cyrus); Marisa Tomei (Molly); Catherine Keener (Jamie); Matt Walsh (Tim).

"Cyrus A boys best friend is his mother | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCyrus A boys best friend is his motherJonah Hill is the boy-man who wont let his mom go in this latest minimalist study in maximum emotions from Mark and Jay Duplass.Jonah Hill left Marisa Tomei and John C. Reilly star in Cyrus.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 24 2010 Cyrus (out of 4) Starring John C. Reilly Marisa Tomei Jonah Hill and Catherine Keener. Written and directed by Mark and Jay Duplass. At the Varsity. 92 minutes. 14A The most sincere moment in any movie you are likely to see this year comes in the twitch of an angry neck vein. Its the involuntary reaction of John C. Reillys put-upon character John as he suddenly realizes that diplomacy is getting him nowhere. His massive mitts are near the neck of his tormenter and someone may stop breathing. This could be John if his bulging vein finally explodes. The object of his ire is Cyrus (Jonah Hill) the 21-year-old son of Johns new girlfriend Molly (Marisa Tomei). The baby-faced boy-man is the title character and pointed focus of Cyrus the latest minimalist study in maximum emotions from the talented brotherly team of Mark and Jay Duplass. Cyrus has what might politely be called mommy issues. He still lives at home - dad is long gone -- and hes not happy about another man entering Mollys life. He understands that hes difficult to get close to (""I get overly excited sometimes"") but he cant help himself. Neither can John who is also operating on an instinctive and self-destructive level. He recognizes a lot of Cyrus in himself a major reason why he finds his nemesis so vexing. The Brothers Duplass find humor and a lot of truth in those moments between spoken words when the flick of an eyelid the pulse of a vein or the purse of the lips can betray things that might otherwise not be stated. This is the brothers third feature after the well-received The Puffy Chair and Baghead and the first to have anything resembling a Hollywood budget or cast. But dont expect one of those brightly lit confections that offer low-wattage insights. The Duplass siblings retain their devotion to restless camerawork relentless (and revealing) attention to detail and an almost religious fervor for improvised acting and emotional encounters. They cast well supply a sturdy story framework (but not all the dialogue) and then trust their talent to deliver the goods. Which everyone does with vein-popping glory in Cyrus even when it looks like it might kill them or just embarrass them down to their britches. Reillys John is the first before the firing line greeting the viewer and his ex-wife Jamie (Catherine Keener) as she accidentally walks in on a session of self-love. Jamie has come to Johns unkempt home to tell him of her impending marriage to the humorless Tim (Matt Walsh) news that John doesnt take well. Its been seven years since he and Jamie split -- she just couldnt handle his dark moods anymore -- but to John its been like seven minutes. He reluctantly accepts Jamies invitation to get out of the house and go to a party planning to drink himself into a stupor and make a fool of himself as per usual. But then he meets the beguiling Molly who sees not a loser but rather a kind and funny man and before you know it the two are off the dance floor and into the sack. Hes careful though not to push his luck. In one of those telling moments that the Duplass bros. do so well John goes to a drug store to buy condoms and hesitates over the extra-large box of Trojans before settling for the smaller one. Everything goes so amazing well John starts to worry that hes in one of those western movies where its just too quiet out there. Sure enough trouble arrives in the hulking person of Cyrus the grown son Molly neglected to mention off the top. Cyrus pretends to be okay with John sleeping over even supportive of it. He wants his mom to be happy. But then things start to happen such as Johns shoes mysteriously vanishing. This could almost be a horror or suspense movie and in some ways it is -- the soundtrack often takes on the rapid-pulse aspects of a thriller. Cyrus obviously has emotional and possibly mental issues but theyre not clearly defined and there is apparently no limit to what hes prepared to do to keep his mommy to himself. This is the first film Ive seen Hill in where he inhabits a difficult character instead of just using it as a springboard for smartass one-liners. His Cyrus could have been a cartoon character in an escalating series of violent exchanges with John as some directors would have wanted. Instead we get a wounded human whose demands for attention seem all too real and not completely without merit. Cyrus finally and firmly establishes Hill as an actor. Reilly Tomei and Keener dont need to prove anything but they respond to the opportunity afforded by the film to really let it all hang out veins included. No necks were harmed in the making of Cyrus but many tired relationship cliches were and lets raise a glass to that.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + With ""Cyrus Jonah Hill finally gets the Big Baby part that has been laying in wait his whole short career. Actually the title role of the squirmy new comedy from Jay and Mark Duplass may remind you of Baby Huey the giant infantile duck from old comic books. Put a diaper on Hill and stick an oversize bottle in his mouth and the illusion would be complete. Just dont hold the image in your head too long.Cyrus is 20 and he lives at home with his mother Molly composing reasonably awful electronic music and scaring potential boyfriends away. Molly is played with aching comic fragility by Marisa Tomei and whatever has happened in her life -- and whoever is responsible for the other half of Cyruss DNA -- it has left her gun-shy of men and content in a hermetic quasi-incestuous relationship with her son.Into this hothouse wanders John (John C. Reilly) a divorced sad sack -- the kind of guy who unburdens himself to strange women at parties -- who cant believe that Molly would give him a tumble. An immediate problem with the movie is that we dont believe it either. She does though and the early scenes are a bumptious romantic comedy of desperation and hope.Then John meets Cyrus and the games begin. The kid is superficially friendly but little things seem off -- the hostile froglike stare Cyrus gives John when he thinks no ones looking the sneaker that unaccountably goes missing when John stays overnight. The film seems poised to build scene by scene toward a grand comic explosion of jealousy and immature behavior.Instead ""Cyrus goes off like a succession of squibs not bang but pop-pop-pop. Maybe its wrong to expect otherwise from the Duplass brothers who with 2005s ""The Puffy Chair and the drolly funny ""Baghead (2008) represent the (slightly) more commercial wing of the so-called Mumblecore movement. The duo specializes in setting up uncomfortable but loaded comic situations and letting their casts wing their way through. The approach can work with the right actors but its the exact opposite of precision farce -- more like shaggy observational slapstick -- and too often their movies just lie there refusing to gather momentum.This marks the first time the Duplasses have worked with known stars -- actually ""Cyrus may be the sellout theyve been moving toward all along. They do hold on to their shaky-cam shooting technique -- itself a hollow visual signifier of indie cred -- and the actors including Catherine Keener (of course) as Johns remarkably patient ex-wife know how to find the beats. The awkward stop/start politeness between Cyrus and his moms new beau is at times so painful that its a relief when the gloves come off and the conflict moves into open war for Mollys affections.Yet the filmmakers reliance on improvisation puts the focus on individual scenes and there are no bigger ideas or energy holding the movie together. Im always happy to watch Reilly do his Deputy Droop-a-long thing -- he makes the character cringingly real -- and a Hill who bottles his rage instead of spewing it out is an interesting wrinkle. Id be happier still if Tomei had an actual character to play rather than one whose personality changes with the needs of the script. But the Duplasses have always been much smarter about men than women.Most frustrating ""Cyrus is a black comedy that consistently pulls its punches refusing to explore the weirder darker aspects of its own premise. Its too slack to shock. The film has its moments but it shows the Duplasses poised on the edge of the big time with nothing to say and no real interest in risk. Come to think of it theyll probably do just fine.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Jonah Hill nurses a serious Oedipal complex in Mark and Jay Duplass Cyrus. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 18 2010 617 PM Get Him to the Shrink Jonah Hill nurses a serious Oedipal complex in Cyrus. By Dana Stevens Cyrus Cyrus (Fox Searchlight) a 90-minute wisp of a romantic comedy directed by the brothers Mark and Jay Duplass ( The Puffy Chair Baghead) will divide critical opinion in ways disproportionate to its modest ambition. Those who have a bone to pick with ""mumblecore""--the awkwardly named semi-movement from which the Duplasses spring--will find the movie irritatingly random too in love with its meandering partly improvised dialogue and occasionally opaque characters. Others champions of this still-young tradition of minimalist movies with loose jagged rhythms may find Cyrus a disappointingly watered-down concession to mainstream dude comedy in the Apatow mold. Then come the significant swaths of potential viewers who dont know mumblecore cinema from albacore tuna. Theyll come to this movie because 1) Jonah Hill ruled in Superbad 2) John C. Reilly was funny as hell in Walk Hard and 3) Marisa Tomei looked good on a stripper pole in The Wrestler. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. As it happens I concur with only two out of those three statements. Reilly and Tomei are the kind of actors who class up whatever joint they appear in but the appeal of Jonah Hill is generally lost on me. Its only when he plays the kind of character he did in Forgetting Sarah Marshall--a needy clingy outsider whos constantly trying and failing to conceal his own base motives--that Hills popularity begins to make sense to me. His Cyrus a 21-year-old college dropout who lives with his mother is that kind of character. Cyrus--and to a less pathological degree everyone else in this movie--invests a great deal of energy in trying to come across as an exemplary human being a sensitive soul a good listener. All the while hes secretly a-boil with hurt and rage. Cyrus is the kind of character who in a less offbeat movie would eventually be found to have a trove of flayed squirrels hidden in his garage. Without spoiling Cyrus for anyone I can permit myself to reveal that Jonah Hills character harbors nary a flayed squirrel. The violence this film inflicts on its characters and its audience is mainly psychological but its none the less painful for that. Advertisement Cyrus is the movies title character but not really its protagonist. That would be John (Reilly) a freelance film editor in his 40s whos been alone and depressed since his divorce seven years ago. (He was dumped by the always-exquisite Catherine Keener--I can see how that would get a guy down.) Dragged by his concerned ex and her now-fiance (Matt Walsh) to a house party John strikes out mortifyingly with girl after girl. Even more disastrous than his attempts at suavity is a last-ditch campaign to disarm with candor--""Im in a tailspin. Im really hurting here."" But though that confession sends the woman its aimed at scurrying for cover its overheard by Molly (Tomei) whos touched by Johns raw honesty. In one of the movies best moments she comes to his rescue when he drunkenly decides to turn the sedate cocktail party into a dance party by turning up the music full blast and bellowing ""Dance party"" (Who among us can truthfully say we havent been there?) Things develop quickly between Molly and John--a little too quickly to be dramatically plausible--but he cant figure out why even as theyre falling madly in love he cant convince her to spend the night. So he tails her car home one day--and finds himself face to face with Cyrus her grown son whos both creepily solicitous and a master of passive aggression. While guilelessly seeming to encourage his mothers promising new relationship Cyrus does everything in his power to sabotage it taking them each aside Iago-style to plant doubts about the others level of commitment. Midway through the movie theres a satisfying comic shift as the two men privately acknowledge how much they loathe each other while continuing to put on a touchy-feely show for Mollys benefit. The Oedipal myth lurks just beneath the surface of nearly every one of this movies jokes and also provides much of its drama. On their daily outings to the park Molly and Cyrus cuddle and tickle each other like lovers and Cyrus insists that she sleep in his room whenever he has night terrors. In one line of dialogue thats a little too on-the-nose Cyrus assures Molly that her new relationship is OK because ""you need someone to love you in the way that I cant love you."" Mining the incest prohibition for laughs in whats essentially a light romantic comedy is a bold move and for the first two-thirds of the movie it works surprisingly well. But as long as the Duplasses are willing to go there I cant help but wish theyd gone a little further. The unhealthy intensity of the Molly/Cyrus bond is treated more as an obstacle to John and Mollys potential happiness than as a story point in itself. If John really is falling for a woman whos in love with her own son their problems arent going to be over just because the son gets out of the way. Theres a mumblecore trick which I usually quite like of ending a movie just a moment ""too soon""--stopping a beat before a conventional film would thus forcing the viewer to decide what conclusions to draw from that brief last shot. (Andrew Bujalski deploys this technique with finesse in both Funny Ha Ha and Beeswax.) But Cyrus ends a full 10 minutes too soon with all three of the main characters emotional arcs still incomplete. The oblique final scene seems intended to leave the viewer in a state of delicious suspense but it feels more like a frustratingly underwritten limbo.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Cyrus amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << The Karate Kid Toy Story 3 >> Cyrus Never come between a mother and her child. But what if the child is Jonah Hill a college-age codependent who calls himself a freelance DJ and mom Marisa Tomei his best friend? Writer-director-brothers Jay and Mark Duplass split the difference between comedy and agony in this awkward charmer about the man who dares brave the twosomes Highland Park hideaway--though ""brave"" is a big word for John C. Reillys depressive divorced loner. He and Tomei meet at a party where hes been toted by ex-wife Catherine Keener and her new fiancee Matt Walsh to drink himself into oblivion. Sure their first words happen when Tomei surprises him peeing on a hedge but the bohemian nurturer immediately clues in to the hollow in his heart and decides to help him fill it. That night she springs out of his bed and runs home like a princess under the spell of an ogre. Which when we first meet Hill isnt too far from the truth. The comedian is great as emotionally stunted son Cyrus; like a badger surprised in his burrow hes at once vulnerable and menacing. Tomei ripe and soft plays her role like a tender peach--we get why both men wont share this sweet naif but while shes their focus her characters merely a tool for the script. As Reilly and Hills aggression escalates from lying to stealing to threats Cyrus teeters into slapstick (instead of Step Brothers its Step Son) only it pulls back when things get too loud. The films slim and tonally off-balance and it rushes its ending but moment to moment its miserably enjoyable and true especially Reillys turn as a regressed adult who slowly learns to stand tall and strong and be the man his woman deserves the man Hill regrets biology wont let him be.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Welcome to the brilliantly bizarro world of the Duplass brothers Mark and Jay champions of DIY filmmaking and leaders of mumblecore a movement of microbudget indie films shot digitally with unknown actors who improv talk talk talk to get at the emotions their educated aimless characters cant articulate. The Duplass brothers known for their short films (best intro is This Is John in which Mark Duplass slaves for seven minutes to get his answering-machine message just right) have contributed two splendidly quirky features to mumblecore The Puffy Chair and Baghead. Cyrus is not a DIY film. The Duplass bros are flying with studio financing major actors technical finesse and buzz from sold-out previews at the Sundance and South by Southwest film fests. But no way have the guys gone Hollywood. Their approach remains character-based and their wit - demented as it is - never breaks the bonds of our shared humanity. Molly tries to keep John away from her son. Its John who knocks on the door to find the home-schooled housebound sonny boy a New Age musician with his own synth-pop studio. Hill knocks the role out of the park nailing every nuance comic tender and scary. The eww factor kicks in when Cyrus saunters into the bathroom where his mom is showering and closes the door. You may fear for Johns life when he spends the night. Its more likely youll be laughing till it hurts. In a multiplex crowded with formula rom-coms divorced from genuine feeling (thats you Sex and the Shitty) Cyrus brims over with hilarity and heartbreak. Cheers to the Duplass brothers for encouraging the actors to fill in the outlines of the script with their own grit and grace notes. Hill Reilly and Tomei could not be better riffing off each other like skilled jazz musicians in their portrayals of characters who are damaged goods. Cyrus the summers best most original and crazily inventive comedy is potently funny and painfully real. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 18 2010 Save for later Saved Marisa Tomei Johan Hill and John C. Reilly star in the new movie Cyrus. Chuck Zlotnick/Fox Searchlight/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of John C. Reilly has an uncanny gift for making his characters seem simultaneously depressed and lively. In ""Cyrus"" hes found his archetypal role as John a sometime editor and layabout who after seven years is still reeling from his divorce. (He was dumped.) When he finds out his ex-wife (Catherine Keener) is remarrying he goes into a tailspin but in a deus ex machina moment the woman of his dreams Molly (Marisa Tomei) comes up to him at a party and pretty soon theyre a couple. The catch Her live-in 21-year-old son Cyrus (Jonah Hill) Mollys best friend and as soon becomes obvious (though not to Molly) Johns worst enemy.Written and directed by the brothers Jay and Mark Duplass ""Cyrus"" is a furtive little farce with a deadpan style all its own. Reilly doesnt go for the obvious laughs. Johns ardor for Molly is actually quite touching which is why when Cyrus threatens to wreck his elation hes both bereft and enraged.Tomei doesnt reach for obvious effects either. Her Molly may be clueless about Cyruss inner imp but shes no dingbat. She wants things to work out with John but she also wants Cyrus to be happy. On some level she probably does see Cyrus for the relationship-wrecker that he is but shes repressed it. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Hill is so familiar to us from playing mumbly sweet-souled goofballs most recently in ""Get Him to the Greek"" thats its a bit off-putting to see him playing a tightly wound beady-eyed creep. But even here theres more than meets the eye and ear. Hill manages to convey Cyruss real pain as well as his faked pain. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Cyrus"" slows down by the end and even before then its often too mopey for its own good. But theres an original comic temperament at work here and thats rare.

Big and fleshy a nice guy but as played by John C. Reilly kind of lost. Oh he has excuses Hes still smarting from his divorce -- seven years ago -- and cant believe his ex has moved on. Still even he thinks he should be able to put up a better front. Drunk at a party hes been dragged to hes getting shot down so often by the women hes attempting to pick up that after a while he barely even tries to make conversation. Enter Molly played by Marisa Tomei; with her hes got chemistry. She goes home with John -- starts seeing him regularly even. But no matter how intimate they become she always slips out of his apartment before dawn and she never invites John to her place. Finally he goes over anyway to snoop and gets a surprise Shes got a son a chubby clingy 21-year-old named Cyrus. Mollys neglected to mention him possibly because their relationship is so close that theres not much room for anyone else. John quickly senses a passive-aggressive edge to Cyrus apparent friendliness and before long theyre locked in a ferocious competition for Mollys affection -- always pretending of course that theyre best of buddies when shes around. Now its easy to see how this could turn coarse and conventional in the wrong hands. Jonah Hill who plays Cyrus has mostly turned up before in slapsticky commercial comedies -- Superbad Forgetting Sarah Marshall Get Him to the Greek and such. This happily isnt one and hes dialed his personality way back. Whats left is sort of a bottled-up menace that audiences will very likely find nearly as unsettling as his rival does. Because this is a Duplass Bros. film nothings ever allowed to go over the top. The filmmakers -- mumblecore moguls if such a thing can be said to exist -- prefer a squirmy kind of comedy thats all about the awkward situations real people find themselves in. And with these performers the vibe stays down-to-earth and almost entirely unpredictable. Cyrus still had me guessing at the final fade which is something I cant say about any other Hollywood comedy so far this year and something I wish I could say more often.

Reilly and Jonah Hill bring some uncomfortable laughs to Mark and Jay Duplass Cyrus. (Fox Searchlight) Joe Neumaier Thursday June 17 2010 451 PM Title Cyrus The comedy of discomfort that runs through ""Cyrus"" is often about several things at once. But the most prevalent emotion in this quirky yet genuine movie is the awkwardness that comes with trying to fit into someone elses life. We all have routines but the characters in ""Cyrus"" have complicated systems for dealing with things and watching them smash into each other is endearing and often hilarious. John (John C. Reilly) is a Los Angeles guy whose life as he drunkenly tells a stranger at a party is in a tailspin. His ex-wife Jamie (Catherine Keener) still his best friend seven years after they split is about to get remarried an event that might turn John into a mess if he werent there already. Then John meets Molly (Marisa Tomei) whos sexy funky and amazingly into him. Things go great until he meets her 21-year-old son Cyrus (Jonah Hill) an odd duck still living at home and very protective of his mom. Molly never mentioned Cyrus but once he and John start their standoff for her affections its clear that while two boy-men will enter her home only one will leave. Written and directed by Jay and Mark Duplass charter members of the mumblecore film movement (the brothers made ""The Puffy Chair"" and Mark appeared in ""Hannah Takes the Stairs"" ""Humpday"" and ""Greenberg"") ""Cyrus"" has a slight resemblance to lesser Judd Apatow-style loser-fests.What sets it apart is actual inner conflict -- in addition to Johns problems Molly worries that the artsy insular way she raised Cyrus as a single mom did him a disservice while Jamie is in denial about what her almost maternal connection to John is doing to her fiance. No one here is confident that theyve taken the right path. Yes it makes for some uneasiness but Reilly is a terrifically doughy everyman and Hill (also in ""Get Him to the Greek"") puts some acting behind his vacant big-guy stare. Watching both of them work out their problems is worth the effort. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Something -- or someone -- has got to give.Cyrus (R) Fox Searchlight (92 min.) Directed by Jay Duplass Mark Duplass. With John C. Reilly Marisa Tomei Jonah Hill. Now playing in New York. Rating note The film contains brief nudity sexual situations strong language and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whittys rating Three stars First though theres going to be a lot pushing and pulling and thats what forms the bulk of the quietly amusing ""Cyrus"" a small sharply observed movie and a mainstream move from Jay and Mark Duplass. The directing brothers had previously starting with ""The Puffy Chair"" staked out a position in the ""mumblecore"" movement -- a series of no-budget films shot with shaky cameras bad sound and amateur actors. The do-it-yourself ethos seemed a little inspired by punk-rock --  except those amateurs could play their instruments a little. The mumble movies often felt less like Just Do It than Who Cares How You Do It? ""Cyrus"" is a smart step forward keeping most of that schools positives (intimate settings semi-improvised scenes awkward honesty) while jettisoning most of the off-putting amateurish slip-ups. It helps that it has a fast-paced script that introduces us to lonely middle-aged John then introduces him to lively funny Molly -- and quickly complicates things by bringing on the clinging Cyrus. It also helps that the cast includes John C. Reilly (who too often settles for awful comedies like ""Walk Hard"" and ""Step Brothers"") and Marisa Tomei (nicely sensitive and secretive in an underwritten role). Theres also Jonah Hill. Usually a little Hill goes a long way and theres a lot of Hill here. (Theres also a shot of Reillys rear end which my eyes really could have done without.) But its hard to think of better casting for a spooky slacker son and Hill smartly underplays it. Whats here is good enough to make you wish the Duplasses had gone even a little further. Even if the sound and focus are better this time their dedication to improv still means a lot of sloppy filmmaking (flatly lit sets hasty zooms) and awkward writing. Its all about the moment and the actors and not about cool controlled art. Or maybe you believe that Tomei would start flirting with a drunken Reilly while he was urinating in someones backyard. Or that there isnt something more than a little creepy about a twentysomething who has no apparent sex drive but loves cuddling with his hot mom. ""Cyrus"" isnt willing to go too far with that angle and it never quite builds on its own jokes -- another problem with relying too much on on-the-set inspiration and not enough on sweat-of-the-brow preparation. But it is a step forward for these filmmakers. And a definite change of pace from the usual comedies currently clogging summer theaters.

Reilly). ABOUT THE MOVIECyrus   1/2 out of four Stars John C. Reilly Marisa TomeiJonah Hill Catherine KeenerDirectors Jay Duplass and Mark DuplassDistributor Fox Searchlight PicturesRating R for language and some sexual materialRunning time 1 hour 32 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Middle-aged romance can be a dicey prospect. And it gets more complicated when children are in the picture. But it gets more complex still if the ""child"" is actually 21 and creepily meddlesome. Such is the conflict posed in the cleverly offbeat Cyrus. What makes this dark comedy work so well is the way in which directors Jay and Mark Duplass build an original story on a broad even farcical foundation and leaven it with nuance. Its an edgy engrossing comedy with an art-house sensibility and mainstream appeal. Amid the laughs emotional truths loom large for each of its rather odd characters. The story centers on John (John C. Reilly) a sad sack whose ex-wife Jamie (Catherine Keener) is soon to be remarried. Johns life is a cringe fest until he meets the warmhearted Molly (Marisa Tomei). John is not a total loser just a lonely goofball. Reilly plays pathetic well with a lovable quality that keeps us rooting for him. Whether in low-budget films or major studio fare or even musicals such as Chicago Reilly is one of the best character actors working in Hollywood. Reilly and Tomei have credible chemistry convincing us that these two damaged adults may actually have found their soul mates. But their romance runs into a rather sizable snag in the form of Mollys maladjusted son Cyrus (a weirdly funny Jonah Hill). Molly and Cyrus have an unusually close bond that gives new meaning to the term ""mollycoddled."" A rivalry between Cyrus and John is hilarious. Who knew there was so much humor to be found in an Oedipal complex? Hill plays a very different character from his usual harmless geeks in Get Him to the Greek or Superbad. He nails Cyrus sense of menace laced with brattiness making this his best and most complex performance. The story is never predictable. The Duplass brothers (The Puffy Chair) fuse comedy tragedy and discomfort polishing their usual ""mumblecore"" style making it more accessible. This is no simple tale of a spoiled son intent on derailing his moms romance. Nor is it just a comic look at a twisted mother-son relationship. It sometimes seems about to go off in a vile direction then wisely pulls back. Above all it deftly captures the ambiguity and absurdity of human relationships. With improvised dialogue and performances that go from uncomfortable to honest Cyrus is an off-kilter charmer.

Her shtik was to cry ""Dealbreaker"" about every possible flaw in a relationship. Your husband wont take a two-week vacation with your parents? DealbreakerIts not hard to imagine what Liz would say about the predicament in which John (John C. Reilly) finds himself in Cyrus. Johns met Molly the woman of his dreams (Marisa Tomei) but her creepy adult son (Jonah Hill) who still lives at home is way too tied to Moms apron strings. He thinks nothing of using the bathroom while his mothers in the shower wrestles and cuddles with her during a picnic and warns John flat-out the first time they meet ""Dont f--k my mom."" The dysfunction goes both ways as evidenced by a snapshot John finds Molly nursed Cyrus until he was practically old enough to order a shot of whisky to go with the milk. Clearly Mollys relationship with Cyrus should be a dealbreaker.But that would mean Cyrus would be a 15-minute movie instead of a 90-minute one. To filmmakers Jay and Mark Duplasss credit the implausibility of Johns sticking around as long as he does doesnt completely undermine the films credibility. And John does eventually say enoughs enough. But the film highlights an interesting problem of many romantic comedies making us continue to care about characters who stubbornly refuse to see that their beloved is bad news. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week In literature and drama dramatic irony where the reader or audience knows more than the character creates tension while investing the reader more deeply in the characters point of view. Cyrus employs dramatic irony by letting the audience see the title character behaving manipulatively and duplicitously (telling his mom one thing and John another) while both Molly and John are not privy to the same information. But Johns best interests quickly become at cross-purposes with the films as we want John to save himself by getting out of the relationship as soon as possible. The movie becomes a horror film (dont look under the bed) instead of a romantic comedy.In order for the film to truly succeed we must believe the stakes for Johns staying with Molly are as high as those for him leaving. In the opening scenes the movie establishes that John has been deeply depressed since his divorce seven years ago and Molly is the first woman he feels a connection with. But our evidence of Johns bliss is mostly based on montages of John and Molly walking hand in hand and John telling his ex-wife how much he really really likes Molly. This is all lovely but it cant compete with the vivid specificity of Cyruss creepiness (devastatingly enacted by Hill).The 1993 Mike Myers comedy (remember those?) So I Married an Axe Murderer spoofs this cinematic convention by having Myerss character blithely disregard the niggling detail that his dream girl happens to be a serial killer. Some Like It Hot similarly lampoons the notion of love conquering all with Joe E. Brown unfazed to discover his inamorata is actually an inamorato. But most films adhere to the convention without acknowledging it--in Killers for example the fact that her husband leads a double life as a hit man gives Katherine Heigls character only a moments pause.Cyrus successfully walks the line between dark comedy and scary movie thanks to the performances by Hill Reilly and Tomei which are uniformly great. And the suggestion never fully developed that John may have a too-close-for-comfort relationship with his ex-wife raises an interesting question about his own dysfunctional tendencies. If this had been explored further it might have taken the pressure off the relationship between Molly and John. A man who calls his ex-wife in the middle of the night to complain about his love life?

The church is desanctified in ""Moneyball"" whose context is runaway commerce and whose subtext is statistics--i.e. a scientific approach to the major-league version of the game that seeks to sweep away nostalgic notions and dry the moist eyes of the faithful. Never before though have statistics added up to such electrifying entertainment. After the mostly minor-league productions of recent months this movie which was directed by Bennett Miller renews your belief in the power of movies. ENLARGE Brad Pitt as the Oakland Athletics Billy Beane in Moneyball. Columbia Pictures Brad Pitt plays--to perfection--Billy Beane the current Oakland Athletics general manager who in 2002 guided his small-market underfunded team to an unprecedented 20 consecutive wins. (He was the subject of the Michael Lewis book from which the script an inventive work of fiction based on fact has been adapted by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin.) In that year as the film has it Billy finds salvation from the As relative poverty--relative most painfully to the filthy-rich Yankees--by putting into practice the theories of Bill James whod been preaching the gospel of so-called sabermetrics. Instead of paying lavish salaries to superstars who sometimes fail to produce needed wins the cash-strapped GM--himself an ex-player who didnt deliver on his shining promise--depends on intricately detailed computer analyses of individual performance. By doing so hes able to buy specific talents embodied by players who might otherwise be unwanted or ignored. His brainiac aide in this abstruse enterprise is his assistant general manager Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). A young Yale-educated economist with a picture of Plato on his bedroom wall Pete knows little about baseball but lots about teasing the meaning out of equations and algorithms. ""Using stats the way we read them"" he tells Billy ""well find value players that no one else can see."" Watch a clip of ""Moneyball"" starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Courtesy Columbia Pictures. Theres nothing abstruse about the way ""Moneyball"" dramatizes the enterprise. Thanks to the elegant understatement of Mr. Hills portrayal the unworldly Pete provides a wonderful foil to Mr. Pitts eccentric flamboyant Billy in just about every scene they share. But just about every scene in the film crackles with intelligence brittle humor and edgy conflict; its not to minimize Mr. Zaillians gifts or those of the director to say that the dialogues pace and density evoke Mr. Sorkins screenplay for ""The Social Network."" Movie moments dont get much better than the staff meetings in which Billy takes on the panel of supposedly wise old executives and scouts who pick players for the As to hire (every one of them is wittily delineated) or the machine-gun-rapid succession of phone calls in which Billy negotiates with other teams for players he wants to buy. (The calls come too fast to follow in detail but theyre hugely enjoyable all the same.) Or Billys first encounter with Pete during a negotiating session with the top management of the Cleveland Indians. A relentlessly acute observer Billy senses that Pete an extremely junior member of the Indians staff is playing an almost silent but extremely important role. Confronting him later in a hallway Billy asks ""Who are you? What happened in that room?"" From top to bottom the casting is inspired. Mr. Pitt couples a star presence--theres a singular there there whenever the As general manager is in camera range--to a beautifully measured ensemble performance that makes Billy a minimalist ironist tossing off funny remarks with an abandon that almost conceals his deep anger pain or self-doubt. ""Good meeting"" he says brightly after a horrible meeting with his stern-faced field manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) an implacable foe of anything that smacks of sabermetrics ""Every time we talk Im reinvigorated by your love of the game."" More Baseball After Moneyball The Moneyball Myth Arts character is written rather repetitively--hes implacable and implacable and then implacable--but Mr. Hoffman as ever gives his man a special if ever-glowering cachet. Robin Wright does a brief graceful turn in the role of Billys estranged wife. Chris Pratt is affecting as Scott Hatteberg the washed-up catcher recycled by Billy according to sabermetric precepts into a valuable first-baseman. Billys daughter Casey is played by Kerris Dorsey a young actress in her feature debut whos the essence of sweet simplicity in a couple of crucial scenes. One of them is set in a music shop where Casey to her fathers boundless delight works out chords on a guitar and sings ever so tentatively. All you need know about the other with Casey behind the wheel of a car is that it serves to the films immense benefit as her exquisite loving postscript to the complex subject of her dad. The force that binds all of this fine work is fine direction. Whether Mr. Miller is dealing with the professional actors in his cast or with real-life baseball players standing in for the players and scouts of the Oakland As his touch is unerring and his narrative vision is clear. After only one documentary (""The Cruise"") and one feature (""Capote"" with Mr. Hoffman in the title role) he now takes his place in the first rank of American directors. The cinematographer Wally Pfister has already demonstrated his mastery in a string of Christopher Nolan films and won an Oscar for ""Inception""; this time he works stylishly but unobtrusively and that includes what may amount to an accidental sight gag when someone almost blocks the camera in the process of whispering in someone elses ear. ENLARGE Jonah Hill as Beanes assistant in Moneyball Columbia Pictures ""Moneyball"" was inspired as the familiar phrase goes by a true story. In fact Peter Brand is a dramatic invention and a very good one. In fact Billy Beane was not the first general manager to bring a statistical approach to the Oakland As; he continued the work begun by Sandy Alderson who gets credit in the book but doesnt figure in the film. One might also debate as my sportswriter colleague Allen Barra did in a separate Journal piece Thursday the factual accuracy of the book which may--or may not--have overstated the sabermetric case. As a work of fiction the film suffers from an energy sag toward the end by remaining admirably faithful to the odd nature of its source material. Because the Oakland As didnt get a World Series win in 2002 and because Billy Beanes life has never been blessed by the sort of conventional triumph that makes for great movie endings the films narrative pauses not once but twice while others remind the hero--and the audience--that he really did change major-league baseball and that he really does deserve to think well of himself. On the whole though the film gets many important things exactly right. It isnt about numbers be they player stats or the staggering sums spent by top-tier franchises even though the story seems at first to be asking us to root for the gimlet-eyed statistician rather than the sharp-eyed pitcher or batter; for data rather than intuition; for the cool satisfactions of science rather than the fevered romance of sport. What its really about is the old-fashioned heroism of a traditional hero in a fresh guise--a flawed guy with little to show for his 40-odd years; a smart guy who finds a way to make his smarts matter. ""Moneyball"" is a new manifestation of the old Yankee spirit though hardly in the Steinbrenner sense--a deeply American film about a uniquely American sport in which a principled guy takes on the moneyed titans because he cant stand the unfairness of what theyre doing to the game he still loves. Watch a clip of ""Machine Gun Preacher"" starring Gerard Butler. Courtesy Relativity Media. Machine Gun Preacher Sometimes the phrase ""based on a true story"" signals a failure of imagination. Thats the case in ""Machine Gun Preacher"" a would-be inspirational account of Sam Childers a drug-dealing biker thug who transformed by religious faith became a lay preacher in Pennsylvania and founded an organization to rescue children from the ravages of internecine warfare in East Africa. ENLARGE Gerard Butler as the titular Sam Childers in Machine Gun Preacher. Relativity Media The failure lies not with the films director Marc Forster nor with its impressive star Gerard Butler but with Jason Kellers dreadfully earnest script which charts the heros spiritual journey and his Rambo-esque exploits without offering a scintilla of mature perspective on his state of mind. Is Sam a saint or is he a zealot who ends up killing child soldiers on his own? Has he turned his native intelligence from a life of crime to a life of service or has he been driven mad by the suffering he finds after a casual first visit to embattled Sudan? No reason that it cant be any or all of the above but the films dramatic opacity can be maddening too. DVD FOCUS The Tree of Life (2011) ENLARGE The theatrical window grows ever narrower. On Oct. 11th Terrence Malicks exquisite and exasperating film will be available on DVD and Blu-ray (the latter format being preferable given the grandeur as well as the gorgeous simplicity of Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography). Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are a father and mother known only as Mr. and Mrs. OBrien in the 1950s Texas of the filmmakers youth. Mr. Pitt gives equal weight to his characters tyranny and thwarted dreams. Ms. Chastain has few words and doesnt need them to portray a woman struggling to preserve faith in the face of incomprehensible tragedy. Cyrus (2010) Jonah Hill is one side of a triangle in this dulcetly crazy and certifiably hilarious little comedy made by the Duplass brothers Jay and Mark. John C. Reilly is John still a lost soul seven years after his divorce. Marisa Tomei is Molly who comes out of nowhere at a party he has forced himself to attend. She is everything John could have wished for--smart kind pretty and a sex angel in the bargain. The only complication is her tangled relationship with Mr. Hills Cyrus her 21-year-old son who lives at home and is to say the least seriously weird. The Savages (2007) Philip Seymour Hoffman is Jon Savage a lovelorn professor of drama in Buffalo N.Y. Laura Linney is Wendy Savage Jons sister a would-be playwright in Manhattan The catalyst of Tamara Jenkinss charmingly distinctive comedy is Lenny Savage a nasty old reprobate played with pitiless brio by Philip Bosco. By hurtling headlong into dementia Lenny forces his children to take stock of their lives. At every step of the way Ms. Jenkins puts her people through changes as fascinating in their free-form fashion as the lava lamp that holds Lenny in befuddled thrall.

"Movie review Cyrus - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Judd ApatowMovie review CyrusThe Duplass brothers quirky style combines with the acting talents of John C. Reilly Marisa Tomei and Jonah Hill for an engaging comedy of discomfort.June 18 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Movie Critic ""Cyrus"" amuses and unnerves in equal measure. A comedy of discomfort that walks a wonderful line between reality-based emotional honesty and engaging humor it demonstrates the good things that happen when quirky independent style combines with top-of-the-line acting skill. That style belongs to the writing-directing brother team of Jay and Mark Duplass stalwarts of the bargain-basement approach often called mumblecore. Their work in films such as ""The Puffy Chair"" and ""Baghead"" involves free-floating camerawork shooting in continuity and actors willing to improvise off of a written script all with an eye to heightening the authenticity of their stories. If youre going to work that way it helps considerably to have smart experienced and adventurous actors and in ""Cyrus"" the Duplass brothers have made that happen. With a cast that includes gifted veterans John C. Reilly Marisa Tomei and Catherine Keener as well as relative newcomer Jonah Hill they have moved up from their shambling mumblecore roots and made something satisfying and substantial. It also helps if the story that unfolds is as unsettling and unexpectedly adult as the one ""Cyrus"" relates. Told with great sensitivity to character and performance the film reveals the serio-comic strains of an intense relationship between two men and a woman that plays like a classic romantic triangle though in truth it is hardly that. It is Reillys John a freelance film editor we meet first and in the most embarrasing way possible Hes surprised in an intimate sexual moment by his ex-wife and best friend Jamie (Keener). She arrives at his house unannounced to tell him that after seven years of being divorced and single she is marrying the sane and sensible Tim ( Matt Walsh). John has never recovered from that divorce and Reilly whose impeccable naturalness makes him one of our best actors knows just how to play the man. John may come off as a hapless borderline desperate guy whose life is in a definite tailspin but Reilly by bringing his personal weight to the equation lets us know there is a core of value in John just waiting to be awakened and embraced. Primed to cause that awakening or so it seems at first is Tomeis irresistible and engaging Molly. The two meet cute at a party John had to be dragged to and after some delicious flirtation a ""Im like Shrek"" he says ""Why are you talking to me?"" a they end up in bed and on the way to being in love. Theres just one hitch. Her life is complicated she says and though John nods when he hears this he has no idea just what that means. The complication is named Cyrus and as smartly played by Judd Apatow alumnus Hill in a blessedly nonraunchy role he is Mollys nearly 22-year-old son. When you throw in that Molly both raised and home-schooled Cyrus all by herself and that he still lives at home with no sign of leaving you have a situation where mother and son are closer and more attached to each other than a whole lot of married couples. So not only does John have to get used to Molly never wanting to close the door of her bedroom or Cyrus thinking nothing of going into the bathroom while his mother is taking a shower he has to deal with Cyrus inscrutable personality. A kind of overweight sphinx Cyrus proves to be intriguingly difficult for John and audiences to get a handle on. A creature of blank unreadable looks Cyrus presents himself as honest and friendly but under the guise of ""I was just messing around"" he almost at once starts to needle John. And it gets worse. For unless we and John are imagining things which is always possible what we have here is a sub rosa battle to the death for Mollys love and attention. Is Cyrus trying to break up the lovers? Is John over his head in a comic psychodrama not of his own choosing? Beautifully played by all three principals who understand where the warmth the laughs and the conflicts lie ""Cyrus"" is a relationship drama that rings all the truer for being one we have not seen before.

Reilly and Jonah Hil in Cyrus Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME In Cyrus the scariest romantic comedy of the year drunk depressed John (John C. Reilly) is urinating in the bushes outside a party when he first encounters Molly (Marisa Tomei). ""Nice penis"" she says archly. On this evening three women have already repelled his clumsy advances (""Im in a tailspin"" he confesses to one before insisting gamely that he is nonetheless capable of being a blast.) Molly tells him she overheard the tailspin speech and found it raw and compelling. Not only is this the kindest feminine appraisal hes had in years she actually seems interested. ""This is insane"" he mumbles in delighted protest. ""Im like Shrek."" (See TIMEs Summer Arts Preview.) John cant believe his good fortune. But naturally theres a catch. Molly has a son stashed at home. Not some whiny toddler or anxious pre-teen who doesnt want a stepfather but a beyond-full grown man Cyrus -- a 21 year-old played with horrifying intensity by Jonah Hill. Cyrus appears to be unemployed and Molly an advocate of home schooling doesnt seem to be pushing him to get a job. Plus he has his music. Listening to Cyruss instrumental dreck John says encouragingly ""Sounds like Steve Miller."" (Reilly is masterful in conveying Johns eager awkwardness.) ""No it doesnt"" Cyrus says flatly. For his first take-me-seriously role Hill has borrowed his Superbad co-star Michael Ceras nerdy close-cropped hairdo as well as his silent observational stare. When Cera does it theres the sense that hes about to say something witheringly witty; when Hill wears the stare we expect Cyrus to plunge a butcher knife into Johns back. Even though he tends more to passive-aggressive -- Johns sneakers go missing the first night he stays over at Mollys -- this feeling never quite fades. The film has its roots in the sleepy chatty films of the Mumblecore movement where its writer/directors Jay and Mark Duplass made their mark; but Cyrus is genuinely suspenseful. The Duplass brothers 2005 joint effort The Puffy Chair a sharp-eyed tale of a believably doomed relationship established their interest in the cinema of romantic discomfort. They have an ear for painfully realistic situations and dialogue that yields unforced low-key comedy. Mark Duplass who played the lead in Puffy also appeared in Greenberg where Ben Stiller dialed down his own comedy to surprising effect. There are similarities between that movie and this one but whereas Greenberg was a creep Hills Cyrus is truly creepy. When he calls his youthful mother Molly instead of Mom it sounds like incest. The Duplass brothers have shot Hill with brutal honesty stripped him of the flattering cinematography he gets in more traditional Hollywood comedies. Hes not just a psychic roadblock between Molly and John hes a physical one a fat one. (Watching this talented actor who has two movies out this month brings to mind Gabourey Sidibe. During Oscar season pop culture pundits wondered aloud how likely it would be for her to find more work after her Oscar-nominated turn in Precious. Has anyone ever said that about Hill?) (See photos from the 2010 Academy Awards.) John is like the amiable dope in a horror flick; we want to tell him to get the hell out of there. But Molly is lovely -- Tomei expertly keeps the characters zaniness in check and lets us see her compassion and maturity in the face of considerable obstacles -- and we understand why John is loath to give her up. The threat of a knife in his back literal or otherwise is half the fun of Cyrus but its greater point is to reveal the similarities between Cyrus and John. In the beginning of the relationship Molly leaves Johns bed twice in the middle of the night without offering an explanation -- shes not prepared to share the burden of Cyrus understandably -- and Johns solution is to follow her home and park out front until he gets some answers. Normal people call this stalking. Like Cyrus John is a big kid who needs to grow up. A mid-40s freelance editor hes been mourning his divorce from Jamie (Catherine Keener) for seven years. Their relationship has evolved into unhealthy co-dependency. Just as Cyrus commands Mollys attention whenever he has a night terror John rushes to Jamie for romantic advice. She patiently provides it even participating in a ruse to check out Molly and Cyrus and assess if their weirdness is past the tipping point. John for his part treats Jamies fiance Tim (Matt Walsh) as an annoying intruder into his John and Jamie-time. In Tims exasperation we see the reflection of Johns attitude toward Cyrus. This engaging provocative little movie is a reminder that sometimes the person that scares you most is the person most like you.

Share Tweet The writing-directing brother act of Jay and Mark Duplass were a breath of fresh air when they emerged from the micro-budget indie-film movement five years ago largely because their semi-improvised slacker comedies The Puffy Chair and Baghead actually aimed to entertain not just to document the quirks of inarticulate post-grads. Removed from their original contexts though--in competition with the whole of cinema not just a limited pool of regional festival fare--the Duplasses first two features dont impress as much. Both start off promisingly with strong characters a good germ of a plot and a few terrific scenes but they peter out before the end. The brothers third feature Cyrus charts much the same path only with name actors in the leading roles instead of the Duplass boys and their friends. Cyrus stars John C. Reilly as an irresponsible depressed loser whose life starts to look up when he meets sweet sexy Marisa Tomei. The problem is that Tomei lives with her son Jonah Hill who has no job doesnt go to school and talks to people with earnest tones and an almost-imperceptible sarcastic smirk. So Reilly and Hill engage in a battle for Tomeis heart through a series of passive-aggressive moves and counter-moves that play a lot like a Hollywood version of this story only with less snap--sort of like Step Brothers without the jokes. Theres some terrific character-defining detail in Cyrus as when Reilly tries to choose between a big or small box of condoms before his big date with Tomei. And theres something to be said for the idea of a naturalistic comedy about what happens when people prop up their weak friends and relatives for far too long. (Tomei and Hills relationship mirrors the one between Reilly and his ex-wife Catherine Keener which raises the question of whether Tomei only falls for Reilly because hes just like her son.) But once again with the Duplasses there just isnt enough of anything not enough funny lines not enough variation of mood not enough plot. If these guys were students Cyrus might merit a ""promising."" But this is their third movie. Its time for them to stop turning in first drafts.

Reilly and Catherine Keener are picture perfect in Cyrus (Chuck Zlotnick) A- Cyrus Genre Comedy; Starring Jonah Hill John C. Reilly Marisa Tomei Catherine Keener; Director Jay Duplass Mark Duplass; Author Jay Duplass Mark Duplass; Release Date Limited 06/18/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 92; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures Posted June 18 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT If you want to see a vital example of how the indie spirit can interface with Hollywood check out the spiky and surprising Cyrus. It stars John C. Reilly as John a big doofy slovenly and lovable middle-aged loser and Jonah Hill as Cyrus the blandly hostile and two-faced 21-year-old offspring of Johns new girlfriend Molly (Marisa Tomei) -- in other words the creepy clinging son from hell. The moment they meet with Cyrus putting on an expert show of bogus politeness the two men kick off an escalating war of wills. Since their rivalry is often quite funny you dont have to squint too hard to imagine the same scenario played out as a synthetically broad and cartoonish mainstream comedy (I can just imagine it with say Ben Stiller and Angus T. Jones). The filmmaking team of Jay and Mark Duplass clearly love those comedies. Yet they work with a rhythm and tone and a psychological fascination that are altogether more realistic -- closer in spirit to something the young Roman Polanski might have brought off. Cyrus may on some level be a stunt yet the Duplasses slightly sluggish low-budget mumblecore style allows this story to flower as both light-fingered lark and drama of suspenseful dysfunction. Cyrus who does nothing but hang out and compose spaced-out dance pop has never outgrown his mom (nor she him) and Hill with his deadpan parrot stare makes the kid a brilliantly manipulative head case; he plays Mollys sympathies like a virtuoso. John who knows that hes lucky to be with a woman this attractive is in the vulnerable spot but gradually he regains his power as a man a journey thats less vengeful than touching. Cyrus cues us to expect it to go over the top but the film never does. That may be its neatest trick.

Reilly plays John a middle-aged editor who lives like a stalled graduate student in his cluttered Los Angeles cottage. Thats where his former wife and close friend Jamie (Catherine Keener all aglow as ever) finds him masturbating to loud music when she drops in to tell him shes getting married again. Once he gets over his panic John lapses into his customary low-grade depression from which Jamie tries to rescue him by dragging him along with her long-suffering fiance (Matt Walsh) to a party. There he will make an utter fool of himself and take a risk that will change his life for the better--and much much worse.Warm loving and honest to a fault John is an ideal husband trapped in the awkward body of a superannuated boy. ""Im like Shrek"" this adorably homely man cries in wonder at the interest shown in him by Molly (Marisa Tomei) the only woman at the party who will give him the time of day. Few actresses in or out of Hollywood have moved into middle age more intelligently than Tomei--and without conceding the sweetly erotic sensuality that has made her such a blast all the way back to My Cousin Vinny. Without doing much of anything she makes us see how this glamorous opaquely sad fox might be charmed by Johns oafish candor. Its not long before John himself marveling at his luck but wondering why his first lover in seven years never invites him back to her house follows her home and finds out.As bad seeds go Mollys son Cyrus seems polite and innocuous enough at first. With his round staring blue eyes goldfish lips and unhelpful shirt stretched over a huge gut Jonah Hill looks as always like a slightly astonished honeydew melon. But the actor cannily dials down the schoolboy hysteria that has defined his persona in the Judd Apatow oeuvre into a lethally seditious calm that threatens to break any second. Co-dependent doesnt begin to describe the bond between Molly and Cyrus who is ""focusing"" on a ""music career"" largely confined to their cramped living room where he bangs out new-agey compositions on a synthesizer. ""Its great to have a new dad"" he tells John with imperturbable calm soon after theyve met then slides into the bathroom where his mother is taking a shower. By now youll be less surprised than John is to learn that Molly never fully closes her bedroom door even when theres company sleeping over.So begins a slow war of attrition as excruciatingly funny to watch as it is horrifying to be caught up in a face-off between a naive man who doesnt know what it means to play mind games a woman too smart not to know what she claims not to know and her son the emotional terrorist. Physically they make a wildly incongruous trio this tiny sexy woman her ungainly boyfriend and the humongous son who uses every tool in his repertoire to sabotage their romance. Yet nothing--not even the carving knife Cyrus holds in his fat paw when John stumbles upon him making a midnight sandwich--is overplayed in a movie that wanders teasingly along the border between sorrow and laughter.Jay and Mark Duplass whose enjoyably meandering first film The Puffy Chair was made for 15000 direct Cyrus. The brothers come loosely associated with the mumblecore movement membership in which so far as I can tell is determined by a blithe indifference to story structure. Known to employ a hair-raisingly improvisational shooting style the Duplasses shoot in chronological order altering the script as necessary and editing the footage they have at the end of each day. That Cyrus was made with Hollywood money (Ridley and Tony Scott neither famous for the experimental method are executive producers) and with big-name stars may account for the satisfying formal coherence of this hilarious often surprising movie.Cyrus may be a conniving monster but he isnt the only one here who needs to pry himself loose from an overly protective woman. How you read the ending of this wickedly ambiguous yet strangely tender parsing of modern relationships will depend to a degree on which genre you think the film falls into but far more on whether you think theres such a thing in this age of perpetual youth as a grown-up.

Think of ""Cyrus"" as the Duplasses for the masses as the keenly observant sibs upgrade their scrappy relationship-based formula to work with movie stars and a Fox Searchlight-size budget without sacrificing the raw naturalistic feel of their first two features ""The Puffy Chair"" and ""Baghead."" The duos latest study in interpersonal awkwardness takes its name from the only obstacle blocking a budding relationship between single-again fortysomethings John C. Reilly and Marisa Tomei Cyrus (a hilarious Jonah Hill) the co-dependent son unwilling to share his mothers attention. Expect this modest yet eminently commercial comedy to score the brothers more studio work. Above all this project allows Mark and Jay Duplass masters of the embarrassing moment to enlist A-list actors for their improv-based style; the co-directors provided their cast a rough script which the thesps are freely encouraged to personalize on camera. Though Reilly and Hill are no strangers to off-the-cuff comedy ad-libbing for directors such as Judd Apatow and Adam McKay the fact that ""Cyrus"" offers only the thinnest strand of a plot allows the Duplasses to be more focused in their direction. From the opening scene in which Jamie (Catherine Keener) walks in to find her ex-husband John (Reilly) in a compromising position to the constant string of surprises surrounding Cyrus character theres something refreshingly universal about the situations represented here. In many ways the success of a Duplass film is measured not in laughter but by how much the audience winces through scenes of uncomfortable recognition. The helmers specialize in passive-aggressive behavior unlocking truths long absent from scripted comedy simply by allowing their higher-def Red cameras to linger in closeup on how characters react to certain situations (too frequently ruptured by focal adjustments and mini-zooms that give everything a certain pseudo-amateur homemovie feel). Cyrus enters the picture not long after a memorable meet-cute between John and Molly (Tomei) and the fully grown kid is the very embodiment of festering resentment. Tomeis character requires that she remain oblivious to her sons manipulations but Reilly and Hill are free to cut loose and the results are wonderfully unpredictable. At first John doesnt know what to make of Cyrus though various clues indicate that the 21-year-old enjoys a highly unusual mother-son relationship. A photo in Mollys bedroom shows her breast-feeding Cyrus well past weaning age and several early scenes tease the squirmy possibility of incest. The fact is we dont know what their deal is and though John never seems to be in physical danger the well-calibrated suspense such ambiguity generates isnt so different from that of a horror movie. What makes these Duplassian experiments work is the way their characters are willing to share their feelings. At the end of the day these guys are mushy sentimentalists (as evidenced by a succession of heart-to-heart conversations between every possible pairing of John Molly and Cyrus) which means ""Cyrus"" promises a confrontation it cant possibly deliver. Still its Hills movie to steal. With his sad-sack posture and chilly glare Cyrus looks like one of those Aardman creations whose every blink earns a chuckle. The films semi-scripted approach may deprive the character of catchphrases but auds wont be forgetting him anytime soon.

By David Denby Russell Brand and Jonah Hill in a movie directed by Nicholas Stoller.   Credit Illustration by Rachel Domm In the brazenly funny ""Get Him to the Greek"" a Los Angeles music company gives one of its low-level employees a perilous task. Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) a polite rotund young man has to collect the once great now wasted rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from London and haul him to L.A. There at the Greek Theatre Aldous is scheduled to reprise a famous concert of ten years earlier--the company reasons that a comeback is something it can exploit. But Aldous has grown wary of performing and when Aaron shows up at his luxe apartment on the Thames he sizes him up as a nobody and starts to mess with him. He blows off flights rampages through pubs and gets the increasingly distraught Aaron drunk and most uncomfortably laid in the W.C. of a club. ""Greek"" is the story of how Aaron nevertheless gains control of his mission while Aldous stirred by Aarons decency and appalled by his own vacuousness begins to find some sort of core around which to rebuild himself. ""Greek"" was produced by Judd Apatow--the plot is Apatovian in its mixture of barbarity and tenderness--and there are many connections to earlier Apatow pictures. For a start Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller spun the characters out of their Apatow-produced movie ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" in which Brand first appeared as Aldous Snow and Hill played a waiter trying to impress him. For Stoller who directed both movies and wrote ""Greek"" the new movie is an enormous leap beyond that rather flabby comedy. Aaron is assaulted by nothing less than the past five decades of rock life concentrated distilled and savagely parodied. The movies story is conventional in shape but it has passages of crazy exhilaration and brilliant invention. Brand provides most of the fireworks. Anarchic nasty and unnervingly intelligent his Aldous has extraordinary reserves of energy and an endless repertory of temperaments and moods. Theres some real-world basis for this. Brand has been through a lot. He has joked about his childhood (he claims that his first words were ""Dont do that"") and at various times in his life he has been a drama student (expelled) a standup comic a radio host an alcoholic a heroin addict ""Shagger of the Year"" a soccer fan and columnist and an author. Apatow has said that ""Aldous is actually a toned-down version of Russell."" When we get our first glimpse of Brand in ""Sarah Marshall"" he looks like some sort of previously undiscovered wild animal. He has fiery dark eyes thickly draped black locks a dazzling snarl. In both movies he wears his shirt open to mid-chest and his pants skintight; hes both a strutting stud and a sendup of one over the top yet not too far over. Beneath the flamboyance is a frightened man on the verge of panic. ""Greek"" opens with a classic spoof. We see guerrillas firing at one another in a burning African village. What are these scary images? It turns out that theyre a music video and from the flames steps a tall figure white-robed and bearded Aldous playing Christ and staring beatifically at the camera. ""African child . . . trapped in me"" he moans as the battle seethes behind him. The song ""African Child"" came out a few years ago and was pounced on by critics as one of the worst calamities to befall the continent since plague and famine. Stoller gives us a rapid trek through Aldouss subsequent career disasters mocking magazine covers snarky Web sites hapless cable interviews. The filmmakers have caught the joyfully vicious tone of the celebrity culture in one of its periodic fits of contempt for an idol it had deliriously created. Aldous has a match of sorts in his ex-girlfriend Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) a British model turned singer her eyes decorated with teardrop glitter. We see some of her videos which are semi-obscene talentless provocations; the lame shock tactics are the only way that she can pitch herself to the public. Aldous and Jackie talk to each other in a drug-dazed filthy Brit babble that sounds like a degraded new stylization of speech. Theyre emptied out. Stoller has a terrific satirical ear for music-business bluster and sycophancy as well as for inane rock lyrics. Aarons boss Sergio Roma (Sean Combs) the head of Pinnacle Records subjects his staff to scathing tirades. (Combss comic timing is devastating; he should do more acting.) But he advises Aaron to flatter and even enable the hard-drinking rocker. How else can you control him? ""Party these Limey fucks to the ground"" is his considered advice. For stretches ""Greek"" with its music-world allusions and celebrity cameos moves recklessly fast. The party scenes jump ahead in the kind of quick-flash montage that I usually hate but I was amazed by how many scabrous and piquant details Stoller packs into each shot. Then the action collapses into exhaustion and disgust. Aaron parties Aldous to the ground all right but in Los Angeles Aldous invades the bed that Aaron shares with his girlfriend Daphne (Elisabeth Moss) a young doctor which is a little too close to the ground for Aarons taste. Apatow and his gang have turned hefty round-faced Jewish boys like Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen into romantic leads. That may be an outrage against the perfection of say Errol Flynn but one that we can be grateful for. At first Hill relies on the huffy hyperarticulateness that he has used in other roles but he calms down as the movie goes along. Aaron Green can handle Aldous Snow but hes disappointed when the rocker lonely and worn out lapses into self-pity. Aaron needs Aldous to be a hero just as Mark Linn-Baker needed a Flynn-like actor played by Peter OToole to be a hero in the lovely ""My Favorite Year"" back in 1982. ""Greek"" is a successor to that movie and to Apatows recent ""Funny People"" which was about the dark side of a life in comedy. The dark side of rock is a lot crazier but for Aldous performing again brings the elements of his scattered existence together. Apatovian comedy is both wild and firmly grounded; it surges into chaotic liberation and misadventure while longing for the bonds of loyalty friendship family and vocation. Every man in his own way has to return home. Jonah Hill turns up again in ""Cyrus"" but whereas in ""Greek"" he wears his hair in its customary fleecy aureole with a shadow of music-industry stubble here hes as clean-shaven as a deacon and his hair is tightly cropped. The change has the effect of making his eyes seem more pronounced his bulk larger his personality more aggressive. As Cyrus a twenty-one-year-old living with his single mother Molly (Marisa Tomei) Hill makes his lugubrious body work for him as a shield against experience. Cyrus has no interest in attracting girls; hes a nonsexual boy cloistered with the woman who raised him and whom he adores. At home with her he composes New Agey music on a flotilla of synthesizers. This possessive recluse is often unlikable but never stupid. Molly a generous-souled woman takes up with a forlorn long-divorced fellow John (John C. Reilly) and Cyrus who sees his hold over her threatened tries to break up the affair with lies guilt trips and mock breakdowns. Our sympathies of course lie with the lover. Reilly who has curly brown hair and rubbery features shreds his usual baffled sexlessness; his John begins to fight while Molly just tries to make everyone happy. ""Cyrus"" was written and directed by the brothers Jay and Mark Duplass who started out working in whats loosely called the mumblecore movement with no-budget pictures like ""The Puffy Chair"" (an absurdist road movie that turns serious about the end of a love affair) and ""Baghead"" (a kind of ""Blair Witch Project"" homage). This is their first film made with established actors and a decent budget yet they keep to their earlier aesthetic. They avoid the flash and the speed of commercial movies moving in close with a handheld camera and staying close as characters try to work out their confusion. The steady embrace of the actors produces intimate character details and awkward moments that land lightly with a touch of off-kilter humor. But the Duplasses have put themselves in a paradoxical situation the story of a sexually hungry boyfriend struggling against his lovers creepy son has the built-in volatility of a commercial-movie premise. When Cyrus and John square off the Duplass brothers might have turned in one of two directions toward wild comedy or toward anguish and rage. Theres a dose of the latter but the rage is quickly smothered in niceness and the movie becomes tame. Avoiding commercial formulas and whipped-up moods isnt enough to make a work of art. The Duplasses sensitivity which is genuine yields too much tepid relationship-speak and Marisa Tomei one of the most appealing actresses in Hollywood is left with little to play. The characterization of Molly as a sexy Earth Mother who cant speak her own mind is vapid and condescending as if she werent as real to the filmmakers as the two men are. The Duplass brothers rebellion might really take off if they put women at the center of it.
