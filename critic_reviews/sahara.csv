Part of a privately funded ocean-going operation salvaging valuable artefacts Pitt is scientist historian and fearless rabble-rouser rolled into one. Think two parts Indiana Jones to one part James Bond - the filmmakers evidently did. Unfortunately it took them to the vapid presence of Matthew McConaughey who plays it so unbearably superciliously cool throughout that you could quite happily throttle him.That handicap aside its not unintriguing fare up to a point. We start at the close of the American Civil War when a Confederate iron-clad battleship is crawling out of port under heavy fire never to be seen again until the discovery of a rare gold coin in present-day sub-Saharan Africa prompts McConaughey to conclude that the vessel is now languishing somewhere in the desert. The four credited screenwriters take some care to set up vaguely recognisable geographical and political realities as the search intersects with Penelope Cruzs World Health Organisation doctor racing to prevent the spread of a deadly virus and suave Gallic magnate Lambert Wilson helping the local tinpot dictator with his chemical waste processing. With striking landscape photography by Seamus McGarvey and Steve Zahns goofball sidekick turn amiable as ever it tootles along merrily enough until we hit a 007-retread final reel the CGI kicks in and rigid tedium takes over. Standard-issue family action-adventure fare then with only the odd dash of early 70s rock (Lynyrd Skynyrd et al) hinting at any distinctive flavour and the vacuous leading man clearly a liability.

David Leans epic made such a gorgeous symphony out of that arid wilderness no other movies could ever hope to reprise its magic. Although the desert has a certain power in such films as ""The English Patient"" and ""Three Kings"" its never been the same since Peter OToole and Omar Sharif hut-hutted their camels across the Nefu. But that hasnt stopped ""Sahara."" The story based on a novel from the Dirk Pitt series by Clive Cussler is about a missing ironclad battleship from the Civil War era that has obsessed master explorer Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) for most of his life. Always determined to find evidence that the battleship took a one-way voyage to Africa Dirk and his ""quippy sidekick"" Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) get their opportunity when they are working off the African coast for a marine agency leader Adm. James Sandecker (William H. Macy). Matthew McConaughey Penelope Cruz and Steve Zahn find arid adventure in ""Sahara."" (Keith Hamshere) _____More in Movies_____  Sahara National Showtimes  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now When Dirk saves Eva Rojas (Cruz) from Nigerian marauders a friendship begins. It turns out Rojas is a World Health Organization physician trying to track the cause of a mysterious affliction affecting people along the Niger River. Of course their agendas and destinies converge -- in this case in the desert of Mali when all three find themselves fighting an autocratic African general who is exploiting natural resources and killing the Tuareg tribe. ""Sahara"" is pretty much an excuse for McConaughey (one of several executive producers) to flex his gym-toned assets and play tough on boats trains and camels. (For equal-opportunity ogling ""Sahara"" is also a chance to appreciate Cruzs sultry pulchritude but there are better Penelope movies for that.) But despite a plethora of high-action chases gun battles boat battles and the various exotic locales McConaughey remains more buffed than compelling. Hes not helped by a two-hour convolution of episodes that are too busy imitating other better movies to think about doing something interesting of their own. ""Sahara"" apes elements from ""Lawrence of Arabia."" It even steals a little James Bond business for its score. And it tries to reprise unsuccessfully the witty zest of the Indiana Jones series. Unfortunately McConaugheys no Harrison Ford. And no one cracks the whip of originality. If youre still anxious to see this movie bring a lot of water wear a sunproof headdress and be sure to tell your friends where you are. The desert can be a lonely place. SAHARA (PG-13 124 minutes) -- Contains action violence. Area theaters.

Its based on the dubious proposition that Matthew McConaughey is uniquely charming and charismatic. His attractiveness however seems to consist of a vulpine leer and a mass of tendrilly blond hair and eyes that beam with self-adoration. He is very fond of the cut muscles in his arms and one suspects he anticipates that all of us will be as well. Not my idea of a movie star but then ""Sahara"" isnt my idea of a movie. Penelope Cruz Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn are a bunch of clueless gold diggers in ""Sahara."" (Keith Hamshere -- Paramount Via AP) _____More in Movies_____  Sahara National Showtimes  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At least in general terms its the one in which a gang of wacky Western quipsters show up in Africa which they barely notice and race around having a whale of a time while pretending to care about the ecology and the people even if theyre really looking for gold. Almost nothing works. McConaughey is paired with two love interests Penelope Cruz and hippie-dippie Steve Zahn giving what has sadly turned out after a promising start to be his only trope -- the disorganized slightly panicky flower child. Cruz is a World Health Organization doc on the prowl for a plague in sub-Saharan Africa -- Morocco stands in for Mali -- while buddies Mac and Z play marine salvage experts Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino ex-SEALs obsessed with the idea that a Confederate ironclad laden with gold somehow ended far up the Niger. All three throw together for an upriver trek along with assorted expendables who are quickly enough taken care of. For a PG-13 movie by the way the body count is high and the violence surprisingly abundant. The three principals appear not to care about each other and have almost no chemistry at all -- possibly Cruz and McConaughey saved it for when the camera is off as they are now engaged. Worse you never see them think. Their eyes remain empty throughout and the movie lacks the charm and cleverness of ""National Treasure"" of last summer its forerunner in the fit-for-the-whole-family sweepstakes. As the movie works it out -- after its finished stereotyping black African dictators noble Muslim guerrillas French Eurotrash the CIA -- the ultimate heart of darkness proves to be corrupt Western technology which our two-man-one-woman commando team decide to blow and then not blow. That is when they are not looking for the Confederate ironclad or exchanging wisecracks wholly lacking in either wisdom or crackle. Much of the blame for that must fall on the 34-year-old director Breck Eisner son of Disneys Michael Eisner. (Breck made this picture for Paramount where dad used to work.) I suppose what annoys me most other than the lack of invention is the movies complete lack of interest in Africa. This is a great tragic tapestry of a land and one of the most profound experiences a Westerner can have. (Ive been twice.) To the bozos on-screen Africas just a lot of sand and you know poor people. Sahara (127 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 and has a great deal of knife gun and explosion violence.

Photo by Keith Hamshere less SAHRA08 Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz left) Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey center) and Al Giordino (Steve Zahn right) celebrate after an unexpected victory in Paramount Pictures/Bristol Bay Productions ... more Adventurers all dried up in the desert 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Sahara Adventure. Starring Matthew McConaughey Steve Zahn and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Breck Eisner. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Anybody who wants to know whats wrong with todays movies need look no further than ""Sahara"" an adventure in mediocrity that brings together some of the worst current techniques and trends. This one has everything stereotyped characters shaky camera work absurdly inappropriate pop songs on the soundtrack a confused tone misplaced zaniness and a nonsensical story. The clear intention was to make a romp something fun and casual full of genuine laughs and thrills. But ""Sahara"" doesnt romp or stomp it just plods and theres nothing genuine in it. Even the action sequences lie dead which is curious since theyre competently filmed. Obviously its not the staging of the scenes thats the problem but everything besides the staging. Director Breck Eisner employs a light tone that distances the audience even as hes trying to engage it and the story construction is so weak that the picture is almost impossible to take seriously. ""Sahara"" may go down in history as the first feature to begin with a gratuitous Civil War battle. Its a naval battle in which an ironclad Union ship withstands a barrage of Confederate fire. The battle has nothing to do with the movie except that the ironclad in question is of interest to modern- day adventurer Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) who believes the ship later sank off the coast of Africa in 1866. He wants to find it on the bottom of the ocean. Thats just what adventurers do. In between sessions of lifting weights and teeth-bleaching they come up with useless ways to pass the time. Meanwhile in a completely unrelated development Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) a doctor from the World Health Organization has detected an outbreak of a deadly plague in North Africa. She wants to find the source of the plague but to do that she has to cross into a war-torn area and the local warlord is determined to keep her out. Usually an action-adventure comes up with a strong reason for the protagonist to take action. ""Sahara"" splits our focus by giving us two protagonists and then it screws up further by giving neither of them a strong enough motivation. That Eva wants to do something about the plague is commendable but with a warlord against her she has no chance of success. She cant cure a plague on her own and her insistence on going in anyway just seems like suicidal stubbornness. (Stubbornness is the default female trait in bad movies always offered as an example of strength.) Meanwhile Dirks reasons for searching for the ironclad seem like sheer frivolity. Maybe it worked better in the Clive Cussler novel upon which the movie is based. Just one example of how lazy and clumsy the plotting is. At one point Dr. Rojas and her party are attacked in the desert by the warlords troops. Well guess what? Dirk and his buddy Al (Steve Zahn) happen to be in the same desert in the same place at the same time. Isnt that lucky? So Dirk and Al get in on the fight killing all those nasty soldiers. Thats very nice for Dr. Rojas but from the audiences point of view it doesnt necessarily reflect well on Dirk and Al. Where do these guys get off killing people? Its not their fight. Its not their country. Maybe they just enjoy gun battles. Maybe racking up native corpses is part of what they consider a complete day. Eisner who is Disney honcho Michael Eisners son tries to instill in ""Sahara"" a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-like insouciance but light tones are tricky. Theres never at any moment a concern that Dirk and Al wont survive. Theyre practically bulletproof and they act like it. In fact they act almost like happy idiots and that becomes a problem The action scenes are robbed of tension and the very real damage they inflict on others becomes distasteful. However there is one good action moment in the movie involving a cannon ball. That cannon ball and McCon-augheys gleaming white teeth are the movies chief assets. One more thing After ""Sahara"" it might be a good idea to retire the song ""Sweet Home Alabama"" for everything but movies about sweet Alabama homes. And Steppenwolfs ""Magic Carpet Ride"" should be banned entirely from movie soundtracks even in movies about magic carpets. Move on. Its time to find some other songs. -- Advisory Violence and the threat of violence.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Matthew McConaughey Clive Cussler Penelope Cruz or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- While ""Sahara"" doesnt even come close to living up to the gold standard of its action-adventure genre -- that is the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise -- its satisfying entertainment.Sure it goes on too long but its been beautifully shot on location in north and west Africa and -- surprise -- features excellent performances by all the main players.Matthew McConaughey (who is also one of the films four executive producers) plays master explorer Dirk Pitt who -- along with his comic sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) -- is on a quest to find an ironclad American Civil War-era battleship that has somehow found its way to the Sahara desert. (The movie is based on a novel by Clive Cussler known for plots of improbable but enjoyable derring-do.)Both men work for NUMA -- the National Underwater and Marine Agency -- headed by Admiral Sandecker played by William H. Macy usually found snapping off David Mamet dialogue (""Spartan"") or playing weighted-down sad sacks (""Magnolia"" ""The Cooler""). In ""Sahara"" Macys cool calibrated performance gives heft to whats otherwise a rather fanciful tale and provides a realistic anchor for all the rascals warlords and rogues who inhabit the rest of the flick.Early in their search for the mysterious ship Al and Dirk meet a beautiful and highly dedicated doctor Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) working for the World Health Organization. Shes on her own mission to find the source of a deadly disease killing hundreds of people across a vast area in the Sahara.As their journeys merge the three discover that toxic chemicals are causing the deaths. It seems that the toxins are being spread by an underground river -- the last known location of the ironclad ship.Heroes and villainsOf course there are villains.Most notable -- and most one-dimensional -- is a nasty and heavily armed African warlord General Kazim (Lennie James) with his own agenda regarding the chemicals disposal. If he gets his way the toxins could eventually effect the eco-system of the entire world. McConaughey and Cruz hit it off in ""Sahara."" They hit it off in real life as well.You never doubt that Kazim is going to get his however. The character is written so broadly hes a major weak spot in the film.Theres also a French corporation man played by Lambert Wilson who has good intentions but ends up down the wrong path.Fortunately the films strengths lie in the chemistry between the three main characters and the popcorn-chomping pacing of director Breck Eisner son of controversial Disney head Michael. Its Eisners first feature film and though he and his team have taken some major liberties with the original material -- including changing the ending -- the books spirit remains intact.Smooth rhythmsMcConaughey and Zahn develop -- and manage to maintain -- a wonderful well-oiled rhythm between their characters. Dirk is always ""the man with a plan"" and Al helps him succeed again and again.Then along comes Eva. Often in this type of film the brainy/sexy babe is reduced to an awkwardly pasted on appendage but Cruz elevates Eva with her solid acting talents and fits into this boys club with a breezy confidence and ease.It also helps that her character gets to save the day from time to time -- all without breaking even one perfectly manicured fingernail.The movie is also greatly enhanced by the mesmerizing desert landscapes of Morocco captured to great effect by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (""The Hours"").The music featuring both original scoring and some great old standards such as Steppenwolfs late-60s ""Magic Carpet Ride"" offer a bit of whimsy to the story.Sure ""Sahara"" is a popcorn flick. But its a well-executed popcorn flick. Whatever it lacks in substance it makes up for in gloss humor and thrills and a good time should be had by all.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Points to promising B.O. in the U.S. and abroad. Saddled with more industry/celebrity baggage than a high-class safari voyage ""Sahara"" is a rousing and only occasionally ridiculous adventure yarn that craftily updates and condenses author Clive Cusslers Dirk Pitt thriller to assume that auds actually know something about Africa and the global environment. Pitts slightly Quixotic quest for a missing Confederate ironclad ship intersects with a race to stop a toxic catastrophe in West and Saharan Africa -- to say nothing of evil Malian warlords nasty French corporate thieves and a U.N. doctor full of derring-do -- and the combination points to more promising B.O. in the U.S. and abroad than might have been expected. The real test will be if the independently financed 100 million production draws numbers that compel Dirk Pitt sequels even though theres nothing in pics denouement that contains the built-in expectations of another episode. The first test has already been passed Whether theres enough onscreen to make one forget that the director is Breck (son of Michael) Eisner in his feature debut; that Cussler has taken the producers to court claiming that an unauthorized version of the script was lensed; that theres no way to condense Cusslers massive 700-page-plus tome into two hours; and that co-stars Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz fell in love on the set. None of this matters it turns out since the adaptation of the novel briskly and wittily brings the action and characters together and makes African politics and social conditions a very real backdrop for antics that make Pitt (McConaughey) a younger-generation Indiana Jones. Even more encouraging as father Michaels exec star is fading Breck Eisner shows himself to be a solid helmer of complex and beautifully staged action sequences with a sure ear for character interplay and an exact eye for glorious widescreen framing with nods to images from ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Prelude during the 1865 Union siege of Richmond Va. briefly but explosively traces how the last remaining Confederate ironclad the Texas managed to slip beyond Northern cannons on the James River. Swift transitions between this fine set piece a title sequence that neatly establishes Dirks work as a treasure hunter and his lifelong friendship with Al Giordano (Steve Zahn) and a swooping camera entry into Lagos Nigeria indicate this is a movie on a mission. In Lagos World Health Organization doc Ana Rojas (Cruz) and assistant Frank (Glynn Turman) are hunting for the source of what appears to be a plague breakout somewhere along the Niger River. She is prey herself as a hooded man clearly wants her dead until Dirk comes to the rescue in an effectively dizzying scene that avoids the meet-cute cliches. Ana finds herself aboard a vessel commanded by Admiral Sandecker (William H. Macy) and operated by the National Underwater Marine Agency (NUMA) but Dirks the star of the ship proudly salvaging an ancient Nigerian reliquary. Within minutes Ana has bonded with Dirk shady corporate sponsor Yves Massarde has made his presence felt Al has shown why hes never going to be the guy who gets the girl and a gold Confederate coin has suddenly appeared and spurred Dirk into action. Convinced that the coins presence in West Africa means the Texas must be near Dirk commands one of the admirals spiffy speedboats and takes Al and nerdy cohort Rudi (Rainn Wilson) along for the ride. Mechanically ""Sahara"" is as sleek as the admirals boat hurtling along from one expertly shot (by Seamus McGarvey) and edited (by Andrew MacRitchie) action set piece to another with just enough time-outs for brief but suitable character developments and insights to generate a strong sense of urgency to the heroes efforts. Unfortunately Cusslers nagging habit for having the white man rescue the black man overwhelms the story for a long stretch. Balancing the gravitas of a story about the dire ecological threat of toxic waste is the light and frolicsome banter and near-escapes enjoyed by Dirk and Al whose usual greeting before the action starts is the disarming ""Hi How ya doin?"" McConaughey and Zahn work like a fine double-play combination the star regularly stepping back so the sidekick can have his moment. Surprisingly (especially for fans of the lovebirds) McConaughey and Cruz rarely have a quiet moment together and never steam up the lens in this PG-13 outing playing characters driven to do their job first and fool around later. Firmly slated as Hollywoods first choice for Euro-baddies Wilson actually expresses shock at the eco-havoc his greed could unleash thinking all along that he could generate solar power by burning the mucky waste and make money at the same time. Hes a bad man with good intentions which is more than can normally be expected from a popcorn programmer just as it is to see Africans rid themselves of one of their worst. Its fair to expect ultra-pro production values that the pic packs but to see Africa taken even halfway seriously on the bigscreen is a real thrill.

Overheated Matthew McConaughey left Penelope Cruz and Steve Zahn star in this Dirk Pitt adventure based on Clive Cusslers novel. Paramount Pictures Its as if director Breck Eisner (son of Disney chief Michael) realized two-thirds through that more excitement was needed and then ladled it on thick. The buddy action-adventure morphs into a disaster flick and just for kicks both good and bad guys detonate as many explosions as might have gone off during a week of the Iraq war. (Related video Watch the Sahara trailer) Reason and logic are blown away as well. Characters traverse the Sahara on foot for days and never seem to need a drop of water as they pull off amazing feats. They also happen upon a working pay phone after stumbling through miles of barren terrain. About the movie Sahara   (out of four) Stars Matthew McConaughey Steve Zahn Penelope Cruz William H. Macy Director Breck Eisner Distributor Paramount Pictures Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor and some sensuality Opens Friday nationwide But at least this movie has the sense to cast the goofy Steve Zahn who utters the movies only funny lines. A plan to release poison into the water supply of western Africa is exposed and threatens the Atlantic. Treasure-hunter/ scientist Matthew McConaughey -- a swashbuckling good ol boy -- asks Zahn ""What would you do if you were exposed as the worlds worst polluter?"" Zahn cracks ""Run for president?"" Penelope Cruz in one of her least convincing performances plays a World Health Organization doctor who believes she has discovered a deadly plague in Mali when actually a nefarious local warlord is poisoning the water supply. Cruz is supposed to be feisty and dedicated but mostly she looks wide-eyed and out of place. To convince cynics of her medical skill and moxie she dons thick glasses and gamely fires a gun when the opportunity arises. McConaughey and Zahn are explorers bent on finding a sunken Civil War battleship which they believe drifted over to Africa. (Dont ask.) Childhood pals they now work for a former Navy admiral played by William H. Macy who brings some sorely needed intelligence to the proceedings. When Cruzs life is threatened and the potential ecological disaster exposed the roguish pair spring into hero mode. Sahara is a testosterone-drenched escapade that misses because it lacks the tension to make it a thrill ride. Never do you doubt that key characters will survive various perils. The film clocks in at under two hours but the last 20 minutes feel like 40. In the interminable climax Zahn whines ""Im so tired of being shot at."" Not nearly as tired as his audience.

"Sahara | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sahara ) Sahara (United States/Spain 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Sahara takes the action/adventure story to new heights of preposterousness. In a way thats not a bad thing since it allows a certain level of guilty enjoyment. Youre never expected to take anything in the movie seriously because the characters and filmmakers dont. Theyre constantly directing knowing winks and nods at the audience as if to reassure us that they know the story is stupid but hey dumb can be fun sometimes. And there are times during Sahara when this approach works. Maybe 50 minutes worth of times. The problem? The movie is 127 minutes long. Sahara feels like it was cobbled together from discarded pieces of National Treasure and Raiders of the Lost Ark. To its credit this one is more enjoyable than the former film because the action sequences are (for the most part) energetic and occasionally show flashes of originality. Unfortunately when comparing it to even the weakest of the Indiana Jones movies it fails to measure up. None of those films took themselves seriously either but they nevertheless developed characters worth caring about and provided stories that sucked us in (instead of just sucked). Sahara is so busy proclaiming its silliness that we never get a feel for the characters or believe on any level in their circumstances. This is an exercise in bad plotting ripe dialogue and semi-impressive stunts. There are times when Sahara threatens to put its audience to sleep. The film is top-heavy with exposition. In fact it takes 40 minutes before we get to the first major action sequence. After that they come fairly regularly throughout the rest of the movie but there are still significant breaks in between. And when the characters arent fighting or dodging bullets they are wandering around and talking. The dialogue is so cheesy that it has to be intentional. Theres no other way to explain a line like ""He put the war back in warlord."" All of this filler serves to pad out the movie to an unnecessary two-plus hours. A tighter script would have done a better job staving off bouts of boredom. As it is were stuck with a movie thats about 40% low-brow enjoyment and 60% tedium. The films main characters are treasure hunters Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) a couple of wild and crazy guys who have known each other from kindergarten and pretty much spent every waking moment of their lives together - school the military and now their ""adult"" jobs working for an archeological society. Dirks pet project is discovering the location of a lost Civil War iron boat that he believes to have made it across the Atlantic to Africa. When he discovers a clue to its possible whereabouts hes off in pursuit. Tagging along is Eva Rojas a doctor for the World Heath Organization who is looking for the source of a new plague. Her destination - somewhere in the Sahara - is roughly the same as the guys so they team up. The bad guys for the record are a wealthy industrialist (Lambert Wilson) and an inhumane dictator (Lennie James). Theyre covering things up and when our intrepid heroes get too close to the truth things get dangerous. We are supposed to assume that some sort of relationship develops between Dirk and Eva but the chemistry between real-life couple McConaughey and Cruz is so feeble that its easier to believe that their characters are just pals. Human dynamics to the extent that there are any are quickly cast aside when we are asked to contemplate the concept of an 1860s floating war boat buried under a sand dune in the middle of a desert. Oddly thats not even the biggest leap of logic Sahara asks us to make. Theres something about the exaggerated impact of leaking toxic substances that will make even the most devout environmentalist chortle. This is the kind of movie where talented actors like to slum because it means a good paycheck and not a lot of effort. Im referring to Delroy Lindo who plays the obligatory CIA agent and William H. Macy who is Dirks employer. Macy is a stabilizing influence bringing to Sahara what he brought to Cellular. He gets his share of laughs although not as many as Steve Zahn. McConaughey looking buff but failing to make us accept him as an action hero is not impressive and Cruz is a black hole. She lacks screen presence. Director Breck Eisener (his father Michael must have a shampoo fetish) makes the leap here from music videos to feature films. Although he gives us some nice moments and shows aptitude when it comes to generating suspense within an action sequence he needs to learn a little more about pacing. It should not take a movie of this sort 1/3 of its running time before we get to the first 007-inspired chase sequence. (Anyone else notice that the music sounds like it was borrowed from John Barry?) The film is ""based on"" a novel by Clive Cussler. Reportedly those who have read the book are trying to figure out whether there are any similarities other than the title and the names of the characters. This is a Mystery Science Theater 3000 special. Its not the sort of movie you see in a theater (despite the Lawrence of Arabia-inspired sandscapes). Instead the ingredients to derive maximum enjoyment include a copy on DVD plenty of beer and a group of quick-witted friends. By the end of an evening in those circumstances you may think Sahara is one of the best films of 2005. Otherwise you may wonder why you bothered.

Macy Steve Zahn; Director Breck Eisner; Author Thomas Donnelly James V. Hart Joshua Oppenheimer John C. Richards; Release Date Wide 04/08/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 127; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted April 6 2005 -- 1200 AM EDT Even a Clive Cussler newbie who wouldnt know prototypical Cussler adventurer Dirk Pitt from prototypical porno adventurer Dirk Diggler will know that somethings odd about Dirk as played by Matthew McConaughey in the lunar tract of action geography called Sahara. For one thing isnt Dirk -- the daring resourceful fun-loving life-guzzling world-traveling deep-sea-treasure-hunting hero of so many Cussler novels -- supposed to have a personality? For another did Cussler really specify that Pitts desert head scarves should match his Aegean blue eyes at all times? Id wager that the answers are yes and no. This insanely busy exceedingly long and sometimes endearingly preposterous rendering has simply gotten the directions reversed in its insistence on sticking only to where men-who-make-adventure-flicks have gone before. Operating on the assumption that the globe-hopping plot works by itself -- heck keeping up with the itinerary is logistical challenge enough -- the four-man writing team and dashingly named director Breck Eisner invest all their bombastic energy in maneuvering the players from A to Z This is a story that opens on an ironclad battleship off the coast of Virginia during the Civil War and ends in the deserts of Mali (scenery courtesy of Morocco) in a toxic nuclear-waste site operated by a greedy (and for good measure French) industrialist played by all-purpose French villain Lambert Wilson. In between as Dirk and his indispensable joke-cracking never-gets-the-girl best friend and wingman Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) poke around looking for a lost ironclad fabled to have drifted to Africa brilliant World Health Organization doctor Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz flattened by the Hollywood steamroller) is also nosing around Africa looking to contain and treat a possible plague; she doesnt let a mask cover her Cover Girl beauty but at least she occasionally tugs on latex gloves. Dirk meets Eva cute when he rescues her from an attempted assassination and the two beam their magnificent white teeth at one another in a semaphore of pulchritude. Dirk meets not-so-handsome warlords. Eva meets tribal chieftains. Al makes jokes. Dirk and Eva find the common denominator in their separate adventure agendas. Dirk and Als eccentric avuncular boss Admiral Sandecker (William H. Macy) shows up to worry about his employees. Personality? Chemistry? A sense of real moviemaking delight in the wanton bravado of Cusslers La-Z-Boy-thrill derring-do? In Sahara theyve all been reduced to Zahns charming moments as a second-banana action hero. Every now and then Al flashes Dirk a grin that says ""Yeah fine that head scarf looks good on you. Now cant we please have some fun?""
