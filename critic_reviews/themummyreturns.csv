(Keith Hamshere/Universal) The curse of the sequels befalls ""The Mummy Returns"" the first silly special-effects-laden adventure of the summer season. Even though its only early May the time has come to take off those thinking caps and get ready for the overblown the crass and the inane. About a decade has passed since we first laid eyes on theswashbuckling lunk Rick (affable Brendan Fraser) and the brainy Egyptologist Evelyn (feisty Rachel Weisz) who are now married and living in London with their 9-year-old son Alex (Freddie Boath). One day the erstwhile mummy-busters are just about to break out the scones when they are called back to the relentless action. The evil priest Imhotep (sneering Arnold Vosloo) is no longer under wraps. Hes been resurrected and stalks the Earth once more. It seems the curator of the British Museum and his evil minions have roused the 3000-year-old menace from his sarcophagus. And as before the miffed and moldering corpse sets out to regain immortality and of course conquer the world (why would anybody want to?). But first he must retrieve the Bracelet of Anubis and find his lover Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez) who has been reincarnated as a modern-day grave-robber. After fighting off a bunch of special effects Evelyn and Rick head for Egypt to keep the bad guys (evil Shriners judging by their red fezzes) from summoning the Scorpion King (played by the Rock that cable TV wrestler) a fearsome warrior whose soul belongs to the god Anubis and should be left the hell alone. But noooo. If Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun can whip the Scorpion King they will inherit Anubiss army and if Evelyn and Rick can locate the Oasis of Ahm Shere . . . Still with me? I thought not Writer-director Stephen Sommerss impenetrable flashback-hampered plot is as twisted as Cleopatras asp. And it lacks the old-fashioned charms of the original movie -- the characters are as bloodless as King Tut. And no wonder the actors spend most of their time looking awestruck and running away from miniature bug armies that chase them around the pyramids. Yes many of the visual effects are stunning but others are downright cheesy -- especially an attempt to fuse the Rocks head onto a scorpions body. It looks as if it was pasted on by a first-grader. The action sequences are just as uneven and repetitious. Stevie Sommers has been a bad bad boy. Somebody sic ""Mummy Dearest"" on him.The Mummy Returns (129 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sensuality and some language.

USATODAY.com - The Mummy returns to great effect Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/11/2001 - Updated 0233 PM ET The Mummy returns to great effect By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY The Mummy Returns (out of four) Stars Brendan Fraser Rachel Weisz Arnold Vosloo Oded Fehr Director Stephen Sommers Distributer Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for adventure action and violence In a movie year so depressingly devoid of any creative ambition the old-fashioned yet newfangled thrills of The Mummy Returns arrive in the nick of time.Sure the adventure fantasy has more than the occasional leap in logic but its easy to overlook plot holes when your eyes are being boggled. Director/writer Stephen Sommers and the sorcerers at Industrial Light amp; Magic have smoothed the kinks from the 1999 original in a less bombastic sequel. Read more Stories The Rock wrestles with movie action The Rocks smashes stereotypes A second helping of Mummy magic Video Mummy Returns trailer Photo Gallery Wrestling for stardom Hot summer in the cinema Rather than an oppressive assault on the senses these state-of-the-art effects carry the high-camp stamp of Cecil B. De Mille and the playful even cheesy Saturday-matinee spirit of stop-motion wizard Ray Harryhausen. Evoking Harryhausens sword-wielding skeletons are lethal legions of canine soldiers and pesky hordes of pygmy mummies. Instead of his snaky Medusa you get the Scorpion King with lobster claws crab legs and the chiseled torso of wrestling icon the Rock. When a tidal wave gushes forth its a water rush of biblical proportions a la De Mille. Too bad the weakest link in this perpetual-motion loop-de-loop that barrels along like the boulder from Raiders of the Lost Ark remains the mummy himself. Arnold Vosloos reconstituted corpse Imhotep still comes in two not-very-savory flavors a digital crispy critter and after sucking the life force out of his victims a stocky chrome dome in a bad mood. In 1933 an evil museum curator resurrects the moldy oldie to enlist his aid in conquering the Scorpion King an ancient warrior and gain world domination. Assisting is a Cher-haired vixen (Patricia Valasquez) the reincarnation of Imhoteps long-ago consort who wants her lover boy back. In a timely if somewhat gratuitous injection of girl power she and Rachel Weisz the luscious Egyptologist who has since wed Brendan Frasers robust adventurer don skimpy outfits and engage in an acrobatic weapon-filled fight that seems straight out of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Here however its more Creepy Tarantula Crawly Scarab. Weisz is now a mummy of the maternal kind and her 8-year-old son (Freddie Boath full of smarty-pants mischief) likes to mess with dangerous artifacts when his folks are busy smooching. Fraser and Weisz trade sexy banter like Nick and Nora in The Thin Man but the actor is at his square-jawed best when facing off with the blue screen. He shines during a breathless sequence on a double-decker bus as it careens through London while Imhoteps bony backup quartet chases Fraser and his sidekicks. Theres much mumbo-jumbo about past lives and symbolic tattoos but who cares when you can gaze at a sight as lovely as a dirigible floating in the night sky? Though overlong and (inevitably) overdone The Mummy Returns overcomes the curse of sequelitis while raising the bar for a marvel-jammed summer at the movies.

Before an angry god changes his fate the Scorpion King (The Rock) relishes battle in ""The Mummy Returns."" The Mummy unravels / Bloated sequel sinks under cluttered plot elephantine effects 1 / 2 Back to Gallery THE MUMMY RETURNS Action adventure. Starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. Directed by Stephen Sommers. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Two years ago ""The Mummy"" breathed new life into an old form. ""The Mummy Returns"" does the opposite. It takes a lively premise kills it and wraps it in tight bandages. It will take a future generation to unwrap this tradition and make it live again. This is not to say the new movie is all bad. It has many of the same elements that made the first film charming -- except charm. It takes place in 1933 eight years after ""The Mummy"" ended. Brendan Fraser is back as OConnell the adventurer and this time he is married to Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) an Egyptologist. They have a smart-mouthed little kid named Alex (Freddie Boath) and love to open doors and dig around in places that havent been disturbed in 3000 years. ""The Mummy Returns"" suffers from the bloat common to sequels. Like a guilty parent showering his child with gifts writer-director Stephen Sommers tries to compensate for a palpable lack of inspiration with generosity. Everythings big The special effects (armies of dog-men marching); the soundtrack (like a biblical epic); the pictures length; and even Weiszs hair extensions. One thing is unforgivably big and thats the plot. The picture has two villains as in one too many. There is Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who wants to take over the world. And theres the Scorpion King who also wants to take over the world. The Scorpion King is played by wrestling superstar the Rock convincing in his film debut as a big guy with muscles. Imhotep might be considered the underdog in that he begins the film without a face. He is an animated mummy an empty shell of bandages but he does have a girlfriend Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez) which goes to show just how far power and an attitude will get a guy. Later his human face recomposes and he looks a lot like Carl Reiner on the old Dick Van Dyke show. As for the Scorpion King viewers will have to unravel that one for themselves. Throughout the picture scenes pop up of evil armies marching against the armies of good. The good guys are easy to identify but the exact source of the evil armies is often hard to track. At one point ""The Mummy Returns"" gets so convoluted that four things are happening in four places at the same time a battle two fights and an incantation to raise the dead. All this is unnecessary clutter around the central action. Young Alex is kidnapped by Imhotep and carried east which means the OConnells have to rescue him. Parents in pursuit of their child should have been enough to keep things interesting. Indeed the films best moments come when ""The Mummy Returns"" slows down long enough to show a human face. The scenes of the OConnells floating through the night sky on a dirigible heading for Egypt have a peaceful beauty about them. Likewise Evelyns flashbacks to her previous life as none other than Nefertiti have the right earnest yet campy spirit. And believe it or not the kid is an amusing character -- precocious slightly bratty and deliberately irritating to his captors. But why bother writing characters when confrontations are so easy? Accordingly Imhotep interrupts the dirigible interlude by making the sea rise to the sky. He even makes the seawall take on the shape of his face. Imhotep must be some kind of computer genius. Then there are the dog soldiers that turn to black dust when they are decapitated. Fascinating. Worst of all there is the loathsome spectacle of the Scorpion King snapping his claws like castanets. Its all computer-generated nonsense and when the film isnt nonsensical and violent its just violent. For a movie aimed at young teenagers ""The Mummy Returns"" has a surprising amount of machine-gun fire and dead bodies. Advisory This film contains violence.

Throughout the 1930s and 40s the studio churned out a number of mummy movies -- ""The Mummy"" (1932) ""The Mummys Tomb"" (1942) and ""The Mummys Ghost"" (1944). Mummies have been very very good to the folks at Universal. Other studios have made dozens of mummy movies over the years but Universal has been the traditional home for these tightly wrapped dead guys who always seem to come to life at the most inconvenient times. In 1999 the studio dug up (pun intended) the tried-but-true concept of these living dead creatures and mounted a new production of ""The Mummy"" this time starring Brendan Fraser. The film borrowed heavily from the style and tone of another Universal mega-success Steven Spielbergs three-film ""Indiana Jones"" franchise. It also made a pyramid of money -- 155 million domestically and 415 million worldwide. So despite a lukewarm reception from critics the public has spoken and we now have -- for better or worse -- ""The Mummy Returns."" The result is a very rare bird indeed a sequel thats better than the original. Borrowed plots lines Dont get the wrong idea. This film still leaves a lot to be desired for anyone lacking the raging hormones (and taste level) of a 15-year-old boy. The special effects are still heavy-handed the plotline laughable. In the end the whole thing is as memorable (and disposable) as an empty popcorn bag. However there are great little moments scattered throughout the picture as writer/director Stephen Sommers (he also wrote and directed the 1999 version) gleefully rips off every famous and not-so-famous movie he can lay his hands on. Theres a touch of ""Gremlins"" (1984) here and ""E.T."" (1982) over there. Shadings of Nick and Nora Charles from ""The Thin Man"" series (1936 -1947) appear occasionally. It even pays a little homage to ""Titanic"" (1997). ""Indiana Jones"" lends itself to the film as does practically every cheesy action/adventure matinee serial from the 1930s and 40s.

(Keith Hamshere/Universal) Julie Brown once sang ""I like them big and stupid."" She would love ""The Mummy Returns."" A sequel to 1999s ""The Mummy"" this outing delivers more of the original releases camp-plus-action formula with a few tweaks. While the first one spent a lot of time establishing the (supposedly) cute relationship between adventurer Rick OConnell (Brendan Fraser) and Egyptologist Evie Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) before unleashing the special effects and action scenes ""Returns"" comes roaring onto the screen with a major battle sequence and a screenload of computer-generated effects in the first 10 minutes. It seldom pauses thereafter. Like the armies of Anubis which everyone in the movie wants to control the fights swordplay chases and explosions come at you in waves. Slower scenes are sprinkled in with two main goals. First to show what a loving and resourceful family Rick Evie and their 8-year-old son Alex (Freddie Boath) are and second to set up the next fight scene. Its like a big-screen version of the WWFs wrestling programs only with more expensive production values (""Returns"" cost about 98 million) marginally better acting more fighting and less blood. Speaking of the WWF if youre wondering how pro wrestler the Rock does as the Scorpion King he barely speaks. (Makes you wonder about the spinoff thats now in production focusing on his character. And as one member of the audience said while leaving the theater ""Do you think he met the rest of the cast? It looks like he filmed all his scenes in a blue room"" so computer effects could be added later.) Fraser is likable enough albeit never quite convincing as an action hero. He just doesnt look like the sort who can outrun the sun or a rushing flood. Weisz is saddled with having to play ""adorably brilliant"" although shes actually more convincing in her fight scenes. The plot is standard issue. Villainous types want to raise the mummy Imhotep so that he can kill the Scorpion King and gain control of those aforementioned armies of Anubis with which they can take over the world. The precocious Alex gets kidnapped by the baddies after inadvertently clamping the Scorpion Kings bracelet on his wrist. Rick and Evie set off to rescue him and if they happen to save the world while theyre at it thats a bonus. The dialogue is also rather basic a few quips amid the flying fists and flashing swords plucky impertinence from the imperiled kid romantic comedy along the lines of an average TV show. Other touches youve seen before (including a few characters brought back from the first film) a wimpy profit-driven sidekick who steps up in a crunch a wacky guy with a knack for flying machines masks that look like surplus from the sets of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Gladiator"" and a battle thatll bring back memories of ""Braveheart."" Oh there also are a couple of Three Stooges-style scenes as well including an eye poke plus a mummy who starts out as a fierce warrior but just before encountering a low bridge suddenly seems like Homer Simpson. Were constantly reminded that Frasers Rick is not the subtle type. Neither is the movie. Its part comic book part old-time serial part video game. ""The Mummy Returns"" may not be the brightest entry in this seasons movie lineup but it has the good sense not to say more than it has to. Which if youre big and stupid is a smart move. ""The Mummy Returns"" (PG-13 125 minutes) - Contains mild profanity virtually nonstop comic book violence and some potentially uncomfortable scenes involving snakes and scorpions.

This is a souped-up engine of action noise and more-ness - more change-ups more battle scenes more elaborate mummy awakenings and more visual references that recycle the familiar and recent from Home Alone to Crouching Tiger. Theres also a piece of The Rock who plays a resurrected warrior.

"Mummy Returns The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mummy-returns-the ) Mummy Returns The (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli The 1999 remake of the horror classic The Mummy surprised Universal Pictures with its box office success. The studio had expected it to be profitable but not that profitable. However long before the worldwide gross crept close to 400 million Universal had already put two additional Mummy films into the hopper awarding the series the ""franchise"" label. The Mummy Returns which re-unites nearly the entire cast from the 1999 movie is the first of these two productions. The other a prequel called The Scorpion King will be released either later this year or next year depending on how Universal arranges its release schedule. Stephen Sommers 1999 feature was an enjoyable if overlong romp recounting the struggles of an adventurer and his companions to stop the apocalyptic agenda of an ancient Egyptian priest. While not entirely successful The Mummy nevertheless boasted an infectious blend of high adventure low-scare horror and special effects that transformed it into a crowd-pleaser capable of sating the early summer audience until The Phantom Menace came along a few weeks later. Now Rick OConnell (Brendan Fraser) Evie OConnell (Rachel Weisz) Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah) Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) and (of course) Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo) are all back. Joining them are a couple of notable newcomers Rick and Evies son Alex (Freddie Boath) and the dreaded Scorpion King (WWF mainstay The Rock). The story for The Mummy Returns is a meager and muddled affair peppered with deus ex machina contrivances. A cult of power-mad Egyptologists (is there another kind?) have concocted a plan by which they can obtain world domination. First they must resurrect Im-Ho-Tep the mummy from the first film. Since they are being led by the ancient priests re-incarnated girlfriend Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez) this proves to be surprisingly easy. Then with his powers restored Im-Ho-Tep heads off to do battle with the mythical Scorpion King whose tomb lies in a pyramid at the center of a hidden oasis. In order to find that oasis Im-Ho-Tep needs an artifact which happens to be in the possession of Alex OConnell. And when the boy is kidnapped that brings his parents his uncle Jonathan and their old friend Ardeth Bay into the conflict. This results in a lot of chasing around the globe and a climax that features a special effects-laden battle between a large force of humans and an army of decaying dog-faced creatures. The fundamental problem underlying The Mummy Returns is the reason that the movie exists in the first place. This is not the byproduct of the creative process; its an off-shoot of Universal Pictures greed. The sequel was made not because the filmmakers had a compelling story to tell but because The Mummy made so much money that a second installment became mandatory. This thought process results in countless pointless and derivative sequels - a class in which The Mummy Returns unquestionably belongs. The plot is just a flimsy excuse to bring back old friends and stick them in a series of cliffhangers. Its low-rent Raiders of the Lost Ark with high-quality special effects filling in for character development and intelligible storytelling. Some of the action sequences in The Mummy Returns are fun and the visual effects are more polished and less noticably ""fake"" than in the previous film. Unfortunately all of this cant obscure the fact that there is basically no plot. The clash of armies at the end has no purpose beyond showing off the effects mavens skills at the computer. (In terms of style its reminiscent of the war in The Phantom Menace albeit without the same strong story motivation.) The Mummy Returns has opportunities to do interesting things (at one point theres a chance to force Im-Ho-Tep and Rick into an uneasy alliance but that is neatly bypassed). Like the Indiana Jones movies The Mummy Returns tries to blend low-key humor with a non-stop series of cliffhangers. However while some of the jokes are funny the action sequences are only sporadically satisfying owing primarily to their often preposterous resolutions. And while Rick possesses a certain charm hes no Indiana Jones. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz rekindle the cute chemistry that existed between their characters in The Mummy. Freddie Boath makes an effective addition to the cast primarily because hes not as annoying as most movie kids. John Hannah is back as the fatuous Jonathan. Arnold Vosloos Im-Ho-Tep is subtly diminished perhaps because he now has to share the spotlight with two other villains. Patricia Velazquez has an expanded role here from the one she essayed in the first film. And the part of The Scorpion King doesnt challenge The Rocks thespian abilities - all he has to do is snarl and look tough - things he is familiar with from his day job. The Mummy Returns offers one surprise - an unexpectedly poignant dramatic moment in which we feel a surge of sympathy for one of the characters. Unfortunately its for one of the bad guys which makes the ending a downer. Overall the film probably offers what fans of The Mummy are expecting. The thinner unnecessarily long storyline notwithstanding this is essentially more of the same. Its hollow lightweight entertainment - not unpleasant but far from the summers definitive action/adventure flick.
