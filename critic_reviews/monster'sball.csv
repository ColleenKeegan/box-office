"Monsters Ball | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; monsters-ball ) Monsters Ball (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Monsters Ball is a powerful and poignant motion picture not about racism and redemption as one might initially suppose but about one of the most urgent and universal of human needs - that of finding solace for pain and loneliness. Though it has some of the trappings of an interracial romance Monsters Ball is not that either. The sex in this movie is not a precursor to love; it is a means by which two people can find temporary refuge from their otherwise bleak existences. An orgasm is an effective way to wipe away everything else if only for a few moments. Coincidence forms the fulcrum of Monsters Balls storyline. In some movies this coincidence would become a major source of plot complications but the screenplay by Milo Addica and Will Rokos is smart enough to confound our expectations. Thus though we may be expecting a big emotional confrontation it never comes. The principle male character is Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) a corrections officer who is greatly respected at work but whose home life is a disaster. Its hard to say whether he has a worse relationship with his surly racist father (Peter Boyle) or his soft-hearted son (Heath Ledger). Hank is charged with supervising the execution of death-row inmate Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs) a cop killer who has exhausted 11 years worth of appeals. Lawrence has a son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) who idolizes him and a wife Leticia (Halle Berry) who cant stand him. Following the execution both Hank and Leticia suffer shocking unexpected tragedies and in the wake of one of these they are thrown together. And because they happen to be there they turn to each other. These characters are far more real than the average motion picture constructs. Most movies are so concerned with plot and visual style that they lose sight of the men and women inhabiting the screenplay. Not so here. Monsters Ball is all about these two people and the forces that push them into a relationship that under any other circumstances would not occur. But there are no easy answers here. Leticia and Hank do not profess (or experience) undying love for one another nor do they ride happily off into the sunset. In fact the movie ends on a beautiful note of ambiguity and perhaps of hope. A mixture of pain grief and guilt - one of the most bitter cocktails the human experience offers - can cause people to do unexpected things in the quest for surcease. When trapped in the midst of raging rapids the drowning victim will grasp at any lifeline no matter how tenuous it is. The characters in Monsters Ball are looking for release. ""Make me feel good"" cries Leticia. Its a momentary thing. Hank and Leticia never truly feel good but they do feel better. In each other they discover something that in its own way is more potent than mere love comfort. When they are together they dont hurt as much or as often. This is a brave movie requiring courageous performances. With this role Halle Berry sheds years of lightweight baggage. Her performance is an odds-on favorite to garner a deserved Oscar nomination. Billy Bob Thornton matches her intensity pace-for-pace. These two radiate neediness and anguish. We can see their inner torment mirrored in their eyes and faces. The hand of Job is upon them both. Much has been made of Berrys baring of her body for the camera but whats even more impressive is the way she bares her soul. The chemistry between Berry and Thornton is strong but its not of the romantic variety. Instead its something more primal - something that movies rarely depict for fear of alienating audiences who want shallow screenplays with hollow characters. This isnt anyones fantasy. Hank is in many ways an ugly individual. He is a racist who has inherited his feelings from his father. As the film wears on his tolerance for blacks grows. This is not the result of some sudden enlightenment but because the passion necessary to sustain prejudice has drained out of him. Hank also perhaps experiences a moment of clarity when he looks at himself and sees the man he most despises - his father. That doesnt prompt his change but it certainly contributes to it. Leticia is no angel either. She abuses her son both verbally and physically because he eats too much. She has trouble keeping her job and is on the verge of being evicted from her home. There are two sex scenes between Hank and Leticia. The first which is the more graphic of the two is so raw and intense that it is more likely to disturb than to arouse. These individuals are using one another to assuage guilt and pain; its an outpouring of need and grief. Theres no kissing just sweaty physical contact. By the time the second encounter occurs Hank and Leticia have developed a bond. There are hints of tenderness and affection in their relationship and it shows during a scene that comes as close to playful as anything in Monsters Ball. But the movie still has one more obstacle to throw in our path and many unanswered questions to pose. This is the second feature from director Marc Forster whose debut Everything Put Together was never widely seen outside of the film festival circuit. Thus Monsters Ball has become Forsters calling card and it makes a bold statement. This is as anti-Hollywood a film as I have seen in recent months one which takes conventional plot ideas and uses them not to season a melodrama but to enrich fully three-dimensional characters and create a forceful motion picture. Hank and Leticia do not let go of you even once the end credits have rolled.

"CNN.com - Review Monsters Ball a disappointing film - February 1 2002 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH VIDEO LOCAL CNN NEWSWATCH E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US/HELP CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe CNNenEspanol.com CNNArabic.com set your edition Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW InStyle Business 2.0 Good acting done in by unbelievable script Review Monsters Ball a disappointing film By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- If misery really does love company it should make a concerted effort to see ""Monsters Ball"" a vastly overpraised study of racism thats so bleak even its sex scenes are a drag. Of course you shouldnt avoid a picture simply because its depressing. But the script by Milo Addica and Will Rokos is so wanting in back story that the main characters motivations are almost impossible to fathom. Although director Marc Forster pulls decent performances from both Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry coincidence-filled plotting lame dialogue and ham-fisted symbolism repeatedly undermine his best intentions. Thornton plays Hank Grotowski a rural Georgia prison guard whose life is little more than a nasty grind. Hank and his son Sonny (Heath Ledger) live in lower-middle-class purgatory with Hanks mean-spirited wheelchair-bound father Buck (Peter Boyle who surprisingly is pretty bad). Both Hank and Buck are unashamed racists the kind of people who make themselves feel superior by firing a shotgun in the air when African-American children dare to step on their property. It makes sense that theres no woman in the house. Genuine love seems out of the question for these men. Good scenes followed by strange twists Sonny unfortunately gets a double dose of Hanks hatred because the two work together at the local prison where one of their duties is to prepare death-row inmates for execution. Their main charge as the story opens is Lawrence Musgrove (Sean ""Puffy"" Combs) a black prisoner who has only a few days to live.

Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thorton in Monsters Ball. Photo HANDOUT Hot and heavy / Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry fall in love in moody Monsters Ball 1 / 1 Back to Gallery MONSTERS BALL Melodrama. Starring Billy Bob Thornton Halle Berry Heath Ledger and Peter Boyle. Directed by Marc Forster. Written by Milo Addica and Will Rokos. (R. 108 minutes. At the Bridge.) Violence family hatred and the poisonous legacy of racism come to play in ""Monsters Ball"" a dark and beautifully directed melodrama about the strange intersection of racism and emotional need. In two striking performances Billy Bob Thornton plays Hank a white death row prison guard in a rural Georgia penitentiary and Halle Berry is Leticia the African American woman with whom he falls in love after participating in her husbands execution. Its a potboiler but a potboiler with class -- told in hushed tones with minimal dialogue understated music and long stretches of silence when the camera regards our tortured protagonists and allows their faces to do the explaining. Director Marc Forster (""Everything Put Together"") has a wonderful sense of pacing and casts a haunting sheen over this tale of damaged souls seeking redemption. His directing style is so spare and moody in fact that one could easily mistake its lack of resolution for mystery. Related Stories Dark haunting Monsters Ball / Berry Thornton sizzle in roles What is Berry thinking for example when her new lover the son of a virulent racist and hardly color-blind himself pledges his love to her? Why is Thornton able in one minute to practically spit on a loved ones graveand then seem like the sweetest redneck on earth? ""Monsters Ball"" is in no rush to answer those questions. Relationships are confused impulses contradicted so its our job to fill in the blanks. ""Monsters Ball"" which opened last month in New York and Los Angeles and is therefore eligible for the 2001 Oscars arrives with an avalanche of buzz resulting from Berrys performance as a tough suspicious widow. Shes already won the National Board of Review award as best actress and been nominated for every other pre-Oscar award. Not to take anything away from Berry but Oscar prognostications have become a reckless wildly self- sustaining game. Opinions are so easily influenced so distorted by hype that a film or performance cant help being diminished by a shrill buildup. Berry gives a brave performance as Leticia but I dont think it stands up to the expectations generated by her Oscar campaign. Shes got a handicap in the vagueness and implausibility of Milo Addica and Will Rokos script and another in her extraordinary looks. No actor should be criticized for his or her beauty or lack thereof but Berry is such a glamorous woman with such a sensational body that its tough to buy her as a bitter working-class sludge on the verge of eviction. Stripping off her makeup helps but the movie works against its own purposes by flattering Berrys face with good lighting and dressing her in tight outfits that emphasize her curves. Thorntons character is no more believable than Berrys but he delivers such an urgent earnest performance that we can almost overlook the gross lapses in credibility and the 180-degree emotional pirouette that his character makes. Peter Boyle is also effective as Thorntons ailing unrepentantly racist daddy. The movies best moment already notorious is a vigorous sex scene in which Berry and Thornton surrender to each other -- in part because of mutual attraction but mostly because of emotional ache. Nothing is held back Its clear that sex in this case is a refuge and a balm an act of healing abandon. Sometimes ""Monsters Ball"" hits the mark and achieves the tough unvarnished eloquence that it aspires to. Other times its muddy overly ambiguous and those eerie open-ended longueurs that are meant to say so much with silence are no help at all. Advisory This movie contains raw language nudity sexual situations and an execution.

Diddy Combs Mos Def; Director Marc Forster; Author Milo Addica Will Rokos; Release Date Limited 12/26/2001; Release Date Wide 01/25/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 111; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Lions Gate Films Posted January 16 2002 -- 1200 AM EST In Monsters Ball a white Georgia prison guard breaks with his family tradition of hatred loneliness and suicide when he falls in love with the widow of a black inmate he helped put to death. Billy Bob Thornton plays a quintessential Thorntonian man of few words but many demons as corrections officer Hank Grotowski the dead-eyed racist son of a virulently racist retired prison guard (Peter Boyle) and father of a prison guard son (Heath Ledger) Hank hates because the young man isnt racist enough. Halle Berry plays Leticia wife of condemned man Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs) and mother of Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) a sensitive boy who buries his sadness in obesity. Hank meets Leticia without divining their cosmic connection when the debt- ridden new widow takes the graveyard shift at an all-night diner. And even when he does discover her significance in his bleak world - he sees a photograph of Lawrence in Leticias house after the two have crossed paths thanks to some more down-home tragedy - Hank keeps the information to himself the way people often do in movies but rarely in life. ""Monsters Ball"" is artful and earnest high-minded and atmospheric. Its inlaid with wordless scenes assembled to create a mosaic of meaningfulness about that most sturdily American of conditions the possibility of redemption through love. Folks dont talk much; they drive cars pour coffee sit still and stare. And I responded so poorly that I went back and watched the thing again to check my bearings. What was it about this upstanding well-meaning prestige production that set off my smoke detectors? There is to begin the diagrammatic nature of the melodrama. The screenplay by Will Rokos and Milo Addica is built on big action-reactions and forced coincidences that have none of the hair-raising organic inevitability of say ""A Simple Plan"" and yet not enough of the grand operatic abandon of Lars von Triers ""Dancer in the Dark."" Hank and his son Sonny not only employ the same local call girl to relieve their itches for instance but do so with the same cold utilitarian joylessness - standing and from behind. Apparently thats the Grotowski style but the detail is also included so that when Thornton and Berry enact the ""Monsters Ball"" centerpiece a long hungry sex scene there can be no mistaking the message of the transformative intimacy that occurs with face-to-face physical contact between Hank and Leticia. (Director Marc Forster cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and editor Matt Chesse sliver shots of graphic lovemaking with darting images of what appear to be hands in a birdcage. The heart you see is being set free. I think.) Those carefully pasted collage touches the significance-laden shots and angles are attractive but suspect. Each character is pretty in his or her detail too - the fat son beaten in frustration by his tippling sylphy mother for hoarding candy bars; the way Hank likes to eat chocolate ice cream in the middle of the night favoring plastic spoons. But the prettiness the way the camera lingers on cunningly lit objects and details and the landscape of a Southern prison (shot at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola its fearful presence felt for real in the towering documentary ""The Farm"") remains just that scenes of pleasing misery and message. Racism kills. Love heals. Eat at Joes. And nowhere does the movies infatuation with loveliness seem more incongruous than in Berrys performance. She throws her heart into Leticia but leaves us with little to know besides her characters well-bred fashion sense (a tastefulness contradicted by the interior decoration of her home). That the actress is stunningly beautiful is her blessing (as well as ours) but at least in this role a dramatic curse too. Much as she deserves to be applauded for her willingness to play dingy Berry is an elegant polished gorgeous actress inhabiting the life of a poor downtrodden woman used to shoddiness and indignity. (Michelle Pfeiffer assayed a similar working-class turn in ""Frankie and Johnny."") What can be faulted though is the extreme refinement with which Leticia is presented so that even her squalor is photogenic. One of the movies many messages is that Hank needs to take care of someone and Leticia needs to be taken care of. And its wonderful if no guarantee of future happiness and the abolition of racism when the two needs can come together. ""Monsters Ball"" is a traffic map of calls and responses lessons and homework wishes and fulfillment. All roads lead to acting-award nominations but none lead to truth.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Burning with a quiet intensity ""Monsters Ball"" is bolstered by a poetic intelligent sensibility not seen in an American film since Terrence Malicks ""The Thin Red Line."" Although sturdy and well wrought pic is also a fragile creation that is best experienced with minimum advance knowledge of its unlikely sounding story. Milo Addicas and Will Rokos script and Marc Forsters direction reinforce one another and -- though the theme of the burdens and faults of fathers visited upon sons and a relentless feeling of tragedy will remind some of Paul Schraders ""Affliction"" -- the ultimate notes of hope place pic in its own distinct arena where adults may achieve renewed and well-earned sense of purpose. Strong critical support and bubbling fascination about lead thesps Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry will help break through the twin barriers of an eccentric title and a demanding though never taxing pace to garner crossover auds for a resolutely indie work of art. There was little in the Swiss-born Forsters second feature the chamber work ""Everything Put Together"" to indicate the creative leap repped by ""Monsters Ball."" Forster appears much more at home with the widescreen frame and its compositional and dramatic choices than he did with the previous films mannered video jazz. He certainly indicates that hes now a director of the first order; tone here suggests a strong kinship with the somber scaling tales of disappoinment by Richard Ford. Matter-of-factly presenting three generations of the Grotowski family in the opening minutes tale begins with Hank (Thornton) a death row guard at Georgia State Penitentiary distinctly defined by his habits which include eating ice cream with a plastic spoon and throwing up the day before he helps with executions. His son simply known as Sonny (Heath Ledger) who also works as a death row guard spends his nights visiting a local hooker. Hanks dad Buck (Peter Boyle) a retired prison guard is hooked up to an oxygen tank and religiously clips news items about prisoners. His racist spewings may have influenced Hank who in purest redneck style orders sons of his black neighbor Ryrus (Mos Def) -- and pals of Sonny -- off his property. Hank explains to Sonny that condemned man Lawrence Musgroves (Sean Combs) execution will be what the guards call a ""monsters ball"" -- without a lawyer or preacher. Musgroves wife Leticia (Berry) with her overweight candy-addicted son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) visit him for the last time after an 11-year vigil but wont attend his electrocution which movies sophisticated skills of observation show as both more brutal than the injection scene in ""Dead Man Walking"" and less hysterical than the zapping sequence in ""The Green Mile."" On Lawrences last walk however Sonny vomits in full view of everyone setting Hank into a violent shamed rage. From the 30-minute mark of Lawrences demise""Monsters Ball"" becomes for the next 25 minutes a kind of dance of death that appears to have no end So totally devastating and -- in its staging -- shocking is the sense of lost lives that the movie feels like a vortex of hopelessness. These characters penned in by a Deep Southern culture still defined by animus and inadequacies that go even beyond racism have nothing left but to pummel each other. Thus Leticias beating of Tyrell for eating candy behind her back goes beyond a mothers rage toward some unexpressed self-hatred. Never has the sight of a boy eating a chocolate bar looked sadder. Nonethelessa subtle change of seasons descends over the movie as Hank quits his guard job and extends a hand of help to Leticia which includes letting her seduce him in a scene of raw intimacy that Forsters camera catches on the sly. Hank sees Leticia as a means to a new direction; Leticia for her part holds much of the drama of the second hour. Its a measure of Thorntons extraordinarily subtle performance that the changes in Hank arrive in barely perceptible movements. Theres the sense one that only comes in the most exciting screen acting work of a thesp uncovering his characters layers in the moment it happens on camera. After the light comedy of ""Bandits"" and the mannered minimalism of ""The Man Who Wasnt There"" Thornton finds just the right balance with Hank a man of few words but ever-expanding feeling whom the actor appears to have in his bones. Berrys work feels no more pre-planned than Thorntons but her Leticia is a woman of ebbs and flows that are so different from Hanks that we wonder if theyll ever work as a couple. Berry with Forsters keen encouragement allows Leticia to silently absorb Hanks giving nature and it seems to transform her as well but never in a way that announces itself as a moment of revelation. This proves crucial in pics final minutes. The closest pic comes to being blunt is with Buck but Boyle talking through his wheezing adds a feeble surface to Bucks ugly innards that makes even this scumbag sympathetic. Ledgers perf is a short cold cruel portrait of a young man with no center while rap star Combs impresses by avoiding the slightest hint of melodrama. Even more impressive is young newcomer Calhoun whose inner struggles recall the poor young black kids of last years ""George Washington."" Working with regular lenser Roberto Schaefer Forster explores every expressive possibility in the widescreen frame The characters especially Hank appear at points to be cornered at the edges while objects -- framed pictures clothing the wire hooked up to the electric chair -- take on giant proportions in close-ups. Tech and design elements never call attention to themselves while the look might be termed Southern Humidity. In a year of dreadful overscoring Asche and Spencers synth and guitar underscore is in perfect moody tandem with the images.

USATODAY.com - Monsters Ball grips from the get-go Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 12/26/2001 - Updated 0813 AM ET Monsters Ball grips from the get-goBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Monsters Ball ( out of four) proves that Halle Berry had a spectacular performance inside her waiting to be unleashed and that Billy Bob Thornton still had a third one left in his stunning 2001 stockpile. Just since October in Bandits and The Man Who Wasnt There Thornton has given us turns that triumphed over the material. This time he has a movie to match him. Methodical in its pacing but gripping from its earliest scenes Ball deals with the reformation of a first-class beast after a dreadful incident that forces him to reconsider the direction of his dead-end life. It is Thornton who plays this racist corrections officer in a small-town Georgia prison and his son (Heath Ledger) has followed in his professional footsteps. Otherwise the two have nothing in common beyond the fact that they patronize the same blonde prostitute a situation the movie treats with deadpan humor which may be the only way to play it. Berrys character is a waitress with an obese son who hides candy bars like alcoholics hide booze and a husband on death row (Sean Combs). His execution isnt the incident that changes Thornton but shortly after it happens he resigns and thinks about buying a gas station. When Berry experiences another catastrophe after her husbands death the two are thrown together in a relationship that no one advertises to Thorntons blacks-loathing father (Peter Boyle). Perhaps Thorntons beast status should be amended from first to second class. The top rank goes to Boyle.The movie is bound to be discussed for the years hottest sex scene which makes Berrys topless bit in Swordfish seem like a minor warm-up for a superstar rock concert. But the truth is Berry makes it here on the strength of her acting which includes a very convincing drunk scene in which she ponders her fate. (Pending eviction is just the start of her troubles.) This is a movie out of nowhere from a director out of nowhere. (Marc Forsters previous two credits are more obscure than the town in which this story is set.) But he seems like a major talent simply on the basis of this movie which takes its first worrisome step at the end with what could have become a melodramatic bungle. Then Forster and his writers (Milo Addica and Will Rokos) reveal they have something else on their minds and a satisfying movie becomes one of years most emotionally stirring.
