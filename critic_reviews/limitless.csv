"Cooper dazzles in `Limitless - Taiwan News Online Hot Topics >> endangered species  GMO  U.S. pork  blast  explosion  KMT  legislature  Tsai Ing-wen  DPP  NPP  ETFs  train  typhoon  terror  more topics >> Sign in / Register Voice of the People Bridge to the World. >> GENERAL Cooper dazzles in `Limitless By CHRISTY LEMIRE Associated Press 2011-03-19 0256 PM Fonts Size Printer-Friendly Bradley Cooper shows he can truly act truly command a screen _ and not just swagger and preen and flash that sexy smile _ in ""Limitless"" and his performance goes a long way toward making this sci-fi thriller more entertaining and more plausible than it probably should be.Cooper stars as Eddie Morra a struggling and depressed New York writer living in a cluttered rundown apartment. Hes already divorced and his latest girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) has just dumped him. These early scenes in which he stumbles around the city in a shlubby stubbly haze reveal a depth we hadnt seen from Cooper in his previous films like ""The Hangover"" ""The A-Team"" and ""Hes Just Not That Into You."" And that makes them just about as exciting in their own way as the ones featuring the amped-up version of Eddie well see later on.One day he runs into his former brother-in-law Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) on the street. Turns out Vernon is a pharmaceutical rep with a new wonder drug called NZT which allows you to tap into your full brain potential. Eddie thinks why not? Hes got nothing to lose.Suddenly hes not only pounding out chapters on his long-languishing novel hes cleaning up picking up new interests learning new languages and wowing everyone he meets. He loses weight gets a haircut buys some stylish new clothes and looks like ... well he looks like Bradley Cooper. More importantly and more realistically though he does the thing wed all do with frighteningly expanded brain power He turns it into a way to make millions of dollars. Fast.Director Neil Burger whose first feature was the intriguing ""Interview With the Assassin"" from 2002 moves the story forward with an infectious energy. ""Limitless"" recognizes the insanity of Eddies predicament and has a little fun with it _ that hes seemingly unstoppable even as he sinks deeper into addiction and discovers some troubling side effects. Burger didnt need to rely on some of the visual tricks he employs though _ words dropping from the ceiling to indicate a break in Eddies writers block or multiple Eddies accomplishing tasks around the house. The fact that Eddies world is brighter faster and more sensory is enough.Still Cooper is surprisingly good as the down-and-out version of his character in the beginning and as the wildly improved version of himself on NZT. Robert De Niro is quietly fierce (and does some of his best work in a while) as the financial guru whos fascinated by Eddie and has a couple of scenes with Cooper in which he reminds you of just how formidable he can be. Cornish meanwhile probably doesnt get enough to do as Eddies on-again off-again girlfriend whos skeptical of the new him.You could probably scour the film for deeper themes an indictment of the pharmaceutical industry or our need to have it all and have it now. You could pick the script apart for impossibilities. But why bother? Its much more enjoyable to shut your brain off and have a good time.""Limitless"" a Relativity Media release is rated PG-13 for thematic material involving a drug violence including disturbing images sexuality and language.

Then Limitless could be for you. Its a colourful brutally nihilistic takedown of all the things most of us hold sacred (love art religion politics) and some of the things we dont (pharmaceuticals economics and those who work in pharmaceuticals and economics). Bradley Cooper excels as Eddie Morra an obsessive character with a million-dollar smile who we meet as an under-motivated New York author and leave as a politician running for high office. In the interim we chart his addiction to a clear shirt-button-like pill that harnesses the full power of the brain turning him from a greasy schlub into a chiselled all-conquering super-brain. But at what price?If you think this sounds too Twilight Zone then youre in for a surprise as Limitless based on Alan Glynns 2001 novel The Dark Fields feels no need for wanton moralising. Instead it bludgeons its victims one by one and leaves a trail of beautiful corpses in its wake. Its scatty and fast paced and director Neil Burger employs some Gaspar Noe-style bad-trip CG effects to heighten the mood. But the main reason the film is so successful and distinctive is that its satire pulls no punches corporate tycoons are corrupt unfeeling bastards but will they really get their comeuppance? And rampant self-medicating of untested drugs can prompt paranoid murderous urges but at the end of the day is that really such a bad thing for society?

The lure of money sex and admirations would prove difficult to turn down. I thought the effects used to demonstarte how Eddie brain felt whilst taking NZT were brilliant.

Loved it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 30 2011TomFeaturedRichard Not sure I agree with you. I think there are large holes in the storylines in this film. The Eddie Morra character wasnt a modest man. He had no problem in showing the world just how brilliant he was. Given he also had political aspirations - hence why at the end of the film he plans to run for senator - its odd that the book he originally struggles with is no longer flaunted/publicised to increase the publics knowledge of him and other books not published to prove just why he should be senator and not another person. On the whole itaEUR(tm)s a pretty flawed story - it doesnt live up to the trailer. That whole loan shark storyline was probably the worst Firstly where would a desperate loan shark get 100k from?; secondly why would that loan shark lend the 100k to Morra whom he barely knew when Morra had no job no apartment of his own and was generally completely down on his luck. Likewise when Morra strikes lucky how come with this aEURoesuper intelligenceaEUR he didnaEUR(tm)t think to pay off the loan shark with the 2m he came into from share dealing knowing thereaEUR(tm)d otherwise be ramifications.

Though the performances arenaEUR(tm)t bad the storyaEUR(tm)s patchy (what happened to aEURoethe bookaEUR?; what happened to his money when the book took off so well?; why no further sign of the book agent who would surely be pressing for further literary masterpieces?; why keep his stash all in one place given the impact should it go missing?; how did the thugs break into a watertight/high security apartment in under 2 minutes with such crude tools?; as others say below why such as abrupt ending?; etc; etc.).

Kept me glued to the screen.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 27 2011TRUTHTELLER.FeaturedThis an excellent and entertaining movie and one of the best Ive seen in awhile. The reviewer Neil Burger has this one correct. It has long been know that all human beings use only around 20% of their brain. Were any individual able to use the other 80% their potential is limitless-particularly when every one else is using just 20%. In the plot our hero is given the oppportunity to try an experimental pill that allows him to use the other 80% of his brain. Naturally such a pill would be desired by many people-inlcuding some really nasty ones and of course all pills have side effects plus power always corrupts. Since many people would want such a pill there is plenty of action and violence in this movie. Bradley Cooper is excellent in the main role and brings a certain humanizing lightness to the film. This is the best film that DeNiro has been in for some time and hes very good . The end of the film leaves you with a question-does he or doesnt he?-but allows each individual imagination to decide for themselves in a way that Hitchcock would have liked. I liked Abbie Cornish as Bradley perhaps more sensible girlfriend and the personable Bradley Cooper gets better with every movie. I saw the film on a pleasant afternoon but it was pretty full and no one left and no one talked-until they left and then they were talking about the movie. One word of caution the director-who does an excellent job-utilizes some pretty fast moving camera techniques when moving say down a street. I could see where this kind of visual imagery might cause some people visual and therefore intellectual distress.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 26 2011MikeFeaturedHmmmm aEUR| the marketing for this filmaEUR(tm)s great but like the effects of the little clear pill when you see the movie after a while youaEUR(tm)re left wanting something more. There are a few flaws in the storyline and in places itaEUR(tm)s very predictable. But on the whole itaEUR(tm)s not a bad movie aEUR"" certainly the story conceptaEUR(tm)s good.

What would you do if you could take a pill and suddenly access 100 percent of your brain power? This is the premise behind ""Limitless"" a sci-fi thriller that looks as if its makers utilized around 30 percent of theirs.Bradley Cooper plays Eddie Morra a would-be novelist whose life changes radically when he is introduced to NZT an experimental black-market pharmaceutical that allows him to remember everything he ever read or experienced learn new languages in a day master complex equations in a blink mastermind Wall Street and presumably decipher the plot of ""Inception.""Since nothing this powerful comes without a price Eddie is soon scrambling to replenish his supply (the effects of one pill wear off within a day or so) and fight off the mobsters who are wise to his wisdom. Meantime his shiny girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) who had written Eddie off as a deadbeat reconnects with her newfound brainiac. He also attracts the attention of Wall Street mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) who resembles a cross between Warren Buffet and a smiling cobra. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Is the fact that Eddie applies his brain power almost exclusively to the financial sector as opposed to say curing cancer or ending world hunger intended as some kind of social commentary by director Neil Burger and writer Leslie Dixon? Or as I suspect is it just that their conception of intelligence isnt very intelligent?

Eddie is a formerly struggling writer who became a Wall Street ace by boosting his brainpower with an unapproved ""smart drug"" called NZT. So this speedy thriller would appear to be a cautionary tale about the perils of intellectual cheating. Guess again Limitless really has nothing against cheating. In fact ultimately the filmmakers doesnt sweat the fact that Eddie is a chemically enhanced fraud. What scares them is any possibility of alienating the movies target audience with a downer ending so they discount all the effort theyve made to push Eddie to the edge and instead send him someplace much cushier. Directed by Neil Burger whose The Illusionist also pulled an upbeat coda out of a hat Limitless is entertaining for much of its running time. Its glib and its overly fond of hyperdrive pans psychedelic montages and swift rack-focus shifts. But these music-video effects suit the drug-fueled saga which at first seems to be about the risks of moving too fast. The film was adapted from Alan Glynns 2003 novel The Dark Fields and is basically Faust for the ADHD era. (One of the most popular real-world smart drugs is Adderall officially prescribed for ADHD but often used to amp up performance among certain overachieving sets.) Like the tragic hero of that legend Eddie doesnt take pills for kicks but for power -- the power of knowledge. At the start of the long flashback that forms the bulk of the movie Eddie is so clueless that he sports a scruffy ponytail. He realizes hes lost his way when indulgent girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) finally dumps him. Then Eddie encounters his former brother-in-law (Johnny Whitworth) an oily longtime dealer who now peddles NZT. He gives Eddie a sample bag; a few tabs later the blocked writer has finished his long-stalled novel. Naturally its a winner. i Hoping to cash in on his pill-induced brilliance Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) hires Eddie as a financial consultant. Unfortunately the Russian mob also wants a piece of the action. John Baer/Relativity Media hide caption toggle caption John Baer/Relativity Media Hoping to cash in on his pill-induced brilliance Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) hires Eddie as a financial consultant. Unfortunately the Russian mob also wants a piece of the action. John Baer/Relativity Media Having conquered literature Eddie progresses to finance. He borrows money from a Russian gangster -- not a genius move -- and makes a small fortune. Soon hes won Lindy back speaks a half-dozen languages and is providing merger advice to a big-time financier (Robert De Niro coasting though an upscale version of his usual gangster thing). Then come the complications. NZT has serious side effects and yet some mean people -- including that Russian -- want Eddies stash. Suicide briefly seems a reasonable option. But a guy with a ""four-digit IQ"" should be able to think his way out even if the escape involves a Grand Guignol moment. With Cooper in the lead role Limitless was never likely to be a profound study of a modern-day Fausts overreaching and downfall. Swaggering is pretty much the actors only mode so Eddies (temporary) undoing doesnt have much weight. The movie also suffers from a slightly musty aroma. Smart drugs (aka nootropics) may still be popular on college campuses but they peaked as a journalistic subject toward the end of the last decade. They lost their kick in fact around the same time everyone realized that Wall Streets soaring profits were based on something other than soaring intelligence. If Limitless is already halfway to being an antique its still moderately amusing as a ""head"" movie for an age that values cash over enlightenment. The new lyrics dont quite scan but you can almost hear Grace Slick singing ""One pill makes you smarter and one pill makes you rich ...""

The premise here is intoxicatingly contagiously thrilling.

Everything I had ever learned or read or heard was organized and available."" No more memory lapses no more senior moments. Instead a lifetime of intellectual experience can be instantly Googled and your conscience is clear because this certainly isnt cheating. Youve damn well put in the mental labour and have earned the right to retrieve its benefits. Thats why the pill ""works better if youre already smart"" and why the conceit is so enticing to the audience. Hey were all smart arent we?Writer Leslie Dixon certainly is. Her script (adapted from an Alan Glynn novel) doesnt just peak with the premise but ascends through the whole picture. It lets Eddie (Bradley Cooper) stumble upon a stash of the pills and then charts a sequence of entertaining witty and yet still plausible consequences. Immediately he does what every writer longs to do with his creative genius win at love and make pots of money. Armed with his firing-on-all-cylinders brain he not only gets his girlfriend back (Abbie Cornish) but after borrowing 100000 from a Russian mobster coolly converts it to a whopping 4-million in the stock market.At this point the plot heats up on two fronts simultaneously. First the mobster (a hilarious turn by Andrew Howard) gets turned on to the narcotic too and finds his vocabulary improving almost as much as his ferocity. Second Eddies financial success attracts the attention of a Wall Street tycoon (Robert De Niro) who hires him to facilitate a vast corporate merger. From there its just a matter of introducing the complications. Alas the drug has certain side effects although nothing that cant be controlled with continued responsible use. Oops now comes the real problem Eddies stash is running out his supplier is kaput and this stuff aint exactly available over the counter.With one exception - a murder-mystery tangent that peters out - director Neil Burger does a tidy job keeping the yarns multiple elements up in the air and neatly juggled. Also his technique for dramatizing the pills effect is refreshingly underdone - no psychedelic gimmickry just a brightened world and more intense acoustics. He even manages to ring a playful variation off the standard gunfight scene complete with a sore-eyed thug literally shooting blind.As for Cooper hes asked to carry almost the entire film and shoulders the load beautifully. Really his intoxicated work here is like The Hangover without the hangover - the same easy comic timing and an identical knack for making ethically dubious choices look amusingly attractive. But theres a bonus too. It comes during a short monologue when De Niro apparently as inspired by the conceit as the rest of us does something not seen from him in a long while - he digs deep into his buried talent and for a few shining moments acts superbly again.Add it all up including the nifty twist at the end and what we have here is a fun Hollywood flick with a good head on its shoulders. The giddy conclusion is obvious Limitless must have swallowed its own pill.

"Review Limitless is sharp but has its limits - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Viadeo Review Limitless is sharp but has its limits By Tom Charity Special to CNN Bradley Cooper and Abbie Cornish star as a troubled couple in the new film ""Limitless."" STORY HIGHLIGHTS""Limitless"" stars Bradley Cooper as a man who gains intelligence through a mysterious drugReviewer says the film is ""inventive"" but ""shoots itself in the foot more than once""The cast includes Abbie Cornish and a brief appearance by Robert De Niro RELATED TOPICS Movies Movie Reviews Bradley Cooper Entertainment Robert De Niro (CNN) -- Which super-power would you have? Weve all played that game. Flight. Super-strength. X-ray vision. Invisibility. In the inventive energetic thriller ""Limitless"" Bradley Coopers Eddie Morra tries something a little different intelligence. Brilliant Why didnt I think of that? Because Im not so smart I guess. Nor is Eddie at first. Hes stumbling through working on the first page of a novel -- the first word even -- drinking too much and relying on bailouts from his soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend to keep the landlord from changing the locks. He looks about as bad as Bradley Cooper is ever going to look. Then he bumps into his ex-wifes brother Vernon (Jonny Whitworth) on the street. Vernons not a dealer hes a ""pharmaceutical consultant."" Against his better judgment Eddie pops the 800 pill Vernon says will help him with his book. Which it definitely does. But in short order Vernon winds up dead and Eddies holding the stash. How to show enhanced IQ on screen? Director Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"" ""The Lucky Ones"") and director of photography Jo Willems seize on clarity. When the pills kick in its as if Eddies 20/20 vision has been restored. The world perceptibly brightens colors are sharper and everything snaps into focus. In one particularly nifty visual coup Willems (or more likely the digital compositor) zooms forward through a series of car windscreens offering a propulsive flowing vision of Manhattans circuitry a kind of street view of the minds eye. Suddenly all Eddies memory banks are firing. He can recall everything hes ever read. Hes uncommonly lucid and articulate. The book writes itself almost but he knows hes too smart to dedicate himself to another one. If hes going to win his girlfriend back hes going to have to make some serious money. Fashioned as a fast-moving thriller with person or persons unknown on the trail of the missing pills even as Eddie makes a name for himself as the hottest whiz kid on Wall Street ""Limitless"" works as a kind of tongue-in-cheek celebration of the cerebral cortex. Mind you its not discernibly deep or introspective. The kind of smarts Eddie finds are of the quiz show quick-fire round variety but at least the movie does show a certain gut-level respect for the intellect thats pretty rare. In most flicks the smartest guy in the room is either a criminal mastermind or a cold-blooded psychopath. Eddie only uses his gray matter to get rich quick and get back with his on-again-off-again girlfriend played by Abbie Cornish but Burger and screenwriter Leslie Dixon do weave in a deft subtext about power and manipulation with Robert De Niros uber-rich financier at the center of everything. De Niro doesnt have a lot of screen time but delivers one great monologue about paying your dues with such authority that Cooper must have been tempted to pull out his cell phone and record it for future reference. That scene apart Cooper looks every inch the movie star. He inherited the role when Shia Labeouf broke his arm but Cooper comes through so strong that looks like a lucky break for the filmmakers. Even as it cruises along the movie shoots itself in the foot more than once. Why on earth wouldnt Eddie put his mega-mind to analyzing the chemical content of his wonder pills before they run out? Who did kill that... ? How come hes so slow to realize...? Well those would be major plot spoilers. Lets just say if youve seen enough movies youll likely stay a step or two ahead of our synthetic genius. ""Limitless"" may not be as brainy as it would like to think it is but its a relatively sharp and surprisingly playful head-trip a satisfyingly novel twist on mindless entertainment.

"Limitless review A high-concept comedy about a supersmart man |       NJ.com comments Limitless review A high-concept comedy about a supersmart man Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 18 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments John Baer Robert De Niro left plays a mogul doing business with a writer who is taking a drug that makes him hyper-intelligent in ""Limitless."" Street drugs do not make you smarter. They may make you more awake more relaxed even more imaginative. But as for your intellectual state -- well as the ads used to say Why do you think they call it dope? Except one day Eddie Morra discovers a drug that makes his mental capabilities almost literally ""Limitless."" He remembers every word hes ever read. He can slap thoughts together like dominos. Hes multilingual multitalented charming. And so he finally finishes writing that long-stalled novel -- in four days. Makes millions analyzing stock picks -- in 10 days. Even wins back his girlfriend -- you know the one who dumped him for being directionless? Still theres got to be a price to pay. And funny -- thats the one thing Eddie didnt see. ""Limitless"" is loud arrogant and almost irresistible -- a lot like its hero. A ""Flowers for Algernon"" for the me-first age its not about a mentally impaired man getting smart -- its about a smart man getting an illegal edge. Its about grabbing any advantage you can. Its about winning and winning and winning some more. Movie Review Limitless (PG-13) Relativity (105 min.) Directed by Neil Burger. With Bradley Cooper Robert De Niro. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains drug content sexual situations strong language and gory violence. Stephen Whittys Review THREE AND A HALF STARS Yet brutal as the fantasy is like Eddies designer drug its still an awesome rush while it lasts. Once Bradley Cooper starts dosing himself the movies colors get brighter the focus gets sharper and every detail becomes an extreme close-up. Words fall from the sky memories play back in film clips and girlfriend Abbie Cornish looks at him with new interest while business mogul Robert De Niro shows wary respect. As with most movies parceling out real-life praise is a guessing game. Screenwriter Leslie Dixon nurtured this project ever since she read the original novel ""The Dark Fields"" but her credits range from ""Ruthless People"" to ""Freaky Friday."" High marks for high-concept comedy less cred for snarky smart art. Director Neil Burger though directed one of the nicest surprises of the last decade the tricky ""The Illusionist"" starring fellow Yale grad Edward Norton. (He also made the underrated coming-home drama ""The Lucky Ones."") If theres a real edge here -- and a lot of cocky trickery -- you dont need Eddie to guess whos the source. Helping everything out is Cooper. The actor is routinely described in press materials as playing the kind of guy everyone likes -- yes but also the kind of pal you reproach yourself for having. Whether its ""The Hangover"" or ""The A-Team"" Cooper projects an oily just-trust-me smarm and whether or not that persona is real its perfect for Eddie. Moralists should know that while ""Limitless"" provides a gruesomely perfect illustration of addiction its not particularly a cautionary tale -- without risking any spoilers its safe to confide that the supremely selfish Eddie survives even after (possibly) committing some horrible acts. So if you want a movie with a sermon well look somewhere else. But if you want an adrenaline shot to the heart look here.

Limitless reviewed Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro in a designer-drug thriller. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 18 2011 1019 AM Limitless Bradley Cooper as a failing writer who finds an awesomely helpful drug. By John Swansburg Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro in Limitless In a video that quickly made its way across the Web this week a man in an orange coat demonstrated how hed hacked into Times Squares massive video screens using only his iPhone and a humble transmitter that looked as if hed salvaged it from a Commodore 64. The video garnered some 800000 views on YouTube before the New York Times reported that its a fake--you cant really go around broadcasting clips from your iPhone onto the JumboTron of your choosing. (And thank goodness for that.) John Swansburg John Swansburg is Slates deputy editor. The video it turns out is a viral ad for Limitless (Relativity) the new movie starring Bradley Cooper as a man whose life is transformed by NZT a designer drug that allows him to harness his full cognitive potential. I cant say I really understand the connection between the video and Limitless--is the inventor of the iPhone gadget supposed to be hopped up on NZT? Its true that both films proceed from plausible premises and both toy with our sense of whats possible in our quicksilver times but only one avoids descending into a confusing dispiriting mess. Its the one thats two-minutes long.Limitless is frustrating in part because it could have been much better. The set-up is simple but clever Performance-enhancing drugs already help us do our homework have sex into our dotage and hit monster home runs. What if someone developed a drug that allowed us to concentrate for hours on end access all of our memories instantly and perform complex mathematical calculations like a supercomputer--a sort-of Adderall ad absurdum. It doesnt seem so farfetched that such a drug might be around the corner. How would we use it? Would it merely allow us to become our best selves? Or would such heightened powers turn us into fundamentally different people swollen Mark McGwires of the mind? Advertisement The guinea pig in this thought experiment is Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) an unkempt unaccomplished writer with a book deal but no idea how to get past that tricky first sentence. (Director Neil Burger establishes Eddies writers block with the standard tableaux--the writer staring at a blank computer screen the writer enjoying a midday cocktail--and with a more ingenious more disturbing scene of artistic stagnation the writer eating a cold pizza crust while perched on the toilet.) One day Eddie bumps into his ex-brother-in-law Vern (Johnny Whitworth) an unctuous drug dealer from whom one should clearly not accept so much as a tip on a decent bagel place. But such is Eddies state of despair that when Vern offers him a hit of NZT--in the form of a pill that looks less like a pharmaceutical than a spare shirt button--Eddie says what the heck and pops it. To Eddies surprise the NZT works just as Vern has promised. He completes a hefty chunk of his book in a single afternoon. (His editor pronounces it ""a little grandiose"" but wants to see more.) After subsequent doses he finishes the book learns the piano in three days picks up Italian from a Berlitz tape wins a street fight using moves remembered from Bruce Lee flicks and Muhammad Ali bouts and starts making big money as a day trader. He also suddenly enjoys great success with women who are impressed by his stunning intelligence. Or perhaps just his stunning good looks? Cooper who gamely attempts to sell himself as a quasi-intellectual schlub in the movies opening scenes soon reverts to well-tailored type wooing women and driving fast cars in the mode of his A-Team character the irresistible rake Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck. Alas for Eddie theres a catch with NZT--its habit-forming. Once a dose wears off he returns to being his normal self. And as he rises through the world of finance--how quickly he abandons the life of the mind--his normal self isnt good enough. Eddie has secured a position at the right hand of corporate raider Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro doing a mediocre Gordon Gekko)and stands to make a bundle on a deal Van Loon is closing. Except Eddies supply of NZT is dwindling and the only known dealer Vern has inconveniently turned up with a gunshot wound to the head. With his stash of pills nearly depleted Eddie becomes increasingly desperate and the movie becomes increasingly hard to follow. By the third act Eddie is double-dosing to stay a step ahead of Van Loon a dead-behind-the-eyes stalker a Russian loan shark the NYPD a worried girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) and the withdrawal symptoms of NZT which has turned out to have more side effects than good old Vern let on. (Some patients have experienced hallucinations memory loss coma and death. Also dry mouth.) The last 25 minutes are so befuddling that this viewer felt he would have needed to Hoover a small mountain of pure Bolivian NZT to sort out all the twists. Of course Hollywood thrillers are permitted to be a little grandiose and the overly complicated plot is less troubling than the movies dubious takeaway. I suppose what follows is a spoiler--it certainly spoiled the movie for me. NZT ravages some of Eddies acquaintances over the course of the film but Cooper is more at home playing the winner than the loser and theres no going back to Papa Johns on the john for him. In the end Limitless is neither a cautionary tale about the dangers of performance enhancement nor a subversive brief on behalf of it. Its an addled yarn about how awesome drugs can be if only youre badass enough to quit anytime you want. In other words its the perfect movie for our Charlie Sheen moment Do the drugs get the girls keep the money. Bitchin. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers reviews Limitless in his weekly video series ""At the Movies With Peter Travers"" Thats the thing about a popcorn thriller that really pops. You access way less than 20 percent of your brain and go with the hot hedonistic flow. Cooper comes out swinging spreading charm and sex appeal over the monster Eddie is becoming. And director Neil Burger (The Illusionist) matches his intensity. Working from the spiky script Leslie Dixon carved out of Alan Glynns 2001 novel The Dark Fields Burger rides this escapist fantasy hard and in high style. Robert De Niro in an expensive haircut that doesnt quite hide a thugs smile adds menace as Carl Van Loon (love the name) a corporate mogul who wants to know where Eddie is getting his mojo. And Abbie Cornish blends passion found and lost into one lovely package. Still this is Coopers show and the Hangover star treats Eddie like a role to feast on which he does with gusto. He catches all the drab self-loathing of a New York writer infamous for his failure to launch. The NZT provided by a friend who is promptly murdered is his ticket out as long as his supply lasts. Enter the narcs followed by higher forces eager to exploit the next big thing. The script sets up a witty premise that a few real-world cultural wunderkinds may have their own NZT. I never said you Mark Zuckerberg. The Complete Archive Over 20 Years of Peter Travers Movie Reviews Now Online OK Limitless does have its limits. The plot hits some nasty speed bumps and the ending is rote. But getting there is terrific mind-bending fun. Watching Eddie flex his brain cells delivers a kick on par with Spider-Man testing his skills with small skips and jumps until he is leaping across rooftops. Take note The pill isnt magic it can only bring out the smarts you already possess. The real housewives of Nip/Tuck USA will still have a struggle. That makes Limitless a potent provocation for the Age of Adderall. Its a wet dream for anyone whos ever dreamed of getting an edge on the information highway. The worst side effect is that you wont believe a word of the damn thing in the morning. Fair exchange. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Carpio Director Neil Burger Running time 145 Release Opened Mar 18 2011  Editorial Review The thrills dont quite addle upBy Michael OSullivanFriday March 18 2011In ""Limitless"" a man gets hooked on a new designer drug that allows him by popping a little clear tablet once a day to access 100 percent of his brain instead of the tiny fraction thats popularly believed that we use. Almost overnight Eddie (Bradley Cooper) goes from being a scruffy mumbling novelist with writers block and a girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) who has just dumped him to a multilingual motormouth with a successful stock portfolio a photographic memory the analytic powers of Watson the supercomputer the martial-arts moves of Jason Bourne and the pick of every beautiful woman in New York. Who wouldnt love a high like that? Soon Eddie is on the run from several disreputable types who have also gotten a jones for mothers little helper called NZT the demand for which vastly outstrips the supply. Through a serendipitous -- and bloody -- series of events Eddie has come into quite a stash. Understandably he doesnt want to share it. But he also doesnt want to die. In director Neil Burgers adrenalized sharply edited and surprisingly engaging thriller (adapted by Leslie Dixon from Alan Glynns novel ""The Dark Fields"") Eddies choice seems to be between getting knifed by another addled NZT addict or killed by the drug itself. The hangover is seems is a drag. Coming down from the superhuman rush NZT produces -- nicely rendered by Burger with an assortment of trippy music-video-style camera and computer tricks -- gives new meaning to the term buzz kill. Withdrawal can make you very very sick -- or worse -- as Eddie finds out when his supply starts running out and he goes in search of other users all of whom seem to be dazed in the hospital or dead.""Limitless"" is a heck of a ride. On the way to its unpredictable (if less than wholly satisfying) conclusion it is entertaining a little silly and visually dazzling. Its not mind-bending like ""Inception"" where you feel as if you cant take your eyes off the screen without missing something. You can. But why would you want to? ""Limitless"" looks great and not just because of Cooper and his amazing baby blues or Cornish hot ex-girlfriend Lindy who eventually turns up again in the chemically enhanced life of her formerly loser lover. The way Burger shoots them when theyre on NZT -- and yes Lindy takes a taste at one point -- they look like not just movie stars but demigods all golden glowing skin white teeth and darting eyes.Watching the movie feels a bit like being on something yourself.Of course for some there may be a little of a post-movie hangover too. As fun and original as ""Limitless"" may be the slightly open-ended climax which involves a sharky business tycoon (Robert De Niro) whos after Eddie not for his drugs but for his brain on drugs doesnt quite add up. At least not in the cool clear light of the multiplex lobby. As a recent screening let out one group of moviegoers could be overheard arguing about what just happened.I felt the same way. For an hour and a half or so ""Limitless"" made me high. But it also left me with a tiny bit of a headache.Contains violence drug abuse sexuality and some crude language.

Limitless"" is about an ordinary man swept up in the giddy force of a brain-altering drug. The man is director Neil Burger and the drug is ""Fight Club."" Bradley Cooper plays a sad schmo who is trying to write a book (note to filmmakers the last time a guy sitting at a keyboard was interesting was in ""The Shining"") but cant get anywhere with it. He is already divorced from his first wife and now his fiancee (Abbie Cornish) is returning his engagement ring. By chance Eddie (Cooper) runs into his ex-wifes brother a former illicit drug dealer now selling something that is or will soon be licit a brain pill. Its like Ritalin on crack. On a normal day we only use 20 percent of our brainpower apparently though if so its unclear why dopey Hollywood thrillermakers seem to assume were only using 5 percent at the multiplex. PHOTOS MOVIES OF THE MIND One dose of the drug later and Eddie is -- saving the world? No writing his little book. And cleaning up his apartment. He finds he can remember everything hes ever read or seen but he needs more pills. Yet his ex-brother-in-law has been murdered. (For the same reason maybe as in the old joke about why the mob killed Einstein He knew too much.) Hollywood movies about intelligence leave themselves wide open dont they? As Eddie acquires a fresh stash of pills and begins a new life as the smartest man on Earth it is left for 20-percenters like you and me to wonder why he doesnt say use his initial profits as a day trader to pay off a loan shark. (Answer Because if he did there would be no movie.) Eddie gets hundreds of pills and discovers that with a brokerage account he can double his net worth every day. Even with my room-temperature IQ I could have told him that his initial stake of 800 or so would make him a multibillionaire in less than a month. (No need to do something as dumb as go to a loan shark in the first place.) At which point even if he ran out of pills he wouldnt need them anymore because the interest thrown off by that much wealth would amount to what former Treasury Secretary Don Regan famously called ""F - - k-you money."" (""The most powerful force in the universe is compound interest"" -- attributed to that fellow Einstein again.) The satirical philosophical and social possibilities of the situation are thrown away as Eddie goes to work for a Wall Street tycoon (Robert De Niro) on a corporate merger that slows down the fun with boardroom meetings and supposed-to-sound-smart jargon. Were fully 45 minutes in before Eddie kicks ass on the subway (""I dont know how to fight. Or do I?"" Cue clips from every Bruce Lee movie and Ali fight hes ever seen) during one of many Tyler Durden-style blackouts that enable his id to come out to play. Theres a dead floozy in there somewhere though director Burger doesnt bother to resolve that story nor develop a subplot that maybe others on Wall Street have been on the drug NZT also. If supplies ran out in 2008 that sure would explain a lot. The movie seems on the standard ""Charly"" or ""Awakenings"" track (in which an inveterate schlump breaks through before the gods break him) but tragedy wouldnt suit Burger (""The Illusionist"") who is mainly interested in fizzy effects sequences in which his camera appears to streak excitingly through New York City. You can tell that Burger is trying to re-create the exhilaration of ""Fight Club"" but alas these sequences reminded me of an above-average Chrysler commercial. There are some shallow thrills as Eddie battles with a couple of goons (one of whom is also on NZT) but the larger issues are simply dropped into a couple of conversations not integrated into the plot. ""Limitless"" may please a few looking for a shallow fantasy thriller but wont fire up the synapses of the intellectually demanding.

Not when the high wears off Elizabeth Weitzman Friday March 18 2011 400 AM facebook Tweet email Limitless starring Bradley Cooper revolves around a writer who takes a drug called NZT which puts him on top of the world. (Rogue Pictures/Evere) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday March 18 2011 400 AM Title Limitless With Bradley Cooper Robert De Niro. Thriller about an all-powerful drug.  Director Neil Burger (145). PG-13 Violence drugs sexuality language. At area theaters.""Obviously I miscalculated a few things"" concedes our fallen hero at the start of ""Limitless"" and director Neil Burger could make a similar admission by the movies end. But if youre willing to ignore the many leaps in logic his fast-paced thriller goes down easy enough with a side of popcorn.Burger (""The Illusionist"") and screenwriter Leslie Dixon have considerably lightened their bleak source novel Alan Glynns ""The Dark Fields."" So it falls to Bradley Cooper to bring some heft back into the project a task he manages with evident enthusiasm.When we first meet Coopers Eddie hes a mess a struggling writer living in a Chinatown hovel wondering why his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) has left him. When a sleazy dealer (Johnny Whitworth) offers him an untested drug called NZT Eddie figures hes got nothing to lose. Turns out he has everything to gain.NZT allows users to access every part of their brain making Eddie a genius -- as long as he keeps taking it. After stealing a supply Eddie believes hes got it made and for a while he does. He finishes his book works for a Wall Street superstar (Robert De Niro) and lures Lindy back.But whats up with those sudden blackouts? And is he really being followed or is he just getting paranoid?Burger mostly ignores the deeper issues Glynn obsessed about like thoughtless arrogance and unearned success. Instead he prioritizes style over substance using ultracool visual tricks and classic New York settings to distract us from the scripts flaws.Some of the plot holes are hard to ignore; given that Eddie is the worlds smartest man he makes some stunningly stupid mistakes. And the ending -- a complete departure from the book -- is unabashedly shallow.But all of that makes Cooper the ideal man for this job. ""Limitless"" is a superficial highly buffed sell and nobody does slick better than the ""Hangover"" star. Effortlessly charismatic he seems to suggest wed be lucky to go along on his ride. And for the most part hes right.The movie looks great never lags and keeps us intrigued throughout. Its not until the high wears off that we realize weve just been had.

John Baer Robert De Niro (left) and Bradley Cooper in ""Limitless"" (AP Photo/Relativity Media John Baer) If there were a pill that made people smarter Id donate an extra supply to the creators of ""Limitless."" This could have been a probing look at human potential and priorities but director Neal Burger (""The Lucky Ones"") and writer Leslie Dixon (""Hairspray"") cant see beneath the surface fantasy of wealth and power.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is an unpublished and seemingly unwashed writer living in a Manhattan hovel. Shortly after hes dumped by his editor girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) Eddie bumps into his former brother-in-law a drug dealer named Vernon (Johnny Whitworth). Apparently out of pity Vernon slips Eddie a free sample of an unreleased pharmaceutical called NZT thats supposed to supercharge the brain.As soon as Eddie takes the pill the whole world snaps into focus (with some nifty if literal special effects) and hes able to finish his long-stalled novel. And after he wrests a regular supply of the drug he teaches himself to counter-attack subway thugs seduce supermodels in their native languages and quintuple his money in the stock market -- you know the things wed all do if we were the smartest people on earth. Unfortunately the seed money for his investment scheme comes from a Russian leg-breaker (Andrew Howard) who demands repayment -- and some pills of his own -- just as Eddie goes to work for a cunning Wall Street mogul named Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). Its not clear why Eddie agrees to work for Van Loon let alone why we should care when the supply of NZT runs out and Eddie goes into withdrawal. Rather than a sympathetic character who flew too close to the sun Cooper still comes across as the kind of towel snapper he played in ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Hangover.""""Limitless"" is rooted in empty materialism but it never evokes the heady rush of a guilty pleasure or the precipitous payback of a thriller even when multiple assassins come gunning for Eddie. And if the have-it-all ending is supposed to be ironic I must not be smart enough to understand it.

"Limitless One pill makes for a smarter sci-fi thriller - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Limitless One pill makes for a smarter sci-fi thriller By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions The lure of popping a pill that offers instant access to everything ever heard read or seen -- even the obscure or only half-listened to -- is seductive indeed. By John Baer Relativity Media Take as needed for outrageous brainpower Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper explore the minds true potential. EnlargeClose By John Baer Relativity Media Take as needed for outrageous brainpower Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper explore the minds true potential. Forget those antioxidants and omega-3s. Ingest a tiny clear tablet and tap the brains full potential unleashing the ability to learn a language in hours absorb complex equations and write books in a day. Bradley Cooper plays Eddie Mora a blocked novelist whose life changes drastically as he succumbs to this chemically induced intellectual enhancement. TRAILER Check out Limitless Limitless a sci-fi fantasy thriller based on Alan Glynns novel The Dark Fields is surprisingly witty. Some of the best lines are delivered sardonically in the intermittent voice-over narration a device that works better here than in most movies. ""I suddenly knew everything about everything"" Eddie says. Even fear and shyness disappear as his brainpower shifts into overdrive. Initially ""NZT"" renders Eddie unusually neat and clear-headed and takes away his appetite. ""What was this drug that made me abstemious and tidy?"" he muses. Limitless    out of four Stars Bradley Cooper Robert De Niro Abbie Cornish Anna Friel Director Neil Burger Distributor Relativity Media Rating PG-13 for thematic material including a drug violence including disturbing images sexuality and language Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Opens Friday nationwide He finishes his novel overhauls his grungy apartment cuts his unkempt hair dons a well-cut suit and slides into investment banking. When questioned Eddie arrogantly insists ""I dont have delusions of grandeur. I have an actual recipe for grandeur."" With his daily fix he has become rich and powerful overnight influencing the elite including Robert De Niro who plays a financial powerhouse. Eddie even wins back Lindy (Abbie Cornish) the girlfriend who left him during his slacker days. ""Obscure memories and half-watched PBS shows all bubbled up in my consciousness"" Eddie recalls. He remembers book titles he had barely registered seeing -- and more impressively knows what is contained inside their covers. But addiction does not come without a price. Eddie soon has a scary Russian mobster after him and gets embroiled in a murder investigation. He also learns that unlike what he was told the drug was not approved by the FDA and withdrawal is a fearsome prospect. With his inherent charm Cooper is well-cast in the role. He can smoothly pull off the part of a guy with a suddenly surging ""four-digit IQ."" De Niro in a smaller but pivotal role is also excellent. Other supporting parts are less distinguished. The look of this darkly funny thriller is mesmerizing especially the rapid-fire paranoia-inducing camera zooms of Eddies world while on NZT with its saturated colors. Director Neil Burger (The Illusionist) is a talented visual stylist and his film has an evocative production design. A brutal fight involving Eddie his Russian nemesis and some henchmen drags on too long. But its climactic moment would make Bram Stoker proud. Better living through chemistry is a debatable notion satirically explored in this briskly paced suspenseful thriller. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Comments click to enlarge Limitless Recommended Video Rated PG-13  97 minutes  2011 Without much fanfare Neil Burger has emerged as one of the best suspense directors in the business and the irony of this accomplishment is that his thrillers (Interview With the Assassin The Illusionist) resort to very little fanfare themselves in an era of loud frantic aerobic workouts like Salt and the Bourne franchise Burger builds suspense the old-fashioned way through meticulously clean and careful plotting. The protagonist of this little gem is a ratty would-be novelist (Bradley Cooper of The Hangover) who gets his hands on a neuro-enhancing wonder drug and begins to access 100 percent of his brain capacity; after dashing off a best seller he turns his dazzling mental powers to the stock market and comes to the attention of a scheming corporate titan (Robert De Niro). Some might call this movie a step backward after Burgers previous feature the painfully honest Iraq war drama The Lucky Ones but as a stylish intrigue its hard to beat. With Abbie Cornish. By J.R.

Carl (Robert De Niro left) tells Eddie (Bradley Cooper) about the side effects of the wonder drug NZT. Photo Dark Fields Productions Limitless 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Its amazing what a little pill can do. Just ask Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) a slobby aspiring novelist with a massive writing block and the ugliest ponytail you ever ever saw. Before he takes the experimental drug NZT hes pathetic. Aimless. Behind on his rent. Incapable of washing dishes and/or hair. No wonder his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) dumps him the loser. But one dose of NZT which amps up his brainpower to superhuman levels and blammo ""Enhanced Eddie."" Within minutes he talks the landlady into bed with him. Then he tidies his apartment gets a haircut and buys new clothes. Even better NZT allows him to whip off a brilliant first novel in less than a week the words tinkling around him in a heaven-sent rush of pure literary genius. After that he learns to play Rachmaninoff picks up babes in Puerto Vallarta turns fluent in multiple languages and naturally conquers the stock market. All of this occurs near the start of Limitless a snazzy piece of total nonsense that asks what a hypothetical schlub might do if he could access 100 percent of his brain. Which is kind of funny because the rest of us schlubs access 100 percent of our brains on a daily basis just not all of it simultaneously. The old myth suggesting that only 10 percent or 20 percent of gray matter is accessible to its owners is just that a myth. It makes a great premise though. It also makes a great excuse to put Cooper in every scene in various configurations of clothing grooming lighting and perkiness. Told from Eddies perspective the movie features his own bemused narration as he morphs from boobish slacker to glam jet-setter to something approximating a young Mitt Romney. Cooper is eminently watchable throughout and his performance should dispel any lingering doubt that he has the chops to carry a movie alone. He even squares off against Robert De Niro (as a financial bigwig) without getting crushed. The story gets away from itself as it barrels forward. The teensy-weensy bit of sense it makes at the beginning is quickly sacrificed in a conclusion so facile illogical and cheap that it could use a dose of NZT itself. But until then director Neil Burger (2006s The Illusionist) and screenwriter Leslie Dixon (adapting Alan Glynns novel The Dark Fields) spin out their tale with restless energy. The visuals are giddy illustrating Eddies high with fun house lenses over-exposed colors supersonic edits -- and when side effects kick in dizzying flights through the streets of New York. For a long and interesting stretch Limitless looks and acts like a high-concept addiction narrative a Just Say No cautionary tale pocked with strung-out ex-junkies and withdrawal symptoms. But its also a thriller with that comes some monkey business with a vicious Russian mobster (Andrew Howard) and with that an excuse for some rather creative violence later on. It turns out the smart pill enhances every part of the brain including the part that discerns alternate uses for a grand piano.

Mission unaccomplished. By Colin Covert Star Tribune March 24 2011 -- 201pm Video (3754)  A writer begins elevating his IQ to super-genius levels with a black-market smart pill unaware of the side effects. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In ""Limitless"" Bradley Cooper sets out to display his range as a performer impatient with cocky Handsome Guy roles. He spreads his wings with a veritable postgraduate Justin Bieber seminar on Acting With Your Hair. At the beginning of the tale his character Eddie is a failed writer with a frizzy unkempt hairstyle suitable for a derelicts mug shot. When he begins elevating his IQ to super-genius levels with a black-market smart pill he graduates from the tangled despondent look to a sleek coiffure thats at once casually windswept and impeccable from all angles. This tells us that Bradley Cooper is a versatile actor and that the creative team behind ""Limitless"" has never seen a photograph of Albert Einstein. Im guessing there are not many Mensa members among the filmmakers. They have given us a movie in which the brain-booster inspires one user to fight off a slasher by grabbing a cute little skater off an ice rink and using her blades to counterattack. Now there is dazzling intellect on display. No way that plan could go wrong. Director Neil Burger has a lot of fun visually dramatizing the workings of Eddies mind in overdrive. His writers block evaporates amid a monsoon of letters dropping from the heavens. The film is imitating not just the drug-rush look of David Finchers ""Fight Club"" but some of its giddy cynicism. Eddies manic rise to power and privilege in New York makes him a kindred spirit of Ritalin-fueled students steroid-enhanced athletes and functioning-addict celebrities. Eddie is allowed to get away with almost everything -- as long as he produces. Needless to say things go haywire. The drug has unfortunate consequences if you continue to take it and lethal side effects if you quit. Villains high (Robert De Niro as a ruthless financier) and low (Russian drug thug Andrew Howard) conspire to turn Eddies powers to their advantage. Eddies life like any addicts shrinks to finding more of the drug and protecting his stash. Sadly the tricks his overstimulated mind plays on itself arent very interesting. ""Limitless"" misfires on any number of points; its not a particularly smart or imaginative yarn. Still it ends on a wry note that toys with movieland conventions of poetic justice. While cheating over-reachers are usually punished for their hubris this story travels a novel path as Eddie unveils another character twist. Its unmistakable that he has a fresh outlook on life. Hes wearing a new neatly combed hairstyle that tells us so. John Baer Relativity Media Bradley Cooper and Abbie Cornish in ""Limitless.""

"Movie review Limitless - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Bradley CooperMovie review LimitlessIn Limitless star Bradley Cooper takes a pill that makes him super smart which gets him only so far before the plot unravels in this would-be thriller.March 18 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Bradley Cooper left and Abbie Cornish star in ""Limitless."" (John Baer )Very early on in ""Limitless"" a psychological tease about a pharmaceutically enhanced brainiac star Bradley Cooper is teetering on the thin rail of a high-rise balcony contemplating one of those jumps that guarantees the sweet hereafter.It turns out to be as good a metaphor for Cooper as it is for his character Eddie Morra; both are courting considerable risks in director Neil Burgers wannabe thriller about a super-pill that will make anyone who takes it super smart.For Cooper the question was Could he play smart-Eddie? He comes close enough to suggest there is something more to the actor than just smirking arrogant handsome guy which until now has been the definition of most of his characters notably his breakout role in ""The Hangover."" For Eddie its more a management issue a can he handle the high-octane mind-over-matter life hes suddenly got?But smart isnt all its cracked up to be and soon the movie is unraveling faster than all of Eddies grand schemes. The pill may be new but the lessons are old a all drugs have side effects and all the smarts in the world dont keep you from making dumb decisions. The latter perhaps something the filmmakers should have paid more mind to.Burger who crafted 2006s likable period drama ""The Illusionist"" with Ed Norton as a magician has got a lot more illusions to create here in trying to bring novelist Alan Glynns ""The Dark Fields"" to the big screen. Leslie Dixons screenplay has streamlined the book merged some characters and complications and given it a Hollywood ending that dispenses with most of the morality clauses that the novelist used to counterbalance the aphrodisiac of brilliance.Abbie Cornish is his on-and-off girlfriend. Robert De Niro is a corporate merger heavy who wants a piece of smart-Eddie and then wants a piece of the smart-pill action. They are there essentially to play angel versus devil on Eddies shoulder while he contemplates the power and the possibilities of always being the smartest guy in the room.But the fundamental difficulty is that so much of Glynns story lives in Eddies mind. What does smart look like? How does it feel? Glynn uses up a lot of words answering that.Its not as easy to do with a camera lens though director of photography Jo Willems tries to keep it interesting and intense and have a little fun with it too. Sometimes Eddie finds himself walking through a thunderstorm of letters raining down around him or watching as the ceiling tiles spin like a slot machine with numbers everywhere. And sometimes Eddies brain is working so fast that he gets ahead of himself a literally a with both of us (audience and Eddie) able to see multiple Eddies trailing neon streaks of energy like a comet as he pushes the boundaries of this brave new world made possible by the super-drug named NZT if you care and not I repeat not FDA approved.In addition to giving smart a shape and form theres a story to tell and too much is done via a voice-over narration by Cooper. At first Eddie is a disheveled and failing writer; so a writer. A shady old friend he hasnt seen in years slips him a tab of help a little piece of temptation that will unleash the 90% of his brain he hasnt been using (its the scientific average with humanity typically turning on only about 10% of our intellectual wattage or so were told).After Eddie takes an NZT tab he writes a novel in one night. A few more pills and hes speaking a couple of foreign languages day-trading then brokering mega-mergers which is where De Niros mogul a guy named Van Loon comes in. Also the shady friend (I think the technical term is ""dealer"") is dead there is a skin-peeling loan shark with an Eastern European accent after him and Eddies stash of pills is shrinking.The disappointment is that for all of the possibilities ""Limitless"" never gets beyond ""limited."" De Niro is playing Van Loon at the intersection of the ""Meet the Fockers"" ex-CIA conspiracy-fueled father-in-law and his overbearing self-righteous daddy dearest of ""This Boys Life."" Cornish is just playing pretty but in that accessory way that ensures her Lindy has more warmth than depth. Best of the bunch by far is veteran British stage actor Andrew Howard making an excellent skin-peeling villain and an equally excellent case for why bad guys should never be given smart pills.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSchwarzeneggers comeback flops Del Toros Mama is a hitJanuary 21 2013The Possession to scare off Bradley Cooper on slow weekendSeptember 6 2012Relativity Media is at a crossroadsNovember 12 2011Hollywoods little secret movie purgatoryOctober 23 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTBradley CooperBrave New WorldCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-limitless-20110318,0,1406306.story",200,limitless20,limitless,latimes

He plays a deadbeat New York writer who gets turbocharged; she is his girlfriend.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted March 18 2011It is said that most people use just 10 to 20 percent of what their brains are capable of. But what if the other 80 or 90 percent were suddenly made available?Imagine Cancer cured clean energy distributed worldwide transcendent works of art and literature everywhere. Hey maybe we could teleport. And how about an episode of The Jersey Shore with Snooki and The Situation competing in the World Chess Championships - and one of them wins.In the exhilarating Limitless the neurons of a deadbeat New York writer get turbocharged thanks to a clear little pill that Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is handed by a slick shifty figure from his past. NZT its called and it costs 800 a pop and as Neil Burgers wild ride begins something has gone terribly amiss.""Obviously I miscalculated a few things"" Eddie tells us in an old-school noir voice-over as he stands on the ledge of a high-rise about to take the final plunge.Cue the flashback as Limitless - deftly adapted from Alan Glynns novel The Dark Fields by screenwriter Leslie Dixon and directed with fractal-zoom ingenuity by Burger - rockets along as Eddie dives down the rabbit hole and emerges with a four-digit IQ and an ability to finesse the stock markets summon lost memories in photographic detail speak fluent French Italian and Mandarin and deliver his long-dormant manuscript to his publisher. And the manuscript blows her away.Its all too good to be true and sure enough midway through this terrifically inventive thriller the downsides and side effects of NZT become manifest. But Eddie is riding high literally and figuratively and the danger signs are easy to ignore. Not so easy to dismiss is a Russian crime boss (Andrew Howard) whos fronted Eddie a wad of cash. Or Carl Van Loon (gotta love that name) a billionaire impressed with Eddies Wall Street savvy. Robert De Niro plays Carl with an uncharacteristically easygoing air - heres a corporate titan so comfortable in his rarefied world that he doesnt need to raise his voice. Raising an eyebrow will suffice.Of course theres a woman. In Limitless Abbie Cornish is Lindy the girlfriend who cant believe the transformation Eddie has undergone from slacker and slob to industrious keenly observant charming witty GQ fashion plate. Whoa Nelly.Cooper manages to pull this metamorphosis off with humor and aplomb - theres a lot going on with his character and the actor convincingly conveys both the old Eddies total loserness and the ""enhanced"" Eddies swagger and acumen. More than The Hangover (and certainly more than The A-Team) this is the movie that proves Cooper has the stuff of a leading man.Is Limitless a cautionary tale about the pharmaceuticalization of our culture? Maybe. Is it about the overarching quest for wealth and material goods in our society? You bet. Is the whole thing a cocaine metaphor? Quite possibly. And in its closing scene (the only spot where Limitless lets us down a little - and where De Niro doesnt look quite as smooth and natty) are the politics of power and the power of politicians seen as a good thing or something to be feared? Open to discussion.But what can be said without equivocation is that Limitless rocks.And a P.S. of local interest Although Limitless is set in New York - and features a crazy kinetic sequence with the camera whooshing up Manhattans avenues to prove it - most of it was shot in Philadelphia. Natives will note familiar spots the perimeter of Rittenhouse Square a Marathon Grill the old AAA headquarters on Market Street the inside of Del Friscos steak house. Its to the films credit though that even with the displaced geography Limitless doesnt invite a restless random scanning of the screen. The storys too good and dark and fantastic for us to be distracted by mere scenery.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Share Tweet A popular myth claims that humans only use a small percentage of their brains to function which has naturally led to speculation about geniuses using a higher percentage or about the untapped power psychic or otherwise that would come from accessing the Funyuns-consuming inactive remainder of the brain. The slick new thriller Limitless doesnt question the myth but it seductively exploits the fantasy of greater knowledge greater perception and a greater ability to make bank and change the world. As mortal powers go thats nearly as appealing as invisibility or flying and the pharmaceutical challenge of firing a few more synapses in the brain makes for oddly plausible science-fiction ridiculousness in the age of Prozac and Viagra. Director Neil Burger has shown a flair for conceptual gimmickry in films like Interview With The Assassin and The Illusionist and Limitless highs are sustained and visually snappy a David Fincher-esque vision of New York conquered. But the side effects are a little troubling. Cast perfectly to type as the smugly handsome hero Bradley Cooper stars as a 35-year-old deadbeat who cant afford his fleabag New York apartment and labors over a science-fiction novel one deleted word at a time. By chance he happens across his shady ex-brother-in-law who offers him an experimental designer drug that vastly expands brain function. After one euphoric spectacularly productive day Cooper seeks out the rest of the stash but complications arise from various parties who also want the drug and from the drug itself which offers terrible consequences for frequent use and withdrawal alike. Still he makes the most of its benefits using stock-market gains to draw the interest of ultra-rich corporate baron Robert De Niro. Theres a moral to the story of course voiced by Coopers on-again/off-again girlfriend Abbie Cornish Like a lot of drugs legal or illegal this one may enhance his abilities but it also takes him away from himself. Happily Limitless more or less drops the moral and indulges in the heady fantasy of being a pharmaceutically enhanced winner. Cooper acts like his own genie in a bottle achieving instant wealth writing a prize-worthy novel in a few days and getting laid in the process. Working from Alan Glynns novel The Dark Fields Burger and screenwriter Leslie Dixon are so content with keeping him on the fast track that they lose any sense of moral depth or consequence. Its a small victory for flash in its eternal war with substance but in this case the flash is enough.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Occasionally while Im folding laundry or waiting for the airlines to realize how bad their hold music is Ill have this thought Why do I so dislike Bradley Cooper? The body of that hair that forever tan those teeth that gleam even through a smirk. He seems redundant in an industry that already has Matthew McConaughey. Yet the movies Cooper has been in (""Hes Just Not That Into You ""The Hangover ""The A-Team) leave him many watts of stardom away from McConaughey (who isnt exactly the biggest bulb in the Hollywood socket). Cooper is more like Jessica Biel a table with good legs and a better agent.The movies suggest hes an actor for a moment in which men are prized for exuding a kind of lightly sleazy certainly vain cologne -- Robert Downey Jr. in ""Iron Man Ben Affleck in ""The Town Jake Gyllenhaal in ""Love amp; Other Drugs Ashton Kutcher in ""No Strings Attached Seth Rogen in anything. Cooper is 36 and still seems to smell of prep school and frat parties. Hes hedge funds and trust funds; pickup lines and divorce court; Heineken and Nicorette. In ""Wedding Crashers he played a guy named Sack Lodge. Its one of those amazing instances in which a characters name really is a personas address. A moviegoer should bring protection.Of course about 20 minutes into ""Limitless his new movie and first solo vehicle I realized exactly why I hate Bradley Cooper Because I think I love him. You know how it is. Its easier to roll your eyes rather than bat them. You resist because succumbing to a man who makes potential movie stardom seem cheap and easy reeks of hypocrisy. To love him is to contradict yourself. But for now Im willing to risk the conflict.""Limitless casts Cooper as Eddie Morra a distracted Manhattan writer whose fortunes change after he starts taking a pill that turns him into a focused genius. You laugh I laugh but Cooper doesnt and thats the shrewdest thing about the movie He believes in himself. The movie is too chaotic to be very good. But its fun and not stupid which is something. When it begins Eddie is a disheveled mess. His book -- something about ""the plight of the individual in the 21st century -- is past due as are both his rent and his ability to be more of an adult for his up-and-coming-publisher girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish with nothing to do).Eddie runs into his former brother-in-law (Johnny Whitworth) a drug dealer pushing a designer product called NZT. It looks like a shower-curtain chad. Eddie pops one and becomes according to his narration a ""sparkling cocktail of useful information. The movie gets a contact high. Its dingy look turns bright in the way that in certain cleanser ads mildew on a toilet fades to blinding white. Sadly when hes off the drug the mildew returns. On NZT and courtesy of a montage Eddie seduces his landlady cleans and organizes his apartment finishes a draft of his novel. The director Neil Burger uses pinball-like sounds has letters rain down around Cooper as he types and sends the camera pivoting this way and that. Eddie teaches himself languages math the piano medicine. He jet-sets thrill-seeks and day-trades. Its all part of a master plan that also requires access to the financial industry which he enters and becomes such a whiz that he wins the skeptical attention of a business titan played by an appealingly dour Robert De Niro.This being a thriller in addition to everything else it is ""Limitless requires Eddie and inevitably Lindy to flee the baddies who wants Eddies ill-gotten stash of NZT. Theres also a Slavic leg-breaker (Andrew Howard). Its a wonder that with all the movies science-fiction foot chases they fail to bump into Anthony Mackie and John Slattery running after Matt Damon in ""The Adjustment Bureau. Leslie Dixon wrote the script from Alan Glynns 2001 novel ""The Dark Fields which has tinges of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson. But I wouldnt have been surprised to discover that the whole thing was based on a New York magazine article (""NZT the hot smart drug youre not on. Yet).Burger works at an involving clip thats probably meant to keep us from minding the many loose ends and other nonsense (including perilous side effects a mysteriously dead model and a political campaign). With a little risk this could have produced a stronger stranger darker movie. (There are limits after all.) The movie instead is merely a manic entertainment that makes a case for its lead actor to be taken seriously as a star.For as much as he seems like bootleg McConaughey Cooper might be more interesting than that. ""Limitless is basically an addiction thriller in which the thirst is for the acquisition and execution of knowledge. So you need an actor who seems surprised by how smart he is but not afraid to be charmingly intelligent. Cooper turns out to be perfect for the part. McConaughey whose latest movie ""The Lincoln Lawyer also begins saturating movie theaters today might have overapplied his drawling cockiness which needs only the exuberant self-confidence Cooper provides. When he uses a word like ""abstemious he sounds as if he knows what it means. Meanwhile Im abstemious no more. Take me to Sack Lodge.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Limitless | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; limitless ) Limitless (United States 2011) March 17 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli After toiling on television for years Bradley Cooper graduated to the big screen with a number of credits that placed him in supporting and/or ""best friend"" roles. With the runaway success of The Hangover Cooper leapfrogged from ""character actor"" to ""marquee name"" paving the way for movies like Limitless in which he (not co-star Robert DeNiro) is the main draw. In a part that in no way recalls his work in The Hangover Cooper is credible. The problem with the movie isnt the acting its the story which falls considerably short of the promise of its premise. For a plot about super-intelligent people the screenplay is surprisingly dumb. Ironically for Limitless to work it is necessary for the viewer to reduce brain functioning. Even a little rudimentary thought about whats transpiring on screen will torpedo the movies effectiveness because basic logic doesnt apply. The holes arent simply large enough to drive a truck through; theyre so huge they could gobble up a planet. Neil Burger brings a flashy visual style to the movie with some dazzling CGI-enhanced tracking shots that may cause monetary strobe-like disorientation. At times Limitless comes across like a synthesis of Wall Street and a superhero movie on acid. It may not be smart but its never boring. Cooper plays Eddie Morra an unsuccessful writer living in a Manhattan dump and struggling with writers block. His girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) has left him and his attempts to begin his science fiction novel result in him sitting around his apartment doing nothing. One day a chance encounter with his ex-brother-in-law (Johnny Whitworth) Vernon bears unexpected dividends when Vernon offers Eddie a sample drug called NZT. Supposedly ""safe"" and FDA-approved it enhances brain power allowing the person to use 100% of his mind. The one pill dramatically alters Eddies life. Not only does it motivate him but it allows him to start his novel and reason out things that would baffle most ordinary humans. When the effects of the drug wear off he craves more so he goes back to Vernon - and thats when he becomes entangled in a criminal mesh that includes gangsters lawyers and high rollers. The problem with making a film about the actions of a really smart person (at one point Eddie indicates his IQ is four digits) is that the writers typically arent intelligent enough to replicate the actions and abilities of a super-genius in a credible way and the result is inconsistent (often maddeningly so) and silly. Whether this is a problem with the source material (Alan Glynns novel The Dark Fields) or whether its an artifact of the screenplay is irrelevant - the movie is unable to effectively present a protagonist whos as brilliant as we are told he is. In the end Limitless degenerates into a mundane thriller with shootings knifings and fist-fights. The climax is a disappointment and the epilogue feels like a cheat. Its nice to see Robert DeNiro playing it straight. Aside from Stone he has spent too much time in recent years slumming. Here hes a hard-nosed high-stakes business man and this gives him an opportunity to deliver a monologue about earning ones place in the world. Its a snappy piece of writing that one might mistake as having been penned by Quentin Tarantino and DeNiro delivers it as only DeNiro can. The veteran actor doesnt have a lot to do in Limitless but his presence is welcome. In fact aside from Cooper no one is provided with much of a role. Abbie Cornish is a generic love interest (with one flashy moment featuring a little girl on ice skates) and Andrew Howard is a thug with a Russian accent. At one point I thought Limitless was going to turn into a cautionary tale about ingesting untested drugs but that element of the plot is dropped when its no longer convenient. Still despite a heavy load of contrivances and inconsistencies Bradley Coopers likability and the fast kinetic pace will keep most viewers involved and it may not occur to the majority how many potentially rich storylines are left unmined due to either time constraints or laziness. Limitless is eye candy with a little jolt of adrenaline for those who want to give their brains a 105-minute rest.

"Limitless Turn on tune in watch out | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLimitless Turn on tune in watch outGreat performances by Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro break all barriers in Limitless despite a slightly dumb script about a smart pill.Bradley Cooper is a capable everyman in Limitless.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 17 2011 Limitless (out of 4) Starring Bradley Cooper Robert De Niro and Abbie Cornish. Directed by Neil Burger. 105 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. 14A For a guy with a super genius IQ Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) does some pretty dumb things. Things like keeping his brain drug stash out in the open. Or walking around unprotected in New York City when he knows gangsters are after him. And whats he doing standing precariously on a skyscraper ledge? But lets not get ahead of ourselves even though the chemically enhanced Limitless is all about pushing limits. The film makes some dumb moves too but overall its smart entertainment that even manages to make Robert De Niro Coopers co-star sound fully engaged. Limitless is directed by Neil Burger whose previous film The Illusionist made a small budget seem like a blockbuster one. He works similar magic with slightly more money this time using a technique he calls ""fractal zoom"" to boldly illustrate the speeded-up thoughts and actions in Eddies newly wired world. How wired? Imagine if you could remember everything youve seen heard and learned in your life immediately summoning it with boundless energy. All thanks to a mysterious drug called NZT delivered via a pill that looks like a clear button which transforms Eddie from a down-and-out writer into a Wall Street winner a multi-tasking magician and a bedroom stallion. He scores the stash from the sketchy Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) brother of Eddies ex-wife Melissa (Anna Friel) whom we meet in the worlds fastest romantic flashback from ""I do"" to ""This isnt working"" in a heartbeat. The premise of Limitless is pulp science fiction. NZT has serious side effects natch chief among them being blackouts and hallucinations. Oh and if you stop taking it you could die. That is if you dont first expire at the hands of the brutal loan shark (Andrew Howard) whom youve carelessly let in on your secret or the uncompromising tycoon (De Niro) youve made reckless promises to. At times the script by screenwriter Leslie Dixon (Hairspray) based on Alan Glynns novel The Dark Fields trades logic for expediency a strange thing to have in a movie about a mega mind. How many dim-witted thugs for example would just happen to be carrying acetylene torches with them when theyre trying to break into a condo the one with the dangerous ledge? Theres also an over-reliance on those corny speeches by bad guys who want to take their sweet time delivering the coup de grace. Dixon at least keeps the business jargon brisk thankfully. The performances break all barriers for Limitless. Despite his rising status as part of The Hangover money machine Cooper still possesses enough everyman charm and relative anonymity to pull off a character like Eddie who is smart enough even without NZT to know hes pushing his luck. Hes ideally matched with De Niro playing the canny Wall Streeter Carl Van Loon for whom Dixon has penned some of the best dialogue De Niro has had since Goodfellas. His ""Dont make me your competition"" speech to Eddie could become a quotable riff and so might his warning that a high IQ doesnt trump hard-won wisdom ""Dont make the classic smart persons mistake of thinking no ones smarter than you."" Pity that Abbie Cornish cant join in on the fun. Her role as Eddies skeptical girlfriend Lindy is so scant she might as well be listed in the credits as ""The Girl."" Its a missed opportunity because she proved in the criminally overlooked Candy that she knows her way around a movie fuelled by drugs. She hits the glass ceiling in this male-dominated movie which is another of those unfortunate side effects that nobody wants.

Is there an originality pill he couldve taken instead By Mary Pols MaryPolsMarch 17 2011 Share Read Later Rogue Pictures / Everett CollectionBradley Cooper in Limitless Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Limitless begins with a familiar gimmick our hero in dire straits relating via voice-over how he got into this mess. Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is perched on a ledge high up a New York City skyscraper. Thugs are beating down the door of his penthouse; leaping might be preferable to what theyve got planned. We should be worried about Eddie. If the movie fulfills its emotional duties we should arrive back at this point late in the narrative feeling really upset over the prospect of losing Eddie. But by the end I couldnt have cared less whether or not he went splat. Before you decide Im heartless walk with me through the plot of the slick and senseless Limitless directed by Neil Burger (The Illusionist). Eddie is a grungy aspiring novelist who just cant seem to get any words down on paper. His girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish whose deepening lushness is beginning to recall a young Kathleen Turner) a book editor gives him back his apartment keys; she is done with him. Then he runs into his ex-wifes brother Vernon (Johnny Whitmorth) once upon a time his drug dealer. Vernon has gone upscale but hes still hawking a drug. Its a small clear pill called NZT-48 and he promises Eddie it will make him smarter. Eddie takes it cleans his disgusting apartment and then makes a brilliant start on his novel. Enhanced Eddie is so great that he goes back for more NZT. He gets a firsthand look at how dangerous Vernons business is yet he keeps popping the pills. The novel is done in four days and then its onward and upward to language fluency concert piano playing and driving cars really fast without hitting anything. Who needs to write more books when you have super reflexes and powers of deductive reasoning? Eddie tells us in voice-over that he was ready for something bigger ""Mere lounging wasnt enough."" Oh the places hell go With a prescription for NZT I guess I might start with trying to cure cancer helping to resolve the nuclear crisis in Japan or if I were feeling greedy besting Steve Jobs at making gizmos. But not Eddie. Instead he heads for Wall Street where he does some show-offy day trading fattens his bank account and gets into business bed with a mercurial sort named Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) who needs help brokering the biggest corporate merger of all time. Such glory. Albert Einstein should have been so bold. Whats next? Smarter layoffs and better downsizing? As a bonus Eddie reconciles with Lindy who gratifyingly tells him that shes both proud of him and ""a little intimidated."" The whole thing is like a frat boys dream of 1990s success. It is pointless to complain about a plot point simply because it isnt in line with ones own value system. (Maybe Alan Glynn who wrote The Dark Fields the 2001 novel Limitless is based on and screenwriter Leslie Dixon were heavily influenced by Pretty Woman in which the modern-day Prince Charming was a corporate raider.) But this one takes the witty joy out of Eddies exploration of his potential -- the first part of the movie has the zippy energy and humor of Jay McInerneys Bright Lights Big City -- and sidetracks us into a corporate story line that feels dated and defies logic. We never for instance understand the hold Van Loon seems to exert on Eddie. Hungover from an epic NZT bender -- blackouts and fast-forward motion are some of its side effects as well as you know aging really fast and dying -- Eddie tries to skip a meeting with Van Loon. There is no explanation for why this genius would be compelled to show up yet he does. Why? In all likelihood it is because every scene with Van Loon means more screen time for De Niro. More time for him to wince grimace and grumble like a guy parodying himself. He doesnt add gravitas; he adds grimitas. As for Cooper possessed of wolfish good looks and piercing blue eyes there is no denying hes magnetic. But that magnetism works best in a crowd as in The Hangover where he was the hilariously sleazy glue holding a hapless group of guys together. A bright shiny penny of a man he needs some dull pennies around him for contrast. Similarly Limitless -- with its camera tricks (vomiting upside down as well as shots that suggest the camera is a freight train barreling down the sidewalk) and CGI stunts (three-dimensional letters falling like snow in Eddies apartment while hes writing) -- is more style than substance. It feels vapid even when its trying to persuade us of the nefarious significance of NZT in large part because the screenplay is so indecisive about the drug. Its addictive or maybe it isnt. Itll age you and then kill you or maybe not. Youre stupid without it or maybe you arent. There are no happy endings on NZT. Or maybe there are. Is it too much to ask that a movie about a pill that makes you smarter swallow a little of its own medicine?

A sleek black comedy built for speed its about a pill which when ingested makes you the smartest person in any given room. (In other words its a metaphor for the recreational cocaine era of the 1980s.) Would a healthy supply of such pills transform you into a hero or a jerk?Bradley Cooper plays the initially hapless and then superhumanly gifted Manhattan novelist and stock market wizard. Halfway between heroism and jerkdom This is where Coopers sweet spot lies.The actors confidence (or arrogance depending on your perspective) has a way of getting an audience on his side against an audiences better judgment. Cooper qualifies as a fairly sudden sort of movie star having been boosted into theoretical box-office reliability by the success of ""The Hangover."" Armed with super-blue eyes and a blinding smile he brings to the screen an aura of ""Get outta my spotlight or Ill have my goons make you get out."" Yet Coopers an able light comic performer as well as a shrewd dramatic actor and ""Limitless"" lets him run considerable distances in both directions.The novelist Eddie owes his editor a book which he fails to produce in his drab little rental in New York Citys Chinatown. His girlfriend played by Abbie Cornish (lately of ""Bright Star"") has put up with a lot of frustration and early on dumps his sorry behind. By chance Eddie runs into his ex-brother-in-law who slips Eddie a pill by the name of NZT. Alakazam Fortunes can be made overnight. Languages can be learned in a day or two. Women can be pleasured with exceptional finesse because Eddie read something in some magazine years ago and poof there it is drawn from the recesses of his memory as if by pharmaceutical magic.Eddie scores in the market so well that Wall Street mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert de Niro) demands a partnership. The drug Eddies new best friend comes with some side effects including dementia blackouts and death. But without them without the Jekyll-and-Hyde personality changes Eddie undergoes and without the Russian gangster (Andrew Howard) bent on payback for his initial loan to Eddie ""Limitless"" would be a premise not a feature.Director Neil Burger uses endless forward-zoom effects and 360-degree panoramic spins to put us behind Eddies eyes when hes on the drug. ""I dont have delusions of grandeur"" Eddie says at one point. ""I have an actual recipe for grandeur."" Screenwriter Leslie Dixon has done a smart and often witty job in distilling the novel down to movie form.I wish it didnt get quite so movie-stupid toward the end with the violence. And I wish it had the guts to stay tough-minded. The film celebrates reckless charming visionaries who say things like ""Were wired to overreach."" The book had its opinion on such self-aggrandizement. The movie comes to a different conclusion.But its fun getting there.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for thematic material involving a drug violence including disturbing images sexuality and language)Cast Bradley Cooper (Eddie Morra); Robert de Niro (Carl Van Loon); Abbie Cornish (Lindy); Anna Friel (Melissa); Andrew Howard (Gennady)Credits Directed by Neil Burger; written by Leslie Dixon based on the novel ""The Dark Fields"" by Alan Glynn; produced by Dixon Scott Kroopf and Ryan Kavanaugh.

"Limitless (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Limitless (PG-13) Supposedly brainy thriller still resorts to the same-old Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald3/16/2011 Editor rating 2 ""I dont have delusions of grandeur"" brags Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) the brash hero of Limitless. ""I have a recipe for grandeur."" Actually what Eddie has is a big stash of translucent pills -- a new drug called NZT-48 not yet approved by the FDA -- that allows users to access 100 percent of their brains instead of the often-quoted (and mythical) 10 percent. This means that Eddie formerly a shambling novelist with terminal writers block can now write a book in four days; learn to play the piano in three; pick up languages just from hearing someone speak and even perform some ferocious kung-fu by drawing on his memories of Bruce Lee movies. Such a pill if it existed would be the miracle drug everybody wanted and Eddie who got his supply from his late brother-in-law soon discovers hes not the only junkie desperately hooked on NZT. Whats worse the more pills Eddie pops the greater the side effects -- including but not limited to an extended blackout during which he may have murdered a woman. Based on a novel by Alan Glynn and directed with much flash and style by Neil Burger (The Illusionist) Limitless is an exceptionally busy movie. In addition to its various action and thriller plotlines the film must make time for Eddies reconciliation with his ex-girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) and his partnership with a tycoon (a wasted Robert De Niro) who wants to harness the eggheads brain waves for profit. Eddie becomes so smart that he starts to predict the future -- a handy skill for Gordon Gekko or the X-Men but another instance in which this movie about super-intelligence makes no sense whatsoever. The story moves as quickly as the brainiac hero whose new power demands that he remain in a state of perpetual activity or explode (figuratively). To convey the speed of Eddies thoughts Burger employs a slew of nifty special effects including a new kind of zoom shot that covers miles of Manhattan in a single breathtaking rush. But for all its peripatetic energy Limitless still winds up with the same-old blazing guns and wanton destruction of property. No matter how smart you may be Hollywood will figure out a way to dumb you down. Cast Bradley Cooper Robert De Niro Abbie Cornish Andrew Howard Anna Friel Johnny Whitworth. Director Neil Burger. Screenwriter Leslie Dixon. Based on the novel The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn. Producers Leslie Dixon Ryan Kavanaugh Scott Kroopf. A Relativity Media release. Running time 105 minutes.

Limitless Director Neil Burger. Cast Bradley Cooper Robert De Niro Abbie Cornish. Rating PG-13 for thematic material involving a drug violence including disturbing images sexuality and language. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb But what if there were a drug that allowed you access to all of it? You could learn new languages in a day if not sooner; unlock the mysteries of the stock market; tap every ounce of potential available to you. Would you take such a drug? >> De Niro on his Limitless career Of course you would. But theres a cost for everything and not just financial. What would you be willing to pay for such a gift? Warning The price is steep. Thats the quandary at the heart of ""Limitless"" director Neil Burgers film thats entertaining and surprisingly effective. Some of its conceits may not hold up under intense scrutiny but generally speaking its a good time at the movies. Bradley Cooper plays Eddie Morra an aimless would-be writer who despite getting an advance from a publisher cant pull the trigger on actually writing his book. Not a word of it. He gets dumped early on by his far-more-together girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) and is heading back to his grimy New York apartment when he runs into his former brother-in-law Vernon (Johnny Whitworth). Over drinks Vernon a former drug dealer notes how bad Eddie looks (making Cooper look disheveled is no easy feat but long dirty hair a bit of a gut and an unshaven face get the point across). Maybe hed like to try one hit of NZT? It unlocks your potential Vernon explains in almost unimaginable ways. Eddie is dubious but with little to lose he eventually tries it - one pill. And within minutes he has access to every piece of information his brain has ever processed even things he wasnt aware of. He scours his apartment he writes a brilliant chapter of his book he handles his overdue-rent situation in a ahem creative way. His world is just brighter - literally. Burger has to this point shot the film in drab grays and blues emphasizing the colorless life Eddie has been leading. But when he takes NZT oranges and yellows appear bathing the screen in light. And the next day Eddie wakes up and the world is gray and blue again. He wants - needs - more NZT so he visits Vernon. Soon Eddie learns hes not the only one who wants more. He also learns the lengths that people are willing to go to get it. He does score a big stash of the stuff though and soon is making money hand over fist in the stock market. This attracts the notice of Wall Street (and its regulators) most importantly that of the powerful Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro thankfully playing a role worthy of him). Van Loon wants Eddies expertise he wants his knowledge - he wants his secret. Eddies not giving that away but he is crashing beginning to suffer side effects. Erratic behavior he cant remember scares him understandably but hes working a monster deal with Van Loon. He needs more but what will it do to him? Events force him to come clean with Lindy and for her to sample the drug. She hates it - when she was on it she wasnt really herself she says. Eddie argues that he is just an enhanced version. But they dont have time for much arguing; by this time all kinds of people are after Eddie and its clear they arent a patient bunch. The film loses some steam as it becomes more and more an action thriller and the ending is almost necessarily messy as often is the case with these kinds of films. But up to that point the premise is intriguing enough and the execution good enough that the flaws arent fatal to the films success. De Niros character might not rise to the level of Travis Bickle or Jake La Motta but its far above the likes of Jack Byrnes in the ""Focker"" franchise. And he has a scene in which Van Loon explains the facts of financial life to Eddie that makes you realize that De Niro can still bring it. As for Cooper hes finally given a role that allows him to be something more than bland and handsome. The struggling writer is such a cliched conceit that its hard to bring much new to it; Burger wisely casts that off fairly quickly and lets Cooper become something else - a man whos suddenly without limits which both thrills and terrifies him. A great movie? No. And the title is ultimately misleading. ""Limitless"" does have limits as a film. But it also has enough strengths to overcome them.

But in Limitless a potently fanciful and fun thriller about a drug that turns you into a genius Cooper proves a cock-of-the-walk movie star. He plays Eddie a scraggly aspiring novelist who gets hold of an untested pharmaceutical pill called NZT that invites its user to turn on his brain -- i.e. to activate the fabled other 80 percent of mental agility that (according to neuroscience) none of us use. Popping the pill Eddie feels like hes jacked up on cocaine or speed but its really his synapses crackling with all the stored memories and connections that are usually kept unconscious. Suddenly he can talk about anything and Cooper his blue eyes lit up like lasers his words twitchy with eager command rules everyone he sees a landlords pesky wife a crew of Eurotrash revelers the players of Wall Street. As Eddie cleans up his act Cooper in natty dark suits gives a performance too intense to be funny. Hes so charismatic in his verbal seductions that he suggests a faster version of the young Mickey Rourke. NZT of course is too good to be true and Eddie must suffer the consequences which arrive in classic thriller form a strange man tailing him a Russian loan shark who wants his supply of the drug and an increasingly dicey relationship with Carl Van Loon a corporate tycoon played with enjoyably dry distemper by Robert De Niro. Limitless just wants to give you a good time and it does yet the film leaves you wondering Now that our world has been saturated with antidepressants is this where big pharma strikes next?

With long disheveled locks and matching facial scruff novelist Eddie (Bradley Cooper) struggles with writers block until he runs into his ex-brother-in-law Vernon (Johnny Whitworth). Over a subsequent Midtown Manhattan drink Eddie is offered a clear tablet dubbed NZT that has supposedly been approved by the FDA (it hasnt) and that is capable of unlocking the 80 percent of the human brain that is currently unused (it can). Eddie doesnt hesitate to ingest it and the world is suddenly his Colors pop sounds ring out and forgotten memories spring forth from the deep dark recesses of his cranium thereby turning him into a no-prescription-necessary superhero.Even when he finds Vernon executed in his apartment a craving for the designer drug consumes Eddie who doesnt bother to consider the possibly hazardous consequences of his actions. But to be fair why would he when his life is quickly transformed into a jet-setting dream come true full of cliff-jumping fun in the glittering tropics a completed novel that wows his editor and regular opportunities to leave his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) mouth-agape-impressed when he orders food in fluent Italian and Chinese.The skys the limit for Eddie and director Neil Burger (The Illusionist The Lucky Ones) revels in his protagonists newfound abilities via all manner of cinematographic showing off. Telescopic zooms through bustling NYC streets fish lenses CG-enhanced temporal skips and jumps X-ray images of Eddie consuming pills and a cascade of letters falling around the newly inspired writer are just a few of the visual embellishments that energize his trip. Yet whereas this enthusiastic depiction of getting high (or ""clear"" as he describes it) would be an ideal means of parodying our narcotized age Burger plays the material for straight thrills. And suspense alas is even rarer than NZT in Limitless thanks to a script (by Leslie Dixon based on an Alan Glynn novel) that introduces threats via the very sort of nonsensical behavior from which four-digit-IQ Eddie should be immune. With careerist motivation and greed following closely on the heels of enhanced mental faculties Eddie delves into the stock market. But though his predictive acumen is high his common sense is low Impatient about the rate of his return he turns to gnarly Eastern European loan shark Gennady (Andrew Howard) for a quick cash infusion spending the rest of the film paying for this absurdly illogical decision.As with so many of the films twists Eddies decision to get into bed with street thugs might have made more sense if the story were interested in either exploring the inevitable hubris that stems from towering intelligence or following through on the early Faustian-bargain undercurrents. Instead Limitless simply hops aboard Eddies wild ride to the penthouse where he helps orchestrate a historic merger for the ridiculously named energy titan Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro sleepwalking once again in a nothing role) while evading Gennady and a mysterious knife-wielding pursuer (Tomas Arana).Failing to be convincing when asked to embody Eddies true pathetic self Cooper otherwise struts about with his usual cockiness an egomaniacal smirk frequently plastered on his face. Eddie is a potentially inspired strung-out Einstein caricature but with unchecked drugging presented as a surefire path to self-actualization and rock-star bliss he instead winds up being merely an unimpeachable hero. Without a complex thought about narcissism merit or addiction Limitless is content to be an empty one-note satire-free fairy tale of avarice and corporate-political ambition--one that ultimately proves incapable of taking the nations current post-economic-crisis pulse.

Daily Edition Login to download Limitless Film Review 900 PM PDT 3/14/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A movie about a ""smart pill"" takes a few dumb plot turns. TWITTER The film which also stars Robert De Niro Abbie Cornish and Anna Friel centers on a down-and-out guy who takes a ""smart pill"" and suddenly becomes a Mega-brain on steroids. Limitless should be so much smarter than it is. The movie is about a down-and-out guy who takes a ""smart pill"" then can instantly write a book in four days learn a language in hours and run rings around lawyers criminals and financial advisers. Hes a Mega-brain on steroids a Superman for the Information Age. He is also a comic reflection of a cultural shift in American perceptions of masculinity that is beginning to value a Bill Gates or Steve Jobs more than a Kobe Bryant or LeBron James. Alas the filmmakers dont use him very smartly. The protagonist is well played by Bradley Cooper who performs the transformations with aplomb yet once the movie turn him into a Mega-brain its makers cant quite figure out what to do with him Do we want him to be funny or serious? First the movie puts him through a few financial magic tricks that look like an audition for Wall Street 3. After this it throws him into a routine paranoid action-thriller. Disappointing. Not so disappointing though that Relativity Media wont see some smart money heading its way as Cooper goes into overdrive in a performance that makes a script by the estimable Leslie Dixon (Outrageous Fortune) and quirky direction by Neil Burger (The Illusionist) seem better than they are. A New York author named Eddie Morra (Cooper) is faced with monumental ""writers block"" -- i.e. he hasnt written a single word of a novel long overdue -- then gets a sweet goodbye from his long-suffering girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish). By chance he runs into his ex-brother-in-law (Johnny Whitworth). Always a slick hustler this Mephistopheles is pushing a new unregulated drug called NZT. Naturally he gives Eddie a sample. This particular pharmaceutical allows Eddie access to 100 percent of his brain. The movie perhaps overstates the possibilities here by giving the ""addict"" not only a phenomenal ability to learn and retain data but also a sixth sense that lets him anticipate future events have knowledge he would not yet possess a charisma his old self lacked and even newfound martial-arts abilities the latter from memories of Bruce Lee movies Okay a few exaggerations but you cut the movie some slack and see how this plays out. The effect apparently wears off in a day so Eddie gets back with his supplier for more pills. The trouble is the supplier is somewhat indisposed -- another client in an even more acute situation has murdered him and tossed his apartment looking for more pills. Fortunately Eddie is able to find the entire drug stash -- interestingly enough without benefit of a smart pill -- enough for many many months. In no time ""enhanced Eddie"" has dashed off his novel speaks Italian to a maitre d bangs every girl he desires and amasses a fortune playing the stock market. His girlfriend now wants him back and a mega-mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) -- gotta love that name -- brings him aboard to mastermind a huge corporate merger. Burger tries all kinds of visual trickery to imagine the hyper flow of information into a highly receptive brain When Eddie is writing letters fall from the ceiling; multiple Eddies are seen performing tasks; flattering light gently bathes Eddies face; and in the most inventive yet strangely unsuccessful gimmick the camera appears to rush through Manhattan streets gobbling up blocks within seconds. Obviously there are going to be side effects to such persistent and strenuous use of a brains synapses. But the movie takes a couple of hard right turns before getting to those side effects. First the author oddly switches careers by becoming the overnight wonder boy of Wall Street a turn that brings the movie to a near halt with computer day trading conferences with brokers meetings with Van Loon and a litany of data and flow charts that stops just short of power-point presentations. Then gangsters and stalkers begin to shadow Eddie. A Russian goon (Andrew Howard) never feels like the right sort of villain for this kind of movie -- and he isnt -- while the stalker turns out a more reliable bad guy but comes into play too late in the movie to be effective. Police also dog Eddie whom they suspect of murdering a young model -- an element that feels like a desperate attempt to up the suspense ante. The consequence of this obsession with genre material is that potentially fruitful plot elements such as Eddies newfound relationship with Libby and his confrontation with an ex-wife (Anna Friel) who suffers from the after-effects of prolonged NZT use get tossed aside. Well filmmakers tell the stories they want to tell but here those choices compromised the movie by their insistence on sticking to known genre elements rather than letting this Faust tale takes a more natural uncharted course. Russian gangsters and Wall Street crooks are so tired by now. Furthermore why would an artist take such a career detour anyway? A hot-shot author throwing off best-sellers every few months and claiming an ungodly celebrity status would not only have been more interesting but more logical to boot. Cooper does deliver the goods nonetheless while Cornish and Friels solid work goes underappreciated. There is a glimmer of an interesting character twist in Howards goon who becomes shrewder in his criminality when he ingests the smart pill but this is never fully developed. In fact if the filmmakers were so determined to stick with a thriller why didnt the writer and goon discover common ground in a rewarding collaboration rather than indulge in a bloody showdown you can see in any number of crude genre movies? Cinematographer Jo Willems deserves credit for trying to shake things up with an inventive visual plan. Ditto that for Patrizia von Brandensteins wide-ranging production design from a miserable Chinatown flat to Mexican Riviera glory homes and a high-security Manhattan loft.

The ultimate you-can-have-it-all fantasy -- a pill allowing users to harness 100% of their brain power -- turns into something close to a nightmare for a rags-to-riches author in the propulsive unexpectedly funny thriller ""Limitless."" Director Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"") and screenwriter-producer Leslie Dixon (""Hairspray"") take a joint leap into different genre territory mixing Tony Scotts dazzle and Martin Scorseses Gotham darkness with just a few stumbles along the way. Bradley Cooper makes further strides toward major stardom spelling excellent early spring returns and socko vid play. First seen standing on the ledge of a Manhattan high rise trying to escape a gang of killers Eddie Morra (Cooper) ponders -- in extensive and generally witty voiceover narration -- the classic irony that once youve realized your dreams there are knives at your back. Pic winds back to the beginning with Eddie at his lowest ebb as he struggles to write a long-overdue book. A chance encounter on the street with Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) the drug-dealing brother of Eddies ex-wife Melissa (Anna Friel) triggers a total reboot of his life. Vernon explains to the skeptical Eddie hes repping a new drug NZT-48 that taps into maximum brain activity firing up all those synapses. He gives Eddie a pill resulting in the first of several scenes combining a heady mixture of wit hallucinatory visual effects and a clever cinematic means of getting into the head of the central character. Though based on Alan Glynns somewhat obscure 2001 novel ""The Dark Fields"" Dixons screenplay suggests a Philip K. Dick-style fiction -- set in the present with slight futurist twists -- and is actually closer to the authors spirit than the recent Dick adaptation ""The Adjustment Bureau."" What makes the film so entertaining is its willingness to go far out with transgressive touches and mind-bending images that take zoom and fish-eye shots to a new technical level as the pill enables Eddie to experience astonishing new degrees of clarity perception and energy. Hooked Eddie wants more which means becoming Vernons errand boy until he finds the dealer brutally murdered. Eddie uncovers Vernons secret stash of NZT-48 and within days he completes his book masters the piano works out like a stud and becomes fluent in a few languages (Cooper does a mean Italian and Mandarin). The catches? Making sure he doesnt OD getting past occasional blackouts and securing a steady supply of the drug. Plus on-and-off g.f. Lindy (Abbie Cornish underused) takes one look at her transformed guy in his Tom Ford suit and admits to feeling intimidated. The films tone is momentarily thrown off by a poorly staged chase through Central Park with Lindy trying to elude the so-called Man in Tan Coat (Tomas Arana) in a sequence that plays like a bad Brian De Palma spoof. More effective is the fable of Wall Street greed underlying the action which develops engrossing layers thanks in no small part to the arrival of a re-energized Robert De Niro as financial tycoon Carl Van Loon. De Niro and Cooper mix it up quite well with the older thesp delivering possibly his best screen monologue in years as Van Loon portentously informs Eddie whose sudden good fortunate has made him an ace stock trader that he shouldnt even think of trying to compete with him. Feeling heat from a bloodthirsty loan shark (Andrew Howard) Eddie sees his seemingly perfect world begin to implode elevating the film to its most inspired even crazed passage. Going from grungy to ultra-suave with a corresponding shift in attitude Cooper shows off his range in a film he dominates from start to finish. The result is classic Hollywood star magnetism engaging auds physically and vocally as his narration proves to be a crucial element of the pics humor. Howard registers strongly as a thug who maintains a disturbing credibility even at his most over-the-top and Friel makes the most of a brief appearance warning Eddie of the drugs potentially fatal side effects. Cinematographer Jo Willems and a potent f/x team combine for a series of dazzling images that seek to alter visual perception in a way not seen since Scotts ""Deja Vu."" As if theyd taken a few pills of their own editors Naomi Geraghty and Tracy Adams set a relentless tempo supported by Paul Leonard-Morgans keenly judged electronic score.
