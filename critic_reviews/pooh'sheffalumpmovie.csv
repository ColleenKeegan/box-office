While the original joke was that the trumpeting Heffalump turned out to be Pooh with his head in a honey pot this tenth in the Disney series has Roo befriending baby Lumpy (an elephant it seems) on a lone Heffalump hunting trip. The fun ends when the two young uns cant find their mummies and Lumpy is as scared of Pooh Rabbit Tigger and co as they are of him. Lessons are duly learnt about fear of the unknown and its a sweet enough tale if lacking in tension. But while the simple character animation has its endearing moments (Piglets shivering Roos happy-sleepy face etc.) the sentimental soundtrack could prove too much for some. Roos words When I dont feel good my mum sings to me are liable to strike fear into hearts that have been beating eight years or more.

Cute cuddly wholesome and well-intentioned -- all this youd expect from a movie starring Winnie the Pooh and Co. Walking into ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" though youll also get a parable about prejudice that could easily apply to todays heightened fears about homeland security. Little kids wont notice. Theyll be too enraptured by the bouncy slapstick adventures of Pooh and his animated buddies in the Hundred Acre Wood. But oh yes its right there in front of you as plain as Pooh Bears beloved hunny pots. The source of their fear comes one morning when Pooh (voiced by Jim Cummings) and the other A.A. Milne creatures hear a noise that rattles their usual idyll. The crotchety Rabbit (Ken Samson) tells his crew the sound could only have been made by a Heffalump an evildoer with ""fiery eyes and a tail with a spike"" which is ""wide as a river and tall as a tree"" as the ""The Horribly Hazardous Heffalumps"" song goes. Little Roo (Nikita Hopkins) isnt scared. He thinks it sounds ""neat"" and wants to tag along with the big kids on their Heffalump hunting expedition which the Rumsfeldian Rabbit has orchestrated complete with elaborate traps that make the best use of his troops natural ground game. Tigger (also Cummings) Piglet (John Fiedler) and the guys have told Roo hes too young to join them in battle. But Roo sneaks off on his own runs into one of these Heffalumps and quickly realizes theres nothing to be afraid of. Its a goofy kid like him named Lumpy (Kyle Stanger) who looks like a lavender baby elephant and speaks with a British accent. As the mismatched new friends run around the woods together Lumpy divulges that he has seen Roos pals and he thinks theyre terrifying too. Xenophobia is bad we learn from director Frank Nissens movie which was written by Brian Hohlfeld and Evan Spiliotopoulos. Singing Carly Simon songs in the forest and returning home when your mommy calls is good. (Kath Soucie provides the voice of Roos mom Kanga and Brenda Blethyn voices the formidable Mama Heffalump. Who wouldnt answer her call?) It may sound innocent and overly simplistic -- and it is -- but its brief running time and feel-good message make it ideally suited for the littlest Roos out there and their patient parents. During a time in which wall-to-wall pop culture references have become the standard in animated family fare its refreshing to find not a single drop of irony here. ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" is rated G. Running time 68 minutes.

"Heffalump Warm and Fuzzy washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Heffalump Warm and Fuzzy Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Jen Chaney Special to The Washington Post Friday February 11 2005 EVEN THE HARDEST-hearted critic cant possibly malign ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" a benign baby blanket of a film about embracing those who seem a little different. If a writer did feel compelled to scrutinize this sweet-natured story what would she say anyway? ""Despite all the buzz surrounding his performance I was unimpressed by Eeyores exploration of the depressed-donkey psyche. And Pooh -- who brought such masculine charisma to Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too -- sleepwalks through this picture like a bear whos gotten too big for his top-billing britches."" Please. Were talking about Pooh Piglet and the rest of the gang from the Hundred Acre Wood. Their goal is to make little children chuckle and maybe teach them a lesson or two. Objecting to them is like staging a protest against wide-eyed innocence. Fortunately theres little need to harrumph over ""Poohs Heffalump Movie."" Sure its running time is on the short side (68 minutes to be exact). And yes you can see the plot developments and the honey-coated moral coming from an A.A. Milne mile away. But theres something refreshing about a traditional animated movie that tells an old-fashioned story without attempting to win over adults with double entendres or pop-culture references. Plus 5-year-olds just love saying the word ""heffalump."" Poohs name may be in the title but its Roo -- the tiny adorable son of the doting Kanga -- whos really the star here. After a heffalump -- an ominous-sounding creature that turns out to be a lavender-colored elephant with a British accent -- trounces through the neighborhood everyone in the Hundred Acre Wood goes into high-alert mode. With the ever-alarmist Rabbit leading the charge Pooh and his posse set out to capture the seemingly destructive animal. Roo is eager to tag along but the others tell him hes too young. Naturally he goes on a solo expedition which leads him to a playful young heffalump nicknamed Lumpy (voiced with charm by Kyle Stanger). If youre thinking that the two become fast friends while gentle music composed and performed by Carly Simon plays on the soundtrack then clearly you know your Pooh. The narrative is amusing and straightforward Rabbit Tigger and the rest engage in their share of bumbling as they search for the dreaded heffalumps while Roo and Lumpy cavort through their own series of misadventures. Theres nothing groundbreaking here but its all pleasant enough. Its the sort of mild feature that makes a fine first moviegoing experience for tots Nothing will cause nightmares and the whole thing wraps up before any squirming can kick into overdrive. Also beneath all the cuteness the film communicates subtle messages -- like a respect for wildlife -- without being overly preachy. Actually the most important lesson ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" advocates is one of tolerance. But dont tell any of those groups who recently sounded alarm bells about SpongeBob SquarePants and a ""controversial"" episode of PBSs ""Postcards From Buster."" They might mount a letter-writing campaign against ""Heffalump."" As Pooh himself might say ""Oh bother."" POOHS HEFFALUMP MOVIE (G 68 minutes) -- Contains nothing objectionable. Area theaters.

"Winnie-the-Pooh and Heffalump Too washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Winnie-the-Pooh and Heffalump Too Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 11 2005 Purists might see ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" as yet another Disney desecration of the cherished Winnie-the-Pooh books created by A.A. Milne in the 1920s but lets face it Parents arent purists. They are interested only in What Works -- in this case what movie when it comes out on video will buy them that precious hour to return phone calls pay bills or clean the kitchen unmolested and -- more important -- unencumbered by guilt over resorting to the electronic nanny. Is ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" a suitable homage to Milnes vision? Is the Heffalump -- shown for the first time here -- conceived and drafted with the same delicacy and subtle whimsy as Ernest H. Shepards original illustrations? Should Poohs name really be in the title when Roo steals the movie like a tiny big-eared bandit? Who cares? All this reviewer knows is that the 3-year-old who accompanied her to a recent screening didnt squirm wriggle sigh or betray any other signs of distraction or restlessness in the course of the movies 68-minute running time. In other words It Works. And its not half bad either. ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" begins as the Hundred Acre Wood is being shaken by the clomping footsteps of the notorious Heffalump long the unseen bete noire of Pooh Piglet Eeyore Tigger Rabbit Kanga and little Roo. When the Woods creatures gather to discuss the recent un-sighting its decided to form a posse to capture the dreaded monster once and for all. When Roo is told that hes too young to join he sets off on his own a journey that results in his meeting and befriending an actual Heffalump. Its a letdown that the Disney animators have apparently decided to construct that mythical creature from outtakes of ""Barney amp; Friends"" and the ""Dumbo"" sequence ""Pink Elephants on Parade."" Although its true that any addition to the Hundred Acre Wood is destined to look out of place the lavender elephant -- whose only fanciful feature is a bunny tail -- seems particularly crudely realized compared with the others. Still ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" is often lovely to look at and listen to thanks mostly to a design and musical score that hark back to animation at its most classical. (The films musical set piece a song by Carly Simon can safely be entered on the list of Songs That We Can Hear From Another Room Without Wanting to Shoot the TV.) And its a nice touch that the Heffalumps are voiced by British actors whose lilting accents add to the movies overall soothing tone. Of course no kids movie can claim its bona fides without an underlying message; in this case Roos fear of and eventual friendship with the Heffalump serves as a surprisingly timely allegory about nationalism xenophobia and embracing cultural differences. As Pooh wisely observes ""It seems that both sides of the fence are about the same."" Go ahead Mom and Dad -- plop Junior in front of ""Heffalump"" with a clear conscience. You can explain the nuances of moral relativism later when hes 10. Poohs Heffalump Movie (68 minutes at area theaters) is rated G.

Modest and muted pic wont be around long in theatrical run but should prove quite popular down the line as the homevid equivalent of a pacifier. So insubstantial that it practically evaporates on screen ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" likely will play best with toddlers and pre-schoolers easily amused by bright colors merry songs and lovable huggable toon animals. One of the lesser entries in Disneys ongoing ""Winnie the Pooh"" franchise modest and muted pic wont be around long in theatrical run but should prove quite popular down the line as the homevid equivalent of a pacifier. While Christopher Robin makes only a token appearance during closing credits most other popular A.A. Milne characters are on hand to go through familiar paces in Hundred Acre Wood. Wispy scenario calls for Pooh (voiced by Jim Cummings) Tigger (also Cummings) Piglet (John Fiedler) Rabbit (Ken Sansom) and Eeyore (Peter Cullen) to be greatly distressed by evidence that a dreaded ""Heffalump"" (i.e. elephant) has been roaming in their general vicinity. While Team Pooh attempts to capture the dangerous creature in a far-flung corner of the wood spunky little Roo (Nikita Hopkins) befriends a not-so-dangerous young Heffalump named Lumpy (Kyle Stanger). As the new buddies gambol and frolic to the strains of Carly Simons pleasantly innocuous original tunes they find theyre not so different after all. Better still their peaceful coexistence inspires greater trust between their initially mistrustful elders. Even though it clocks in at 67 minutes including credits ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" feels unduly padded. Indeed its hard to shake the impression the project was intended as a direct-to-video release and somehow got misrouted on its way to retail outlets. Overall animation is unremarkably bland with backgrounds and landscapes conspicuously lacking detail. Vocal talents -- including Brenda Blethyn as Mama Heffalump and Kath Soucie as Kanga Roos mommy -- arent unduly taxed. Of course in this age of the Professionally Outraged its altogether possible that some pressure group will huff and puff about ""Heffalump."" After all pic preaches a message of tolerance and mutual acceptance while dealing with a lavender elephant -- no Im not making this up -- whos ultimately embraced by ""normal"" animals of more traditional hues. Wait until the folks who were upset by Teletubbies and Buster Rabbit get a load of this.

The inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood get a new neighbor in Poohs Heffalump Movie. Disney With catchy songs by Carly Simon and an uplifting theme of accepting others differences and overcoming prejudice its just the ticket for parents concerned about negative messages their little ones are absorbing. Some Pooh purists (pooh-rists?) might complain because heffalumps menaces in their rare appearances in the original Winnie the Pooh cartoon series are de-fanged here. But most parents and young children probably will prefer the sanitized cuddlier version. Pooh and his posse of Hundred Acre Wood denizens -- Tigger Piglet Eeyore and Rabbit -- go off in search of what they think are fearsome marauding creatures the heffalumps who live in a nearby forest. As Pooh has mythologized them they have three horns and claws. About the movie Poohs Heffalump Movie    (out of four) Voices Jim Cummings John Fiedler Nikita Hopkins Kath Soucie Brenda Blethyn Kyle Stanger Directors Frank Nissen Distributor Walt Disney Rated G Opens Friday nationwide Roo the endearing little kangaroo (voiced likably by Nikita Hopkins) who is too young to go along on the older animals adventure sneaks off and forges an unexpected friendship with a rambunctious young heffalump named Lumpy. With his infectious giggle Lumpy steals the show. He has an adorably childish British accent as voiced by newcomer Kyle Stanger who was 5 when he recorded the voice-over. While Roo and Lumpy are playing the older male animals are being tripped up by their fears as they try to capture a heffalump. In the meantime Roo has realized that heffalumps are not to be dreaded. They are merely large purple elephant-like animals. Its a stretch but theres even a kind of anti-war message about the foolishness of going off to conquer those that seem different and therefore threatening. Not only is the sweet story entertaining and the music enjoyable but given the fragility of todays world the message also is far more substantial than indicated by the movies anemic ad campaign of ""Heffa nice day."" (That tagline conjures up unlikely images of Playboys Hef the antithesis of a playful heffalump.) You cant help but like a movie in which kids and their moms emerge as heroes. Both Roo and Lumpy have reasonable and loving moms (Kath Soucie and Brenda Blethyn) who insist on keeping cool heads while Pooh and friends are ready to string up their supposed nemeses. A sub-theme in the movie is ""Listen to your mom"" which is bound to please the parents in the audience. But ultimately its the childrens innocence innate wisdom and exuberance that teach the adults a thing or two.

Watch Entertainment CONSPIRACY11 ""Conspiracy of Silence."" Watch Entertainment FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Conspiracy of Silence Drama. Starring Jonathan Forbes Jason Barry and Brenda Fricker. Written and directed by John Deery. (Not rated. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). As Mel Gibson proved passion for a subject will carry a filmmaker far. But writer-director John Deerys obviously strong feeling that the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church is running a once-great institution into the ground often undermines ""Conspiracy of Silence."" The need to portray the powers-that-be at all levels -- from the Vatican to the local parish -- in the worst possible light intrudes upon the movie making it feel like a personal vendetta. That said ""Conspiracy"" also is an act of courage on the part of Deery and his uniformly fine cast of Irish and British actors who one senses signed on not merely to collect a paycheck but to make a statement. Inspired by the real-life suicide of a priest in a working-class town in Ireland the film takes particular exception to the Catholic Church turning its back on priests living with HIV and AIDS. To acknowledge them of course would seem to be a tacit admission of homosexuality in the priesthood. This is evidently a big controversy within the Church even if it doesnt grab headlines the way pedophilia does. To give ""Conspiracy"" an edge Deery has concocted an investigative reporter in the Woodward/Bernstein mold. David (Jason Barry) works for a local Irish paper and is the first to suspect a link between the suicide of a favorite priest and the expulsion of a seminarian named Daniel (Jonathan Forbes) for being seen leaving a fellow students room late at night. The suspicion completely unfounded is that the two are sexually involved. As Daniels stern mother Brenda Fricker shows that shes still the scene- stealer she was in her Oscar winning performance in ""My Left Foot."" Daniel who truly believes he has a calling gets no comfort from Mom when his dream is unfairly snatched away. The ease with which he finds comfort in the arms of a local girl seems to belie his commitment to the cloth. His night of passion does however underscore ""Conspiracys"" none-too-subtle message -- that celibacy is a burden on priests and that if the Catholic Church were wise (which the movie gives little evidence of) it would eliminate such an unrealistic requirement. -- Advisory This film contains nudity. - Ruthe Stein Poohs Heffalump Movie Cartoon. Starring the voices of Jim Cummings John Fielder and David Ogden Stiers. Directed by Frank Nissen. (G 68 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). Perhaps we should all be happy that films such as ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" are still being made. Its a cartoon where parents dont have to worry about corrupting little ones with adult-skewed pop culture references a rap music soundtrack or some woodland creatures mother getting blown away in the first five minutes. But its the absence of all of the above that will have anyone over the age of eight squirming in their seats even as the youngest demographics are transfixed by the latest adventure for Winnie the Pooh Tigger and their friends. Pooh gets his name on the marquee but hes phoning it in here sort of like Willem Dafoe in ""Spider-Man."" ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" should really be called ""Roos Big Movie"" with the overly caffeinated little marsupial dominating screen time. A Heffalump has invaded the Hundred Acre Wood forcing Tigger Eeyore Rabbit and Winnie to come together as a posse and capture the giant elephant- like creature. When Roo gets left behind because hes too young he goes out on his own befriends a younger Heffalump and together they teach everyone that its not right to hate people just because theyre scary and different. In a world where small children dont need chaperones there would be little to pick apart in ""Poohs Heffalump Movie."" No doubt kindergarteners wont spend recess next week discussing the weak animation and maudlin songwriting. But beyond a small demographic of Family Circus-clipping grandparents who live for this stuff most adults will become fidgety in the first 15 minutes nervously checking their watches to see when the next Pixar movie is coming out. There are a few amusing bits most involving the underutilized Tigger but any sort of groove is lost whenever one of the characters breaks into a song. Carly Simon composed the music and sings and while her output in the ""Pooh"" movies is not as bad as the Phil Collins animated soundtrack oeuvre theres no ""Anticipation"" here or even ""Let the River Run."" (While rumors have been spreading that ""Youre So Vain"" is really about Rabbit no answers are offered in ""Poohs Heffalump Movie."") The cartoon is bound to become much more entertaining when the Christian right gets wind of the content. With the pink and purple Heffalumps the tendency for Pooh and his friends to wear shirts yet no pants and Roos apparently single mother this movie makes ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" look like an NRA recruitment video. -- Peter Hartlaub Game Over Kasparov and the Machine Documentary. Starring Garry Kasparov. Directed by Vikram Jayanti. (Not rated 86 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.). Vikram Jayanti doesnt have any proof that the humans backing Deep Blue cheated when the IBM supercomputer defeated Garry Kasparov in a historic 1997 chess exhibition. But Jayanti has an impressive collection of sinister background music. The director of ""Game Over Kasparov and the Machine"" uses that music bizarre whispering voice-overs and various tricks with the camera to sully an otherwise informative documentary about an intriguing moment in history that most people probably overlooked. ""Game Over"" is best when the music stops and the sport and its greatest champion are placed in their proper context. Kasparov is featured prominently in the film and hes an intriguing figure still showing signs of bitterness and paranoia as he visits ""the scene of the crime"" -- where he was defeated in a man-versus-machine match notable for its suspicious circumstances. The facts alone are enough to make IBM look bad. According to the film the company declined to provide computer printouts it had promised didnt offer a rematch and benefited with a stock surge after the controversial victory -- all bolstering Kasparovs insinuations that human grand master chess players helped the machine. Jayantis decision to back Kasparovs theory isnt the problem. But where advocate documentarians Michael Moore and Morgan ""Super Size Me"" Spurlock at least attempt to confront their opponents Jayanti shows little interest in investigation. After the interesting chess lesson is done in ""Game Over"" all Jayanti has left is a film with one big question and no visible attempt to find any answers. In their place is a layered atmosphere of insinuation from the quasi- ""X- Files"" background music to ""Citizen Kane"" camera angles and nightmare-inducing clips from 1927 of a creepy chess-playing doll that was actually controlled by magicians. All thats missing is video of an IBM computer holding a bloody knife. -- Peter Hartlaub Ong-Bak The Thai Warrior Martial arts action. Starring Tony Jaa. Co-written directed by Prachya Pinkeaw. In Thai with English subtitles. (Rated R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). Instant replay is good in the NFL and it should be implemented in college football as well. In action movies its a very bad idea. The amazing Tony Jaa a throwback to Bruce Lee and early Jackie Chan is the reason to see the thuggishly directed ""Ong-Bak The Thai Warrior"" already an international hit before its U.S. wide release. His stunt work -- all genuine unaided by wire work or digital effects as we are told before the opening titles -- is truly exciting. Jaa a disciple of the Muay Thai art of combat kicks and punches powerfully; he also leaps rolls flips jumps and at one point when cornered in an alley by his pursuers with seemingly no way out he skips across their shoulders and heads and out of danger before they know what hit them. No wonder Magnolia Pictures has decided to open it in wide release despite the Thai language with English subtitles; in the era of ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Hero"" its starting to make sense to put these foreign action flicks in the multiplexes. The trouble with ""Ong-Bak"" is that director Prachya Pinkeaw is clearly as captivated by his star as he wants us to be. Nearly every impressive stunt is repeated in slow motion from a different camera angle and we get to see the most eye-popping ones three times. Thus a tightly edited 90-minute action flick becomes a bloated 105-minute exercise on how not to direct an action film. Jaa plays Ting the disciple of a monk in a poor village that worships at the altar of their Buddha which they call Ong-Bak. When the head of this statue is stolen by street thugs trying to raise drug money Ting volunteers to go to Bangkok and get the statue back before the village can suffer a run a bad luck. In Bangkok the country bumpkin looks up George (Petchthai Wongkamlao) a former villager turned petty criminal and traces his quarry to a bar where a crime boss runs the gambling concession on illegal fights. Reluctantly Ting must fight in order to infiltrate the gang and find the head of Ong-Bak; soon Ting realizes his mission is also to save Georges soul which has been corrupted by the big city. Naturally all of the fighters are much bigger more muscle-bound and liberally pierced and tattooed while Ting looks as innocent as a well monks disciple. So in the time-honored tradition of underdog action cinema Tings exploits become ours. With Jaas likable demeanor and innocent charm together with his immense skill its easy to root for him and ""Ong-Bak"" is an agreeable movie even if it works on the level of an early Jean-Claude Van Damme picture. Theres an elaborate scooter chase through the streets of Bangkok and a nifty climax that pays homage to (or steals shamelessly from) Indiana Jones films. The highest compliment of a good action film is that you want to rush out and see it again. Unfortunately with ""Ong-Bak"" theres no need; you already have. -- Advisory Rated R for brutal violence and drug use. -- G. Allen Johnson Swing Drama. Starring Jacqueline Bisset Innis Casey Jonathan Winters and Nell Carter. Directed by Martin Guigui. (PG-13. 104 minutes. At the Lark.). Angels have long been dispatched from heaven to guide muddled movie heroes out of their morass. Anthony Verdi (Innis Casey) an aspiring young musician trapped behind the counter of his fathers grocery store in ""Swing"" got lucky in this department. He receives divine guidance -- not to mention dance lessons -- from a seductive apparition in a low-cut red ball gown played by the lovely Jacqueline Bisset in a platinum blond wig. And to think Jimmy Stewart got stuck with a balding fat guy in ""Its a Wonderful Life."" ""Swing"" a well-intentioned but frequently inert coming-of-age saga springs to life when Anthony and his heavenly adviser Christine rendezvous. They do so at Jimbos a 1940s swing club. The film shot entirely in San Francisco and Oakland is set in the present and it takes the none-too-swift Anthony a while to figure out hes in a time warp and not some hip retro club. Whatever it is Jimbos is jumping. Dazzling swing numbers are performed by pros and the music some of it written for the movie is easy on the ears. The tin dialogue however isnt. Christine tells Anthony that swing is a metaphor for life when everyone knows thats what baseball is supposed to be. The story of a young person torn between an artistic dream and a job with benefits has been better told and Casey isnt a dominant enough screen presence to build a movie around. But ""Swing"" is a showcase for some of its other stars. Bisset ages several decades to show Christine as an old woman trapped in a crumbling body that wont allow her to dance her precious swing. Its a brave performance displaying an admirable lack of vanity. Her best friend in the nursing home is played with subtlety and wit by Jonathan Winters. Nell Carter giving what sadly turned out to be her final performance is touching as the caring director of the home who keeps her elderly charges alert by singing to them. Carters rich vibrant voice truly was a gift from heaven. -- Ruthe Stein Vodka Lemon Comedy. Directed and written by Hiner Saleem. Starring Romen Avinian Lala Sarkissian Ivan Franek Ruzan Mesropyan and Zahal Karielachvili. (Not rated. 88 minutes.In Armenian Russian and Kurdish with English subtitles. At the Balboa.). Words are kept to a minimum in this dark comedy set in the snowy mountains of Armenia where townspeople with hardscrabble lives try to make the most from meager resources. Director Hiner Saleem has created a magical movie that veers even within scenes from love story to tragedy to comic relief. The key character in ""Vodka Lemon"" is Hamo (Romen Avinian) a gray-haired widower who clings to the hope that a son in France will send him money. While he waits Hamo is forced to sell his most treasured possessions at the market where other (younger) Armenians -- more attune to matters of bargaining -- quickly take advantage. When Hamo is not scouring for money hes visiting his wifes grave and talking to her tombstone about their childrens lives and anything else that comes to mind. The only real spark in Hamos life is an attractive dark-haired widow named Nina (Lala Sarkissian) whos in a similarly desperate situation Her job as a cashier at an outdoor vodka stand is numbing oppressive and so unrewarding that she cant afford bus fare to get there and back. Characters in ""Vodka Lemon"" (when they talk) poke fun at their tragic conditions. ""Dont you miss the time when the Russians were still (governing) here?"" one asks. ""No"" says his friend ""we didnt have any freedom then"" -- to which his acquaintance replies ""Maybe. But we had everything else."" Many of the scenes in ""Vodka Lemon"" are just minutes long -- and in fact the movie feels like a series of elliptical (almost poetic) moments that are connected by the narrowest of plots. (Will Hamo ever get together with Nina? Will their offspring find happiness in such isolated economically challenging conditions?) Yet it all works well and from a visual standpoint ""Vodka Lemon"" is stunning especially for its vistas and pastiche of colors (from blue skies and white hill tops in daytime to dark roads at night). For context ""Vodka Lemon"" might be compared to ""Marooned in Iraq"" another dark comedy from another Kurdish filmmaker (Bahman Ghobadi) thats also set in a remote part of the world. Music and roadways are important themes in both films along with an odd silliness thats satisfying to watch. -- Jonathan Curiel Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 9 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 10 Woman at scene of minor crash killed when car hits her Find Showtimes Search Theaters amp; Showtimes -- County -- Alameda Contra Costa Lake Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Santa Clara Solano Sonoma Show Movies Now Playing | Recent Releases | Critics Favorites Rated G | PG | PG-13 | R Latest News Officials believe no survivors in Texas hot air balloon crash Little shake 2.7-magnitude earthquake rattles Bay Area Philippine president calls off truce after rebel attack Ann Coulter slammed for calling war heros dad angry Muslim 4 Sierra plane crash victims were from Tuolumne County Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F.

See next articles See previous articles Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Advertisement Supported by Movies | FILM REVIEW A Monster That Isnt So Monstrous By ANITA GATESFEB. 11 2005 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story In A.A. Milnes Winnie the Pooh stories written in the 1920s Piglet once thought he had seen a heffalump but it was really just Pooh running around with a honey jar stuck on his head. In ""Poohs Heffalump Movie"" which is adorable he finally encounters the real thing. And it (the heffalump) is too cute for words.With traditional Disney animation and the pastel colors of the Hundred Acre Wood where the Pooh tales are set Milnes characters gather again reduced to simple personality types. Piglet is afraid Eeyore is gloomy Tigger is self-involved little Roo is curious and Pooh is Pooh making excuses and being generally clueless. (When Piglet leaves a trail of jelly beans so they wont become lost in the forest Pooh not getting the idea blithely eats them one by one as they go along.)The animals have heard a frightening noise coming from Heffalump Hollow and conclude that it must be one of the areas scary-monster namesakes. Everybody says heffalumps are very frightening dangerous and mean with spiky tails. But the group screws up its collective courage and sets out on an expedition to find and capture one. But its little Roo whom they consider too young to go along who happens upon a heffalump a very young one whose nickname is Lumpy. Roo explains to his find that he has come to capture him. Great capture me Lumpy says agreeably.At this point adults as well as children may fall in love with Lumpy partly because hes a sort of roly-poly lavender baby elephant but even more because of the endearing voice and infectious laugh of Kyle Stanger a very young Briton making his movie and voice-over debut. The other voice-over actors do fine jobs including Brenda Blethyn as Lumpys considerably larger but equally gentle mother. And Carly Simon has written four charming childrens songs for the film three of which she performs. But in the end its all about Kyle age 8 whom I would very much like to adopt.Roo persuades Lumpy to leave his part of the world and come over to the Hundred Acre Wood where they romp giggle and get into a little trouble. When the other animals come across the broken honey pots and the ravaged garden of pumpkins watermelons and carrots they have left behind (the kids were hungry O.K.?) they interpret it as destruction by a frightening creature and set out numerous traps. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Two 4 1/2-year-olds sitting in the row in front of me seemed to be enjoying the film. The loudest childrens laughter in the theater followed Poohs falling out of bed and into a honey pot Tiggers falling on Rabbit and Rabbits being tied up with rope from head to toe.The smallest moviegoers may not realize they are being taught a crucial lesson about fearing the unknown and the dangers of misjudging people just because they are different from you but there it is. ""Hes just like us"" Roo explains to his friends who are initially terrified of Lumpy. ""He gets afraid. He likes honey. He even learned how to bounce.""Poohs Heffalump Movie Opens today nationwide.Directed by Frank Nissen; written by Brian Hohlfeld and Evan Spiliotopoulos based on characters created by A.A. Milne; edited by Nancy Frazen; music by Joel McNeely with songs by Carly Simon; art director Tony Pulham; produced by Jessica Koplos-Miller; released by Walt Disney Pictures. Running time 63 minutes. This film is rated G.WITH THE VOICES OF Jim Cummings (Winnie the Pooh/Tigger) John Fiedler (Piglet) Nikita Hopkins (Roo) Kath Soucie (Kanga) Ken Sansom (Rabbit) Peter Cullen (Eeyore) Brenda Blethyn (Mama Heffalump) and Kyle Stanger (Lumpy).

Not anymore. In Disneys latest expansion of Pooh Corner the already xenophobic Hundred Acre Wood community (remember how they reacted when single-mom Kanga moved in?) gets riled over perceived incursions by these elephantine betes noires long feared but (crucially) never glimpsed. Its a call for Rabbit-sponsored alarm but its also a chance for little Roo (developmentally delayed by all those Carly Simon-penned songs his mother sings him) to prove hes grown-up enough for a Heffa-hunt. When he meets Lumpy (irresistibly voiced by 8-year-old Brit Kyle Stanger) the martial tone softens and lessons of tolerance are learned. What was accomplished with quiet nuance in A. A. Milnes stories (where Roo himself was the outsider) is all melodramatic fanfare here; but if youre willing to accept the initial betrayal of the mythos Poohs Heffalump Movie is a harmless little ""ex-po-tition"" (to use a Pooh-ism). Still making this your kids first Pooh experience would be like weaning them on New Coke.
