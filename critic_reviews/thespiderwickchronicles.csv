"Review Spiderwick is worthwhile journey - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Spiderwick is worthwhile journeyStory Highlights ""Spiderwick Chronicles"" is charming and entertaining Film about a child discovering relatives notes about enchanted creatures Boy must protect house from conniving ogre Presence of old pros like Strathairn Plowright offsets intense sequences Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- A dozen producers share the bragging rights for bringing the popular Holly Black-Tony DiTerlizzi ""Spiderwick"" childrens fantasy books to the screen. That wouldnt necessarily be grounds for optimism so its a relief to report that ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is free of the elephantine designs that bogged down ""The Golden Compass."" Freddie Highmore finds himself face-to-face with Nick Nolte who plays an ogre. Unlike ""Compass"" New Lines luxurious sporadically entertaining misadventure Mark Waters crisp little movie is modestly scaled and keeps the story front and center. Heck it even comes supplied with something called an ending The narrative is tied up characters work through their problems tears are shed all that stuff. The makers of ""Compass"" might want to check it out. Like ""Golden Compass"" ""Spiderwick"" is imprinted with the influence of C.S. Lewis Narnia books. The Grace children -- angry troubled Jared; his sweeter twin brother Simon (both played by Freddie Highmore); and older sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger) -- move into a ramshackle country house with their newly divorced mom (Mary-Louise Parker). The estate once belonged to their great-great-uncle Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) a naturalist whose field research revealed some unexpected new species fairies goblins and the like. Uncle Arthur has long since vanished -- and his daughter Lucinda is now an old lady in the local asylum -- but Jareds discovery of his loosely bound notes reawakens the interest of the terrible ogre Mulgarath (Nick Nolte) who will stop at nothing to get his claws on them if only he and his toadies can break the protective circle that surrounds the house. Mulgarath isnt the only monster in this movie. Jared does a good impersonation of one in the early scenes railing against his mom and taking a switch to the SUV. His home is broken and hes all upset about it. When his sister wakes up to find her hair tied to the bedstead everyone assumes Jared is the culprit. In fact its Thimbletack a ""house brownie"" whose job is to protect Spiderwicks book. A midget-sized hulk voiced by Martin Short Thimbletack can work himself into a green fury unless you sweeten his disposition with generous helpings of honey. Jared also gets some help from Hogsqueal a bird-eating hobgoblin (voiced by Seth Rogen) who has sworn vengeance on Mulgarath and wholl spit in your eye to expose the ogres invisible minions. Waters (""Mean Girls"") hasnt done an effects movie before unless you count ""Freaky Friday"" but hes kept a firm grip on the material and gets impressive performances out of Bolger and Highmore (though its questionable whether it was worth twinning him; Simon -- ""I dont do conflict"" -- is mostly on the sidelines). The storytelling is economical and brisk. In some ways Waters approaches it more as a pre-teen horror movie. The domestic squabbles within the ruptured family are realistic and raw and the climax is like something out of a home-invasion thriller (but with more goo). That said these intense sequences are offset by moments of whimsy and humor by Caleb Deschanels beautiful cinematography James Horners warm score and the benign presence of old pros like Strathairn and Joan Plowright. Incidentally Strathairns regular collaborator indie filmmaker John Sayles is one of three credited screenwriters. Parents of younger children should proceed with caution; this walk in the woods is no picnic. But ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is animated by its anger issues; edgy and brittle its at least a cut above average.

Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Paramount Pictures Director Mark WatersGenre Adventure FantasyRunning Time 97 minutes Watch a clip In this first installment of what will doubtless become a kids fantasy franchise a divorced mom (Mary-Louise Parker) moves with her three kids into the familys abandoned country manse only to discover that its sprite-infested. Great-great-uncle Arthur (David Strathairn) had been writing a faerie-world guidebook ysee -- Arthur Spiderwicks Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You -- when he disappeared some six decades earlier and a neighboring colony of faerie-loathing ogres would love to get their gooey hands on the secrets in it. Happily Arthurs now-elderly daughter Lucinda (Joan Plowright) left a pantry well-stocked with honey tomato sauce and oatmeal before being carted off to the loony bin at the age of 9. And once the kids discover what each of those foodstuffs is good for -- placating certain creatures dissolving others -- they prove resourceful in the art of goblin-repelling. Sarah Bolger (as teenaged Mallory) and Freddie Highmore (doubling as both of her brothers defiant Jared and gentle Simon) fight the digital baddies persuasively enough that youre not thinking about how theyre probably surrounded by green screens. And though director Mark Waters allows the ending to get overwhelmed a bit by special effects all hes really doing is hewing to genre requirements.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Will there be a good movie this year? Do we have to wait till November for Hollywood to unveil the niche prestige items that it saves for Oscar consideration? Is every movie till then doomed to be aimed at the all-important 8-year-old-girl-to-14-year-old-boy demographic? Actually there are a couple of terrific films out there there if you live in New York City Los Angeles or San Francisco. You lucky folks can catch 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days the Romanian abortion drama and The Bands Visit a drily delightful comedy about an Egyptian military orchestra stranded in an Israeli desert town. If you reader are stranded in a city not playing these fine movies youre obliged to see one of the films opening in several thousand theaters and to play a guessing game based on name recognition and advertising. Jumper pits two veteran Jedi knights -- Hayden Christensen aka young Darth Vader and Samuel L. Jackson aka the black guy who didnt have enough to do in that Star Wars trilogy -- against each other in a world-hopping fantasy from director Doug Liman. Its about a teen David who falls into an ice hole and on emerging discovers he has the ability to teleport himself instantly anywhere. He uses this gift to rob banks and live the impossibly good life hanging from the minute hand of Big Ben in London snacking atop the Sphinx in Egypt slipping into the Coliseum after visiting hours then back to his posh Manhattan pad before midnight. A few years into his transformation David learns that his power comes with a price hes stuck in a war between other teleporters (including Billy Elliots Jamie Bell) and their pursuers (mainly Jackson). In this battle of the amoral and the fanatical theres little rooting interest. In fact Jumper is so lame -- undernourished in its characterizations stillborn in its action scenes -- that it inevitably leads the idled mind to wondering how this movie got past the pitch stage. Perhaps Liman was the key. He graduated from Swingers and Go two of the sauciest comedies of the 90s to the high-octane The Bourne Identity which made Matt Damon an action star and Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith which brought Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together with seismic repercussions. So Im tempted to give Liman a pass here -- except that Jumper is so freakin awful. Christensen is a leaden slab whose charisma deprivation made me long for David to be teleported back to his high-school years when he was played by the much more attractive Max Thieriot. The only kind words I can muster are for Diane Lane as Davids mother not that she has much to do in the movie but that after a stint looking soaked and bedraggled in Untraceable shes back to being beautiful again. The eight-year-olds catch a break this weekend. The movie made for them The Spiderwick Chronicles is a decent entertainment -- not up there with the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings sagas but a notch above The Golden Compass and Narnia. The five-novel series on which its based is sort of Narnia-lite. The childrens passage to fantasyland is a steamer trunk instead of a wardrobe but the enchanted garden has similar pleasures and threats. Moving with his family into an old dark house troubled preteen Jared (Freddie Highmore of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) finds a land of fairies and monsters. Into this otherworld he drags his twin brother Simon (also Highmore) and older skeptical sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger such a sweetheart in In America). Like most heroes of boy fiction Jared can be trusted to disobey whatever solemn order he is given by the house-and-garden forces -- such as ""Dont take the book away"" -- but if he wasnt such a stubborn cuss the movie wouldnt be able to display the rush of amazing creatures after him. Some of these may give a scary jolt to the very young; the film mixes lots of horror-movie tremors into its kid-movie sentiment. But its a pleasing melange under the direction of Mark Waters who after Freaky Friday and Mean Girls is becoming the go-to auteur of traumatized youth. Sentiment finally comes to the fore at the end with one of the dearest death scenes youre likely to see in a movie for any age group. It makes Spiderwick a film worth creeping toward. There. That should keep the kids occupied till Iron Man and Indiana Jones knock down the multiplex doors in May.

February 15 2008 Save for later Saved New in theaters The Year My Parents Went on Vacation (NR)Director Cao Hamburger. With Michel Joelsas Germano Haiut. (103 min.) ""The Year My Parents Went on Vacation"" is set in Brazil in 1970 - a time when the country was still reeling from the military dictatorship that staged a coup six years earlier. Twelve-year-old Mauro (Michel Joelsas) has been left in the custody of his Jewish grandfather when his parents are forced into exile - ""vacation"" - for their political beliefs. The grandfather dies and the boy tries to lose himself in the soccermania that grips the country. (This was after all the heyday of Pele and Tostao.) Writer-director Cao Hamburger works well with child actors and has a spare unforced style. But too much of this film is desultory and thin. Grade B- - Peter RainerThe Spiderwick Chronicles (PG) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Director Mark Waters. With Freddie Highmore David Straithairn Mary-Louise Parker. (97 min.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Not that we need another potential fantasy franchise but ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is decidedly better than most. Based on the childrens books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black its an imaginative escapade with rapturous cinematography (by Caleb Deschanel) and first-rate special effects. Freddie Highmore in a double role as twin brothers is the junior mastermind who moves with his teenage sister (Sarah Bolger) and mother (Mary-Louise Parker) into an evacuated Victorian mansion once belonging to a great-great-uncle (David Strathairn) who secretly documented the lives of fairies and ogres - and then vanished. Director Mark Waters does a fine job meshing the fantastical with the quotidian. Joan Plowright has a marvelous cameo as an aunt in a sanitarium. Lesson for today Ogres hate tomato sauce.

"Spiderwicks Web Really Tugs You Down washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments Spiderwicks Web Really Tugs You Down Hogsqueal (voiced by Seth Rogen) and Jared (Freddie Highmore) in the new film that dips into some very dark corners. (Paramount Pictures Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday February 14 2008 Heavy heavy heavy. Those are the words I hastily scrawled in my reporters notebook during a recent screening of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles."" The movie based on a best-selling novel for young people has no doubt been eagerly awaited by the books fans -- who most likely will be well pleased by the filmmakers visualization of the storys many goblins fairies sprites and otherwise otherworldly creatures. This StorySpiderwicks Web Really Tugs You DownFind Spiderwick Showtimes But for the uninitiated? Man its a bummer. The Spiderwick of the chronicles in question would be Arthur a metaphysical explorer who 80 years ago discovered how to see into the supernatural world. He wrote down and illustrated his findings in a leather-bound tome that looks like Guillermo del Toros daily diary. But in making such secrets known he got crosswise with an evil ogre named Mulgarath. Cue time shift to the present day when Arthurs great-niece Helen Grace (Mary-Louise Parker) moves into ye olde Spiderwick estate with twin sons Simon and Jared (Freddie Highmore playing two characters in a neat trick of visual legerdemain) and daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger). As is made clear when the family pulls up to the spooky Victorian pile all is not well on the domestic front. Helen has left the kids dad and the children are dealing with the separation in their own ways. Mallory takes her aggression out by fiercely defending her mother and practicing her fencing skills. Simon the constant conciliator announces ""I dont do conflict."" Its Jared whos got the anger issues sulking with his iPod and lashing out at his mom and sibs with snotty hostility. So when things begin to go haywire in the house everyone assumes its Jareds fault -- who else would tie Mallorys hair to her bedpost or slip keys and valuable items into a hidden dumbwaiter? Soon enough though Jared Simon and Mallory have embarked on a hunt for the ghosties and gobblies who make things go bump in the night (and in the daytime it turns out). Eventually the three Graces meet up with Mulgarath who takes human form in the person of Nick Nolte surprisingly well suited for the job. ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" takes place in the course of one day after Jared discovers Arthurs book meets a brownie named Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) witnesses Simon being kidnapped by the ogres toadlike hench-things rescues him with the aid of a hobgoblin named Hogsqueal (Seth Rogen) escapes the clutches of a dragonlike troll and flies with his brother and sister on the back of a huge griffin to visit Arthur who has been living in suspended animation with dandelion-like creatures called the Sylph. And thats before the big showdown back at the house when carnage ensues and everything explodes into an indeterminate goop of tomato soup and green goblin guts. (At this point Helen has come home from work and joined her kids in battle; Parker wears the very same expression as she does on ""Weeds"" when the DEA is about to raid her characters grow house.) ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" doesnt stint on the ick factor Hogsqueal likes to hock loogies in the Graces faces and with the exception of the odd flowerlike sprite or fairy the creatures are clearly designed for maximum gross-out appeal. Parents might want to be on notice that the action in ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is intense possibly terrifying and even violent making it difficult to recommend as a movie the whole family will love. Still ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" has been executed with competence and good taste by director Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"" ""Freaky Friday"") who has enlisted a commendably classy cast in the effort David Strathairn and Joan Plowright as Arthur and his now-elderly daughter Lucinda add a deep touch of pathos to the proceedings and the young Highmore (""Finding Neverland"") does a credible job of delineating his two temperamentally different characters (although he does something very unattractive with his mouth as Jared an affectation that he will one hopes soon retire). ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is clearly seeking to join the ranks of the Harry Potter Narnia and Hobbit-related fantasy franchises and it should appeal to that fan base. As for its pervasive dark undertones of death divorce and dysfunction I cant help wondering Thats entertainment? The Spiderwick Chronicles (97 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for scary creature action and violence peril and some thematic elements. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Spiderwicks Web Really Tugs You Down Find Spiderwick Showtimes",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/13/AR2008021303525.html,200,thespiderwickchronicles8,thespiderwickchronicles,washingtonpost

At major theatres. PGIs your family dysfunctional? Parents headed for divorce?Siblings at war with each other?You can try family therapy. Or you can do what the Grace family does.Article Continued Below Mother Helen (Mary-Louise Parker) son Jared (Freddie Highmore) twin brother Simon (also Highmore) and older daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger) move into a creepy old house in the woods while dad hangs out with his new girlfriend back home in New York City in The Spiderwick Chronicles.Its either a move guaranteed to push everybody into a state of nervous collapse or allow family members to truly bond depending on how successful they are at fighting off the extremely ugly supernatural beings that come with the property.At first the signs arent good. Jared blames his mother for the divorce and there are sharp exchanges between the two. Mallory sides with mom and tries to push Jared into line. The bookish Simon is desperate to avoid taking sides. ""I dont do conflict"" he says.This is called dramatic irony. Before too long Simon is fighting for his life along with everybody else in the family resisting a home invasion by a crew of goblins led by the ogre-in-chief Mulgarath (Nick Nolte). Based on a popular series of books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black The Spiderwick Chronicles is harmless and diverting fare for its primary audience older children and younger teenagers. Emotional conflict is kept to a necessary minimum and no scene is allowed to drag on too long. Excesses of cruelty and gore are avoided. Even the climactic home invasion is promptly dispatched with after the requisite furniture bashing and vigorous displays of cut and thrust. (Mallory is an amateur fencer.)But theres a perfunctory quality to the narrative a sense that all the bases - hairbreadth escapes cute and benign supernatural creatures adult skepticism dramatically dispelled - are being touched. The Spiderwick Chronicles exemplifies a problem with many of todays fantasy-adventure movies the sense that narrative values such as the artful building of suspense can be slighted because the computer-generated special effects are so good. We dont have to engage with the humans because the goblins are state of the art.

(AP Photo/ Paramount Pictures) NYET101 Opening todayMovie review ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" with Freddie Highmore Sarah Bolger Mary-Louise Parker Nick Nolte Joan Plowright David Strathairn. Directed by Mark Waters from a screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick David Berenbaum and John Sayles based on the series of books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black. 97 minutes. Rated PG for scary creature action and violence peril and some thematic elements. Several theaters. Also opening in IMAX at Pacific Science Centers Boeing IMAX Theater. ""That scared me to death"" said my 8-year-old companion on the way home from ""The Spiderwick Chronicles."" Parents note She said it with a big smile. Based on the series of books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black (reminiscent of the Lemony Snicket series but more supernatural and less witty) Mark Waters ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" depicts the adventures of a trio of siblings who move with their mother (Mary-Louise Parker nicely exasperated) into a crumbling Victorian house owned by their great-aunt Lucinda. Identical 9-year-old twins Jared and Simon Grace (both played by Freddie Highmore) and their 13-year-old sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger) discover there a dusty volume titled ""Arthur Spiderwicks Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You"" written by their great-great-uncle. It turns out to be a portal to the many mysterious creatures lurking in and around their new home -- many of whom are up to no good. Soon the kids are getting rhymed warnings from the house brownie Thimbletack (a computer-generated creature whos voiced by Martin Short and looks like a cranky Keebler Elf) which leads to threats and torture from a team of chunky goblins. (The goblins can be seen only through a magic stone or in a touch of grossness much enjoyed by the kids at the screening by having a hobgoblin spit in ones eye). And then theres a truly evil ogre played by Nick Nolte whos scary in the deranged way that only Nick Nolte can be. Kids who loved the books might well have some issues with the screenplay adaptation (credited to three writers) which trims the series five volumes down to 97 minutes and makes some significant changes to the action. Much of this seems to stem from the decision to have Highmore play both twins thus necessitating a minimum of scenes in which the boys are seen together. A British child actor previously seen (and quite moving) in ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" Highmore struggles a bit with the challenges of the double role; he cant quite find the right American accent nor can he make the two boys distinct. Bolger (""In America"") is more at ease; Mallory a fencing enthusiast has a charming swagger and a nicely maternal protectiveness for her brothers that overcomes her perpetual big-sister irritation. The special effects are elegantly done (those goblins swarming around the house like giant flies are genuinely creepy) with the occasional touch of real beauty. Great-Aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright) has a scene in which shes attended by a wealth of flower fairies delicate little sprites floating in the air rendered in delicious spring colors. As kids movies go this is no ""Harry Potter"" but its an enjoyable enough adventure -- with just enough scariness.

Starring Freddie Highmore Mary-Louise Parker Joan Plowright David Strathairn Martin Short. Directed by Mark Waters. (PG. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" may not be the most sophisticated of the post-""Harry Potter"" films but that may be one of its many considerable strengths. The film is graced with a mostly superb cast superior special effects a sparkling musical score by James Horner and a fantasy-filled plot with a bit of moralizing but fortunately only a bit. Based on the popular childrens books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black the screenplay (by Karey Kirkpatrick David Berenbaum and John Sayles) follows the four members of the Grace family minus Dad as they move into an ancient home that once belonged to their great-great-uncle Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) and most recently belonged to his daughter Lucinda (Joan Plowright). Lucinda has been carted off to a sanitarium but not before putting salt on all the windowsills and stocking the pantry with multiple jars of tomato sauce and honey. Mom Helen (an annoyingly mannered Mary-Louise Parker) daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger) and twin sons Jared and Simon (both played by Freddie Highmore) are not the most functional remnants of a family youll ever see. Helen is clearly distracted by something and unwilling to talk about whats going on with the kids dad. Mallory is a kind of Central Casting older sister - bossy intolerant of her brothers especially Jared and for good measure carries around her own fencing foil. Simon is withdrawn even when hes not keeping the world at bay by plugging earbuds into his ears. And Jared is a defiant troublemaker acting out and most of all waiting for his dad to show up in his life again. Director Mark Waters wastes little time with unnecessary setup. In fact he wastes little time anywhere in the film which is one of the reasons it is so much fun. Within minutes of arriving in their new home Jared unearths a secret book ""Arthur Spiderwicks Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You"" and ignores the warning note pinned to its cover. Years before Spiderwick had spent his entire life finding all kinds of supposedly mythical critters. Many such as the bird-eating hobgoblin Hogsqueal (voiced by Seth Rogen) and the little gremlin Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) who looks like a pint-size Mel Brooks and guards the book were friendly. Others including the slavering froglike goblins who attend the evil shape-shifting ogre Mulgarath (Nick Nolte) are out for blood literally If Mulgarath can get his hands on Uncle Arthurs book his power will know no limits and his goblin minions are charged with making his evil dreams come true. The plot turns on the kids and later Mom and Aunt Lucinda defending the old homestead and the precious book against Mulgarath and his horde. The special effects - by Industrial Light amp; Magic and Berkeleys Tippett Studio - are magical throughout from the hyperrealistic creepiness of the evil goblins to the flying griffin that transports the three kids to another dimention to the dazzling starlike sylphs who flutter around Uncle Arthur. That said what really capture our interest are the human stories of the Grace family. The screenwriters have worked hard not only to create believable characters but also to give them lines that real people would say. And realism amid all this glorious fantasy is exactly what Waters has aimed for in directing his cast. Highmore who was so impressive in ""Finding Neverland"" is twice as good here because as he plays both twins he gives each a distinctive personality. There are a few scenes early on that needed a bit more technical help One Highmore seems to be focused on something a few inches away from the other Highmore hes supposed to be talking to. But Highmore himself is perfectly focused no matter which twin hes playing. Very quickly youll find yourself believing they are two separate boys. Veterans Plowright and Strathairn are equally fine although like all the adult roles their screen time is relatively brief. Strathairn brings a compelling sense of mystery and longing to the role of Arthur Spiderwick. Only Mary-Louise Parker seems out of step with the film for most of the way. You could chalk it up to the notion that her character is distracted by the problems in her marriage but while shes one of our very best actresses most of the time here she seems to be playing Nancy Botwin in Showtimes ""Weeds"" without the marijuana. By the end of the movie authenticity breaks through just in time. Unlike so many other Potter-esque films ""Spiderwick"" doesnt aim for complex messages phony philosophizing or trumped-up universal truths. Instead it wants us to have a good time above and beyond everything. Thats a wish youll be happy to fulfill. -- Advisory The film contains some scary computerized creatures and situations that arent suitable for very young kids.

Last weekend she inhaled the movie like a tub of empowerment-buttered popcorn. Was it the sight of bickering siblings distracted mom haunted house enchanted backyard and shape-shifting creatures that bewitched her? Or was it that the fighting sibs twin boys (Freddie Highmore as both defiant Jared and nerdy Simon) and their older sis Mallory (Sarah Bolger) stand together against a destructive force? Or was it watching a movie where three teens find that the one thing theyre each good at proves useful both in the real and fantasy realms? While Coras mom didnt love love love the movie (too many CGI trolls and goblins not enough human character exposition) she very much enjoyed the story about the power of observation and of reading. Spiderwick opens with Mrs. Grace (Mary-Louise Parker) and her troubled brood driving to her familys ancestral home in Upstate New York. Since Mrs. Grace is separated from Mr. Grace seething Jared has seceded from the family. He wants to be with his dad not his short-tempered mother or his bossy sister or his brainiac brother. On their first night at the ramshackle Victorian built by their great-great-uncle naturalist Arthur Spiderwick and left to them by his dotty daughter Lucinda the Graces are spooked. The windowsills are blanketed with salt and the larder overstocked with tomato sauce and honey. That skittering noise you hear suggests a very large critter rattling around inside the walls. Unable to sleep Jared rummages in the attic and discovers sealed a field guide to the ""faerie world"" compiled by Arthur. When Jared breaks the seal to read it all heck breaks loose. Highmore (Finding Neverland August Rush) is scary-great. The young English actor (hes 16 today) creates two entirely different characters for Jared and Simon and is enormously watchable. As Mallory Bolger (In America) is as spirited as she is lovely vigilantly defending the Spiderwick estate from intruders while she defends her mother from Jareds outbursts. Coras mom likes Spiderwicks message more than she liked the effects-laden movie itself. The film underscores the power of reading and applying what we read to problem-solving. The story suggests that we dont really see the natural world around us and if we did our lives like Jareds and his siblings would be immeasurably richer.

Mary-Louise Parker plays a mom who splits with her husband in New York and is forced to move with her three kids to a cheaper house in the suburbs. Distant suburbs. Like maybe Transylvania. Their dilapidated new residence makes the house in ""Psycho"" look like Buckingham Palace. As mom and kids (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" star Freddie Highmore plays twins) settle in they notice weird stuff such as a pantry stocked with hundreds of containers of honey saltines and tomato sauce. Also there are creatures coming literally out of the woodwork. Highmore No. 1 called Jared has a hot temper; his more cerebral counterpart Simon is like bookworms near and far an avowed pacifist who never met a foe he didnt run away from. His big sister is handy with a sword but the movie spends more effort setting up the idea that shes a fencer than it does showing off her skills when it counts. Jared discovers a mysterious book about magical invisible creatures armies of whom are massing outside the house threatening to break in tear apart the children and possibly even devour the saltines. The goblins who look like the Budweiser frogs after about a dozen kamikazes are after the book. Simons solution ""Give it to them"" To the movies credit it not only makes Simon look like a chump but also gives us a scene that defines the word ""appease."" The goblins are frightening (though one inexplicably wears a blue naval officers coat and maritime headgear like a warty Capn Crunch) but their boss is even worse. Hes an ogre (voiced by Nick Nolte) with massive crooked teeth and rhino horns which adds up to an effect roughly one-third as scary as Noltes DUI mug shot. There is plenty of visual appeal for little kids but the plot wanders into a detour when Jared risks everything to visit a mysterious crazy great aunt. A phone call probably would have been a better idea. The characters lack shadings - Noltes ogre is loud but uninteresting - and the tone of the fantasy world isnt witty like Harry Potters or satirical like Lemony Snickets. Its all just silly featuring a tomato-sauce bomb and a whirling cloud of cosmic dandruff that picks people up and wafts them away.

Fantasy-adventure about children who discover a magical and dangerous world. With Freddie Highmore Mary-Louise Parker. Director Mark Waters (137). PG Violence scares. At area theaters. With Harry Potter MIA until November and no chance to revisit Narnia before May ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" should pass as a suitable substitute for young adventurers (and the grownups who love them).Though its missing the old-fashioned appeal of the best-selling books from Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi Mark Waters energetic adaptation does have its own charms. One - or more accurately two - of those come in the form of Freddie Highmore who plays twins Jared and Simon Grace. Along with their sister (Sarah Bolger) and mother (Mary-Louise Parker) the boys have just moved from New York to New England. Unlike the calmer Simon Jared is still smarting from his parents divorce and furious about getting stuck in a creepy old house in the middle of nowhere. With nothing better to do he starts exploring and discovers a dusty book covered by a dire note forbidding him to read it. Naturally he opens it immediately. The book written by Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) recounts the secrets of the faeries and other magical creatures living in the woods around the house. Though Jared and his siblings dismiss the work as fantasy they soon meet a brownie (voiced by Martin Short) and hobgoblin (Seth Rogen) who warn them of its terrible power. And it becomes increasingly clear that the forests shrewd ogre (Nick Nolte) will stop at nothing to own it. Waters keeps the pace moving and the suspense high. But ""Spiderwick"" is a world designed for children and most of the grownups involved dont quite understand it - on or offscreen. Of all the adult actors only Joan Plowright as the kids sympathetic aunt captures the right mood. More notably many of the evocative black-and-white drawings of the book have been replaced with computer animation that feels jarringly out of place. (And be warned The hideous monsters will terrify young viewers.) Happily Highmore has no trouble grasping the task at hand. As both the thoughtful Simon and the brash Jared he transports himself into this literal faerie tale with such convincing enthusiasm he turns us into believers too.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint When dads are away hobgoblins will play. That in somewhat condensed form is the theme of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" a kids fantasy adventure that links the absence of male role models to the appearance of nasty family-threatening imps bratty ogres and resentful misbehavior among latchkey children. On second thought maybe thats not so farfetched after all. The film stars the capable young actor Freddie Highmore twice as Jared and Simon Grace identical in appearance but opposite in behavior. They along with older sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger) and their stressed-out mom (Mary-Louise Parker) relocate to the abandoned boondocks mansion of their great-uncle after Dads departure leaves them unable to continue living in New York. The long-vanished uncle Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) an eccentric naturalist fit the family pattern of unreliable fathering. He spent his days in an attic full of spooky taxidermied oddities neglecting his only child Lucinda eventually disappearing without a trace. Lucinda (played as an adult by Joan Plowright) explained to investigators that dandelion-fluff pixies carried Father away; the authorities promptly carried her to the loony bin. Jared discovers the truth when he locates Arthurs notebooks a field guide to mystical beasties invisible to mortal eyes. With the aid of a magical monocle Jared observes this wild kingdom of chimeras plotting to invade the mansion and seize the book that contains their secrets. He unravels the plan with help from Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) an excitable house elf and Hogsqueal (Seth Rogen) a gruff hobgoblin. Unfortunately Jareds a troublemaker with no credibility. If his goody-goody twin Simon wont believe him who will? The story evolves into a scary-but-safe siege of the house sour-tempered mini-monsters being held at bay by kids hurling baggies of tomato sauce (which causes severe heartburn in trolls). While this supernatural ""Home Alone"" scenario is trite the story generates surprising emotional power with its portrayal of feckless or menacing father figures. Arthur Spiderwick through his butterfly-chasing heedlessness opens a Pandoras Box of trouble while literally winding up with his head in the clouds. The villain is Mulgrath a fearsome shape-shifter played by Nick Nolte who serves as a spookhouse reflection of the kids absentee father. The anger that is a familiar response of children injured in divorce wars is acted out here in terms that mental-health professionals would find telling Jared lashes out against Mulgrath in an attack of appalling intensity. Director Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"" ""Freaky Friday"") and scripters John Sayles Karey Kirkpatrick and David Berenbaum know that when it comes to scaring todays kids the Brothers Grimm have nothing on Dr. Freud. THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES  1/2 out of 4 stars The setup Relocating to their great-uncles spooky mansion three children discover an ecosystem of invisible fairies gremlins and trolls. What works Freddie Highmore is very good as a pair of lookalike/act-differently twins. What doesnt The films view of divorcing fathers is harsh. Great line Tow-truck driver (having just flattened an invisible goblin) ""Did I hit somebody?"" Kid ""Yes. Thank you"" Rating PG for scary creature action and violence peril and some thematic elements.

Red Cap (center) and his goblins do Mulgaraths dirty work for him in The Spiderwick Chronicles. Photo Paramount The Spiderwick Chronicles 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Coming on the heels of Harry Potter The Spiderwick Chronicles cant help but look derivative Troubled child uncovers a charmed world and fends off the powers of evil soaring over glade and glen on the back of a mythical beaked creature. J. K. Rowling used a hippogriff; here its simply a griffin. But Rowling has no monopoly on invisible magic or fatherless boys and there is room - now as always - for stories that peer through the veil into the unseen world of fairies. The best modern take in my book was Charles Sturridges overlooked understated Fairy Tale A True Story (1997) which treated its subject with the discretion and awe that it deserves. As Shakespeare knew better than anyone midsummer (or early fall) magic isnt for sissies. Nor is it in The Spiderwick Chronicles adapted by director Mark Waters (Just Like Heaven Mean Girls) and a trio of screenwriters (including indie-auteur John Sayles) from Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Blacks lovingly illustrated sparingly written fantasy series about the three Grace children and their spooky new home. Angry twin Jared; placid twin Simon (both of them played by the ever-more-Americanized Freddie Highmore thanks to another kind of witchcraft); their big sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger); and their frazzled-but-decent mom (Mary-Louise Parker) have barely moved into Crazy Aunt Lucindas rotting Victorian manse when Jared hears squirrelly noises behind the walls. The noises prove to be a vengeful ``boggart who once placated with crackers and honey turns into rat-size foppish ``brownie known as Thimbletack (the voice of Martin Short). For the last 80 years Thimbletack has protected a field guide to magical creatures assembled by the Grace kids Great Uncle Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) who unlocked every secret before a silken cloud of fairies whisked him away forever. To understand why they would do such a thing check out Nick Noltes eyeballs yellow snakelike spoiling for a fight. Nolte is the voice and (briefly) the form of Mulgarath a shape-shifting ogre who wants to get his paws on the field guide With such knowledge he could destroy all of fairyland and rule the mortal realm. Mulgarath who turns into a horned incubus when especially peeved has at his command a band of toady goblins just itching to breach the defensive toadstools surrounding the Graces home. Like everything else in this magical dimension the goblins cant be seen by human eyes without an enchanted monocle - or the porcine spit of Hogsqueal (voiced by Seth Rogen good one) a corpulent nostrily hobgoblin who provides key assistance. I wont reveal much else for the sake of anyone any parent or friend or hanger-on who isnt already acquainted with this fanciful and honestly touching plot. Sibling-directed zingers and other peppy humor lighten the tale but its the thread of childhood longing - for absent parents freedom from pain and simple understanding - that holds it all together. So sure maybe The Spiderwick Chronicles covers familiar ground on its jaunt through the magic forest. Maybe it puts a wicked spin on the power of words. (``This book has brought nothing but heartache and misery. Huh.) But it has plentiful whimsy a big enough heart and Joan Plowright in one fine scene burbling magnificently. It treats its archetypes with all due seriousness Good must engage evil in a final stand. And fatherless children must try to save the world. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Mainstays No Tools 6-Cube Storage Shelf for 20 + pickup at...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In a wooded area a barrier rings a gothic house once inhabited by a naturalist who discovered unnatural realms. The enchanted circle protects the house and more vital ""Arthur Spiderwicks Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You"" from an ogre who wants its secrets. ""Will that circle of toadstools be unbroken?"" might sum up a worry in ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" based on Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Blacks childrens books about the beguiling and menacing realms seen and unseen. ""By and by"" is the answer as Jared Grace (Freddie Highmore) twin Simon and teen sis Mallory join forces with a magical being named Thimbletack and nattering pig-snouted hobgoblin Hogsqueal to keep the book from Mulgarath and his toady minions. But before plaster walls cave floorboards buckle and the kids use household brews for combat the siblings have more personal battles. When the Graces moved into the house of uncle Arthur (David Strathairn) and more recently his daughter Lucinda Helen (Mary-Louise Parker) and the kids arrived without husband and father. While Mallory knows the deal Helen protects Jareds image of his father. Directed by Mark Waters ""Spiderwick"" combines the magic effects of more robust fantasy franchises with the story of a family under divorce duress without going too dark. In an elegant touch flashbacks of Spiderwicks investigations unfold in warm sepia. And Joan Plowright provides a tender dimension as Lucinda the daughter institutionalized for blaming fairies for her fathers disappearance. Also helping keep things merrily off-kilter Martin Short provides the cantankerous voice of Thimbletack charged by Arthur Spiderwick with protecting the book. Seth Rogen (""Knocked Up"") puts the id in idiot as Hogsqueal. Set on retribution the hobgoblin loses sight of his goal each time a bird flutters by. Seemingly useless his saliva enables Jared and his siblings to see the dangerous hoards nearing. Heres spit in your eye indeed. An engaging young actor Highmore is most convincing as quieter twin Simon (""I dont do conflict."") But its angry Jared who must grow. Nick Nolte makes an all- too-brief appearance as the human manifestation of Mulgarath. But then with his long white hair his unkempt beard and gravel voice hes frightening without monster makeup. ""Spiderwick"" is modest not epic. Its got thrills but is not allegorically deep or daunting like the Harry Potter or Narnia flicks. It skews young. The pre-tween sitting nearby at a preview seemed enthralled and then scared enough to sidle up to mom. Adults only mildly engaged by the hectic action can find in Mary-Louise Parkers role an amusing counter-realm. Is this what life would have been like if her ""Weeds"" persona had embraced downscale instead of making ends meet dealing dope in Agrestic Calif.?

Theres an ogre a bunch of goblins a whole lot of fairies and a house brownie who turns green when angry. These are the nonhuman denizens of a suitably rambling isolated storybook house that has passed down the family from Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) to a soon-to-be-divorced mom (Mary-Louise Parker) with the telegraphic last name of Grace her teen daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger) and younger twins Jared (the angrier adventurous one) and Simon (the milder prissier one; both are played by Freddie Highmore). To be honest the magical population is kind of dull -- average fantasy creatures (some voiced by Martin Short Seth Rogen and Nick Nolte) conjured with standard CGI wizardry in a fancy-grade adaptation from popular childrens books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black. Theyre kind of imitative too -- doesnt The Hulk hold the copyright on the green-with-rage issue? But critters arent really what the movie is about -- otherwise why bring in Mark Waters to direct? After Mean Girls and Freaky Friday Waters has become a specialist in lively dramas built on family tensions and kid-on-kid turf tussling. And his production is most alive when it ignores the gremlin contingent and goes for the real horrors which are (1) Mom and Dad are getting divorced; and (2) Mom doesnt believe her kids when they tell her of the troubles theyve seen. (Parker is a pro at embodying female distractibility.) Spiderwick is set in the present but goes for an overall design look of dainty cozy William Morris-y arts-andcraftiness. After Finding Neverland that tinge of nostalgia has become a Freddie Highmore thespian specialty. Yet the actor now 16 is never more affecting than when he as Jared fumes with contemporary resentment about the gremlins that have split up his parents and forced him beyond the protective boundaries that once encircled his kid-size universe.

The staggering success of the books and the movies featuring the bespectacled wizard sent studios scurrying through the childrens and young-adult sections of bookstores and libraries trying to find the next blockbuster that translates successfully to the screen. And by ""successfully"" we of course mean ""becomes a license to print money."" The Spiderwick Chronicles is probably not it. Its a little too incomplete in its storytelling to make adults love it and far too scary for young children to enjoy. (The screening was not without tears.) That leaves Spiderwick on an island without a target audience. Which is kind of a shame - had the story been stronger or the CGI creatures toned down a bit it might have scored big with adults and children. Now watch it shatter box-office records (though I doubt it). The move begins with Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) in a terrible rush flipping through a book with drawings and it appears actual samples of all kinds of fantastical creatures - fairies ogres and the like. Something is wrong obviously and Spiderwick is clearly in peril. Next we are introduced to Spiderwicks heirs His grandniece Helen (Mary-Louise Parker) and her children Mallory (Sarah Bolger) Jared and Simon (both played by Freddie Highmore). Theyre moving into Spiderwicks home a grand old pile straight out of central casting though in rather a good way. It stands empty because Spiderwicks daughter (Joan Plowright) insisted that strange things happened there and was put away for her troubles. For some reason she has stocked up on honey salt and tomato sauce. Helen is there to start a new life with her family leaving a bad marriage behind - a decision Jared in particular has trouble dealing with. He has anger issues gets blamed for everything that goes wrong and hasnt fully dealt (or really dealt at all) with his parents situation. But soon things disappear; fingers are pointed at Jared. He finds an old book and despite warnings not to open it begins reading. Then things go really sideways. Beyond a few pranks Simon is kidnapped by goblins in service to Mulgrath an ogre played when he appears in human form by Nick Nolte which may or may not be typecasting. Whatever the case Jareds family members are in peril and he has to save them. Of course to do so the bad seed has to blossom into a courageous resourceful and loving young man. The standard route for your young-adult protagonist really. Nothing wrong with that and Highmore is quite good particularly when hes playing Jared (Simons a bit of a dweeb frankly). But the movie is scary. Mulgrath especially in his more monstrous forms is genuinely menacing. His minions have their freak-out moments as well. The movie imparts a real sense of danger which is great if youre Martin Scorsese making a gangster film or whatever. But The Spiderwick Chronicles while not without its virtues (including a genuinely sweet ending) goes too far on the frightening front especially for a young audience. Scary can be a good thing. Scaring away your audience cannot. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goody koontzarizonarepublic.com. Read his blog at goodyblog.azcentral.com.

"Spiderwick Chronicles The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; spiderwick-chronicles-the ) Spiderwick Chronicles The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Thus far the formula has worked almost flawlessly combine fantasy with a family friendly approach and the recent result has caused studio heads to smile. The Spiderwick Chronicles is the latest in what could be considered ""starter"" fantasy tales. The set of five books written by Tony DiTerrlizzi and Holly Black falls into the same category with respected offerings like C.S. Lewis The Chronicles of Narnia J.R.R. Tolkiens The Hobbit Lloyd Alexanders The Chronicles of Prydain and (of course) J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter and the Sorcerors/Philsophers Stone. Its no coincidence that all of these have been filmed in one way or another (The Chronicles of Prydain as Disneys animated The Black Cauldron and The Hobbit thus far as a Rankin-Bass cartoon). The Spiderwick Chronicles is arguably geared for a slightly younger crowd than the other stories but it stands up well to cinematic conversion. The finished product will enthrall the target audience without boring those who chaperone them to theaters. The Spiderwick Chronicles is in no sense of the word ""adult"" or ""mature"" so more sophisticated fantasy lovers may be a little disappointed by what it offers. There are some popular monsters - goblins hobgoblins trolls and an ogre - but they more resemble deformed reptiles than their Damp;D counterparts. (Oddly the goblins look similar to the Rankin-Bass interpretations of those creatures in The Hobbit.) There are no wizards but there are plenty of fairies and all fairies use magic. To humanize the characters theres a broken home with all the attendant bitterness that children feel for separating parents. Theres not much of a moral here though unless one considers it a lesson that when moving into an old house one should not rummage around in locked chests hidden away in normally inaccessible attics. After leaving her husband Helen Grace (Mary-Louise Parker) has taken her three children - Mallory (Sarah Bolger) and twins Jared and Simon (both Freddy Highmore) - and left New York City for a fresh start. Their destination the old Spiderwick Estate - a decrepit mansion Helen inherited from her dotty old aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright). The Spiderwick Estate has a secret however 80 years ago explorer Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) wrote a Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You and in doing so unleashed some terrible forces. Now an army of goblins led by the demonic ogre Mulgrath (Nick Nolte) is massing to take the book away from its place of protection and only the Grace children stand in the way of Mulgraths domination of this world and many others. In order to succeed in the upcoming battle they must locate the long-missing Arthur and convince their mother theyre not deluded. Unlike several other notable fantasy adaptations this one squeezes the entire five-book series into a single movie so were not left waiting and wondering how things will turn out. The task isnt as daunting as one might expect and the three screenwriters (one of whom is John Sayles) understand what can go and what has to stay. The Spiderwick Chronicles books are all short with large print and many illustrations. Cuts were necessary to reduce 500 pages into 90 minutes but the overall production is surprisingly faithful to its source material although the tacked-on happy epilogue which is not the same as the one that concludes Book 5 reeks of studio interference. Viewers like their reader counterparts deserve a little more credit. As has been true of a lot of movies lately the first half is stronger than the second one. Theres something magical about the fairy/monster world slowly being unveiled to Jared when the goblins are only nightmarish creatures glimpsed through a glass lens. Later we see them massing in all their glory. This results in a lot of running around. Much of The Spiderwick Chronicles latter sections are devoted to CGI-heavy chase sequences. This is fine as far as it goes and they are expertly directed by Mark Waters but they cant escape a generic feel. And did anyone else notice James Horners overt cannibalization of his score from Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan? Its always distracting to hear music from another movie out of context. Few reviews of The Spiderwick Chronicles are going to single out acting. For the most part thats sensible. Nick Nolte is hidden under layers of make-up (and later turned CGI). The kids are adequate but not memorable. And the voice work by Martin Short (as Thimbletack) and Seth Rogan (Hogaqueal) is unremarkable. However Mary-Louise Parker is sympathetic and credible as a woman who is trying to keep her family together even though she has reached the breaking point. Her son hates her for taking him away from his father and she wont crush his spirit by revealing the truth to him. Its a touching and entirely human performance - the kind of we rarely expect (or get) in films of this genre. The Spiderwick Chronicles books are recommended for ages 7 and up and that seems a reasonable range for the movies. There are some scary moments but theyre not that scary and the violence is muted by the ways in which it is shot and presented. The Spiderwick Chronicles is not great fantasy but its on more solid ground than The Golden Compass and will seem less baffling to some. Theres enough here to keep adults engaged which is an important component of any motion picture that wants to be known as ""family entertainment."" I would place The Spiderwick Chronicles comfortably in that category.

Without the 7-year-old next to me I probably wouldnt have a clue what its all about. I still dont. But the enthusiasm of the audience under 10 at the screening I attended was contagious. They sat rapt soundless and well-behaved like they were in church. They didnt even scream when a monstrous 10-foot frog called Mulgarth that looks like a junior Jabba the Hut turned into Nick Nolte. That was pretty scary if you ask me and I dont mean the frog. Apparently The Spiderwick Chronicles are beloved best-selling fantasy adventures that sit in the bookcases of imaginative children right next to their Harry Potter books. Condensed at considerable cost into one movie the story begins when an old man named Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn looking a bit like Hans Christian Anderson) puts the finishing touches on his lifes work a leather-bound tome of gothic tales that spills the secrets of creatures from another world. A fate worse than death awaits anyone who opens it. Suddenly the heavens open lightning strikes he is whisked away in a squall of fairy dust and his only daughter is dragged off to the nuthouse. The Spiderwick Chronicles remain under lock and key in a secluded old mansion in the woods guarded by a loyal ""Brownie"" named Thimbletack (the voice of Martin Short). Visible to humans only when he wants to be Thimbletacks sole purpose in life Protect that book against all intruders. Its a job Thimbletack does superbly for 80 years. The intruders are a family of New Yorkers who can no longer afford the rent. They include newly divorced Helen Grace (Mary-Louise Parker) a relative of the Spiderwicks; her daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger); and her 15-year-old twins Simon and Jared (both played by the dangerously too-adorable but always camera-ready Freddie Highmore Johnny Depps inspiration for Peter Pan in Finding Neverland). Strange things happen instantly. Theres salt on the windowsills. Enchanted critters live inside the walls. Hobgoblins threaten the septic followers of evil forces led by the villainous chameleonlike Mulgarth are working day and night to steal the sacred book and rule the universe. Fairies and humans alike are safe only as long as they stay inside the circle that surrounds the house. The only person who can help them is dotty Aunt Lucinda who has grown up to be the great Joan Plowright. No one is safe against the ogre who has only one goal--to become the most powerful monster in the universe. The charms potions and spells are all contained in that sacred book and now that little Freddie Highmore has read it the horrors that await him make for a brew of breathless entertainment as one crisis follows the next. Director Mark Waters distills maximum suspense from the antic plot twists aided by animation puppets and some pretty awesome computer magic. Anyone over 15 may feel gorged on a diet of buttercream frosting. Be forewarned Acid reflux is almost guaranteed. But the Lilliputians among us will get their moneys worth. For a story aimed at the moppet market The Spiderwick Chronicles is one that holds the interest without unbalancing the I.Q.

Spinning five short books into one sleek yarn ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a brisk fine-tuned adaptation of Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Blacks bestselling childrens series. Tale of three young siblings -- and the goblins fairies griffins and ogres they find lurking in their backyard -- is a work of both modest enchantment and enchanting modesty grounded in a classically Spielbergian realm where childlike wonderment crosses paths with the tough realities of young adulthood. With careful studio nurturing this engaging gratifyingly non-epic adventure should snag midrange B.O. after its Feb. 14 release benefiting from Imax playdates and lack of family-friendly competition. The disappointing recent performance of New Lines ""The Golden Compass"" may have cooled commercial expectations for fantasy blockbusters not adapted from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien or C.S. Lewis; like ""Compass"" Paramount/Nickelodeons latest effort shows a director previously known for light comedies -- here Mark Waters (""Just Like Heaven"" ""Mean Girls"" ""Freaky Friday"") -- taking risks on a broader more ambitious canvas. But though it arrives with less fanfare than ""Compass"" did ""Spiderwick"" is a superior movie in almost all respects less grandiose in scope but richer in emotion and humor and boasting visual effects appropriately scaled to the more intimate tenor of the production. Young Jared (Freddie Highmore) is none too pleased to be leaving New York moving into a rural Victorian manse with his newly divorced mom (Mary-Louise Parker good) hot-tempered older sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger) and mellower identical twin Simon (also Highmore). Both mischievous and temperamental Jared is immediately blamed for a series of pranks that turn out to be the handiwork of Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) a cute elf-like brownie who morphs when provoked into an angry boggart. Thimbletack is merely one of the supernatural denizens on the premises not all of them benign There are goblins afoot invisible henchmen of the wicked shape-shifting Mulgarath (Nick Nolte) whos bent on obtaining a mysterious book left behind by Jareds great-great-uncle Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn seen in sepia-toned flashbacks). The tome is a sort of scientific field guide to the various kinds of fairies -- who along with the entire human race would be in grave danger if such knowledge were to fall into Mulgaraths possession. Charged with safeguarding the book at all costs Jared must plunder its secrets in order to protect them. More pressingly he must get his siblings and increasingly exasperated mom to believe in the enchanted realm right outside their door -- which in a sense is precisely what the filmmakers must accomplish for the audience. They succeed with a sly offhand approach that never leaves reality entirely behind allowing the supernatural elements to manifest themselves gradually and imposing limitations on how that manifestation occurs. Though truncated from the books and festooned with fewer rhymes and riddles the script (by Karey Kirkpatrick David Berenbaum and John Sayles) carefully establishes a set of rules governing its magical realm at the outset and adheres to them both scrupulously and cleverly. Plot points such as the kids inability to see the goblins at first or the ""protective circle"" drawn around the house by Spiderwick years ago to keep out evil work to modulate suspense and emphasize the human characters vulnerability. And despite an abundance of comical CG creatures like Thimbletack and the friendly goblin Hogsqueal (voiced by Seth Rogen) -- whom viewers will probably like about as much as they like Dobby the house-elf in the ""Harry Potter"" pics -- the visual effects have a subtle rough-hewn quality in keeping with the moody autumnal reds and browns of Caleb Deschanels cinematography. Pic builds steadily in visual grandeur enveloping rather than bombarding the audience; late in the film the sight of a character engulfed in pixie dust delivers a gorgeous ethereal frisson. With dad conspicuously absent the script inevitably drifts into angry-kid/misunderstood-single-parent territory which though well played feels like a distraction from the material rather than a dramatic extension of it. Pic also at times overdoes the sibling warfare almost playing up Mallorys disbelief as a way to help auds suspend their own. But Waters never steers his actors wrong Highmore (""Finding Neverland"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") is winning as ever in a dual role and Bolgers feisty turn will impress anyone who saw her quietly heartbreaking debut in ""In America""; with their fine American accents the young thesps never once betray that theyre from across the Pond. Joan Plowright makes a brief welcome appearance as an elderly relative who holds secrets concerning the Spiderwick legacy. Kudos to production designer James Bissell and an army of art directors and set decorators for bringing the cobwebs and crannies of the ramshackle Spiderwick estate vividly to life. Pic was shot in a secluded glade in Montreal adding to the sense that the story is taking place at the blurred edges of two neighboring worlds; James Horners score at times plucking strings to eerie effect completes the illusion.
