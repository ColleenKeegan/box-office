The World Wrestling Entertainment superstar known as Kane (real moniker Glen Jacobs) is suitably humongous as a hulking psycho who decimates a group of over-age juvenile delinquents in a spectacularly decrepit hotel. Much like the pic itself however the grappler-turned-actor does little more than go through the motions. Even the most rabid gore hounds likely will wait for the DVD release. Throats are ripped heads are crushed and limbs are severed with brutal efficiency throughout ""See No Evil"" but thats not nearly enough to dispel the sense of deja vu that pervades this generic slasher thriller. The World Wrestling Entertainment superstar known as Kane (real moniker Glen Jacobs) is suitably humongous as a hulking psycho who decimates a group of over-age juvenile delinquents in a spectacularly decrepit hotel. Much like the pic itself however the grappler-turned-actor does little more than go through the motions. Even the most rabid gore hounds likely will wait for the DVD release. Helmer Gregory Dark flaunts his music-video background with some modestly inventive visuals particularly during the grisly prologue. Police officer Williams (Steven Vidler) loses his partner -- and much of his right arm -- while tangling with axe-wielding Jacob Goodnight (Kane) in the psychos suburban charnel house. Before he can be chopped to bits Williams shoots his assailant in the head. Unfortunately such gunplay rarely has lasting impact in a horror pic. Flash forward four years Williams is working with troubled teens (and judging from the characters in his charge troublesome twentysomethings) at a county detention center. With eight weekend-furloughed inmates along for the ride as a volunteer clean-up crew he arrives at the once-glitzy multi-storied Blackwell Hotel a long-abandoned ruin slated for re-opening as a homeless shelter. Trouble is the hotel already serves as a shelter for -- yes you guessed it -- Jacob Goodnight. And hes not of a mind to be hospitable. Jacob proves to be more grimly determined than genuinely terrifying as he wanders through the sprawling hallways in search of helpless (and preferably screaming) prey. Hooks chains and axes are his weapons of choice -- though in a pinch hell improvise with an elevator door or his bare hands -- and he usually caps off his carnage by plucking eyeballs from recently deceased (or not-quite-dead) victims. To motivate the latter quirk scripter Dan Madigan relies on flashbacks to childhood abuse and religious fanaticism. Its pretty hokey stuff to be sure. But in a pic this routine it passes for novelty. As Williams Steve Vidler sounds distractingly raspy as though hes trying to indicate that the maimed cop really shouldnt be spending so much time in a dusty cobwebby building. (Interiors actually were shot at Australias Movie World Studios.) Kane has impressive screen presence which is all his role requires while the attractive young supporting players struggle mightily to flesh out their thinly written characters. Standouts include Samantha Noble as a sullen punkette with a fortuitous tattoo and Penny McNamee as an animal rights activist whose exit scene is gravely ironic and undeniably funny. Although much blood is spilled and splattered precious little suspense is generated during ""See No Evil."" To their credit however production designer Michael Rumpf and lenser Ben Nott somehow manage to make the pic look if not feel scary.

Comments See No Evil Juvenile offenders cleaning up a trashed art deco hotel are stalked by a bald psycho (wrestler Glen Jacobs) in this routine slasher. Part of a coed work-release program the kids are lodged at the hotel and immediately pair off for sex which proves the juvenile justice system isnt as bad as some people say. The gilt-and-grime setting is eerily atmospheric and screenwriter Dan Madigan has a nicely sick sense of humor (one kid doing time for animal activism is hung upside down and eaten by hungry dogs).

"Gory See No Evil is generic but proficient horror junk - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Gory See No Evil is generic but proficient horror junk By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  May 20 2006 A horror movie starring a professional wrestler and directed by a guy who used to make hard-core porn? Some audiences will consider that a warning and others a recommendation. The former have probably already stopped reading. The latter will be cheered to hear that See No Evil"" could be worse.Which is not to say its good or even remotely original. A dank gory thriller about a handful of juvenile inmates picked off by a hulking killer while cleaning a boarded-up hotel See No Evil"" is generic teen dice-and-slice with interior design by way of Saw."" The movies tight and reasonably well shot though and there are flashes of nasty invention between the ritual guttings.After a pro forma opening scene that establishes Jacob Goodnight (Glen Jacobs better known to WWE fans as Kane) as an ax murderer extraordinaire with a penchant for plucking out the eyes of his victims we flash forward to the desiccated Blackwell Hotel where a busload of County Correctional detainees are being offloaded for a weekend work program. Theyre a coed group and the women are dressed scantily -- how convenientThe police officer (Steven Vidler) overseeing the crew was a survivor of Jacobs previous rampage but hes helpless to stop his charges from fanning out through the ruined building and indulging in drugs sex and other deranged-killer magnets. Miasmic lighting secret passageways and a tinny score that seems dropped in from one of director Gregory Darks sex films add to the eldritch kitsch. At least the producers were able to pay for a fly wrangler and a lot of rubber eyeballs.Who will live? Spoiled rich shoplifter Zoe (Rachael Taylor)? Computer hacker Richie (Craig Horner)? Psycho drug dealer Michael (Luke Pegler) or his regretful ex-girlfriend Kira (Samantha Noble)? Crunchy Melissa (Penny McNamee)? Abuse survivor Christine (Christina Vidal)? Other questions loom Is there a motivation for Kira to take a shower other than contractual stipulation? And who lights all the candles in these movies?See No Evil"" is proficient junk which makes it something of an improvement over recent horrors like An American Haunting."" Dark has been working on and off the fringes of the respectable film industry for years and he knows how to keep one of these things moving; he also understands that horror movies need money shots too and he provides them with trash panache.Kanes not much of an actor -- hes not even that scary with the lights turned on -- but he comes across like Andre the Giants little brother and darned if you dont feel sorry for the big lug by the end. So many annoying teenagers to kill so little time.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Starring Kane Christina Vidal and Michael Pagan. Directed by Gregory Dark. (R. 84 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""See No Evil"" is a horror movie that doesnt just show a woman with her eyeballs ripped out it has a camera zoom into one of the sockets. If youre the type of person who loves seeing people get their eyes gouged in graphic fashion  then run -- dont walk -- to this film. Seriously this is your ""Citizen Kane."" But the extreme levels of gratuitous gore also make the picture -- which was not screened for critics -- difficult to recommend. Consenting adults who know what theyre getting into will have a better-than-average time at ""See No Evil."" People who dont might end up spending 20000 on therapy in hopes of making the nightmares go away. The latest movie produced by World Wrestling Entertainment capo Vince McMahon follows the time-tested template of the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" films. In this version eight small-time young adult criminals are sent to a spooky hotel where they can knock a month off their sentences if they spend three days cleaning. But three hours dont pass before the convicts and their corrections officer chaperones start getting picked off. ""See No Evil"" isnt ""Silence of the Lambs"" but it does have some marginally clever moments. ""WWE Smackdown"" writer Dan Madigan handles the script and its clear he can do more than write bad lines about smelling what the Rock is cooking. The reeking dilapidated hotel has some interesting surprises and the victims each have a memorably unique scene of death and torture. The dog-loving hippie chick suffers a particularly ironic beat down. Because McMahon is an ace businessman he maximizes his cross-promotion possibilities by casting Kane in the serial killer role. The hulking wrestler could be the next Laurence Olivier but well have to wait until his next movie to find out. He says only three words in the entirety of ""See No Evil"" and rarely opens his mouth at all. Former porn director Gregory Dark (his previous efforts include ""New Wave Hookers 4"" and ""Let Me Tell Ya Bout Black Chicks"") favors two shots of the actor -- either extreme close-ups that render thespian abilities irrelevant or footage of him swinging a hook at the end of a chain or an ax. Kane does both with great skill. Unfortunately the other actors do open their mouths and most of the dialogue ranges from cliche to laughable. If the whole idea of a coed work-release camp in a broken-down death trap of a hotel isnt intelligence-insulting enough at one point a cop actually says ""Shouldnt we wait for backup?"" Its also disconcerting that even though most of these actors arent very famous only one of the girls and none of the guys take their clothes off. I think the silent majority will agree If youre going to pay 10 for a lowbrow horror movie filled with D-listers they should at least get naked. Once again this is a film thats really hard to grade. Depending on your fetishes it might be the best or worst movie you see this summer. So well split the baby (one of the few acts of violence not featured in this film) and give ""See No Evil"" a Little Man Sitting Intently(tm) -- even though no one in the audience could possibly be doing that during this movie. Clutching a partners forearm with glee or storming out in disgust are both possibilities but sitting intently isnt an option. -- Advisory This film contains profanity brief nudity violence and unprecedented amounts of ophthalmologic gore. If youre not emotionally ready to see a dog urinate in a dead guys eye socket then maybe ""An American Haunting"" is more your speed.
