Comments X2 Marvels durable sci-fi comic about a league of teenage mutants with wild superpowers yields another warm-weather action flick though the light tone and modest character development of X-Men have given way to an avalanche of digital effects and a bloated symphonic score. The screenplay by a five-man committee that included director Bryan Singer gives more time to the mutant communitys various powers. The demonstrations of the latter are well rendered and often quite funny but they push this into the realm of the Saturday-matinee serial whenever peril looms some misfit kids freak abilities are just the ticket to dispel it. As in the first movie Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are trotted out periodically to add a little gravitas. 124 min. By J.R.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Like the first Tim Burton-directed Batman movie the original X-Men was the rare comic-book adaptation that satisfied the needs of both summer-movie audiences and all but the most Mylar-addled comic-book fans. Directed with depth efficiency and wit by Bryan Singer the film suffered only from a tendency to seem like a setup for an even bigger movie. And here it is. Significantly longer and stuffed with new mutants unresolved old business new subplots and many more fights X2 X-Men United suggests that Singers gaggle of screenwriters received script notes reading ""More more more."" Fortunately bigger usually equals better here and when it doesnt it equals just as good. The film opens with the kind of breathless setpiece most action movies would save for a climax an assassination attempt on the U.S. president by teleporting mutant Nightcrawler (a well-cast Alan Cumming who finds the right balance of scariness and helplessness). What looks like a terrorist act is eventually revealed as a broader conspiracy to crack down on mutant freedoms a plot spearheaded by hateful general Brian Cox who uses the attack as an excuse to go after the residents of the school run by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). With their expansive casts tangled plotlines and overheated passions the X-Men comic books have always been as much about soap operatics as laser beams. So far the film series has not just understood that notion but run with it. Singer sandwiches melodrama within eye-catching comics-inspired compositions allows time for characters to interact with (and often annoy) one another and whenever the situation gets too grim lets Hugh Jackmans anti-heroic Wolverine or some other witty business deflate any pretensions. Aside from a couple of duds in the ensemble the film also benefits from its gifted cast with Ian McKellen once again standing out as Magneto the pitiless radical mutant whose escape from prison leads to the uneasy alliance suggested by the films subtitle. With all the talk of government crackdowns in the name of national security-the president even shares George W. Bushs habit of wearing an American-flag pin lest anyone question his patriotism-the story also boasts a muted contemporary resonance. Only in the finale do the special effects start to overwhelm the plot and characters but by that point the film has long since begun to coast on its own momentum toward the inevitable and welcome setup for the presumably even bigger X3.

"At the Movies X2 X-Men United 050203 - The Augusta Chronicle Augusta Chronicle   | CC News Times   | Augusta.com   | Augusta Real Estate   | Augusta Autos   | Augusta Jobs   | Apartment Finder Site Web At the Movies X2 X-Men United By David Germain| Associated Press Friday May 02 2003 ""X2 X-Men United"" is sure to satisfy most fans of the first ""X-Men"" movie including the zealous devotees of the comic books that spawned the flicks. With his new installment director Bryan Singer is able to leap in without the cumbersome character and situation setups needed for the initial film. So ""X2"" rips along at a faster pace pulsing with wilder action sequences and more dazzling visual effects. Comic fans miffed at the first movies exclusion of some favorite superhero mutants from the crowded ""X-Men"" pantheon will be happy to see a handful of fresh genetic freaks on hand for ""X2."" All that said the inherent goofiness of leather-clad adults with weird hairdos and skin pigmentation using their special powers to zap one another is somehow more pronounced this time. Maybe its the drastic geopolitical shifts since summer 2000 when ""X-Men"" came out - Sept. 11 conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq continued fears of terrorism worldwide. While the ""X-Men"" notions of tolerance vs. unreasoning hatred are more relevant than ever the silly superpowers dorky costumes and other pubescent trappings of ""X2"" trivialize those serious themes. In combination with that generally more commonplace villainy is afoot in the sequel than in the original. Ian McKellens Magneto who made for a richly conflicted bad guy in the first film is declawed for much of ""X2"" in which he becomes an unlikely ally for the benevolent mutants against a human foe. Brian Cox is the main antagonist in ""X2"" - William Stryker who heads a renegade military unit that assaults the school for young mutants run by Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) in a plot to rid the world of these genetic mutations. Rather than mutant Magnetos nuanced enmity toward humans Stryker is motivated by a rather shallow personal hatred of mutants. All the mutant heroes of the first movie suit up against Stryker Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) with super-healing abilities metal claws and a hair style somewhere between Elvis and Lon Chaney Jr.s Wolf Man; Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who like Xavier possesses telepathic and telekinetic powers; Storm (Halle Berry) able to whip up climatic disturbances on a whim; Cyclops (James Marsden) whose eyes blast deadly energy beams; and Rogue (Anna Paquin) a junior X-Person who can fatally swipe others life essences with a touch. Joining the veterans are Alan Cumming as the blue-skinned Nightcrawler an ex-circus freak able to teleport himself from place to place; Shawn Ashmore reprising his bit role in ""X-Men"" as teen mutant Iceman who can put the deep freeze on anything; and Aaron Stanford as Pyro who can control fire. A handful of other teen ""X-Men"" make cameos. Also back is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as cinemas hottest blue-tinted femme fatale Magnetos shape-shifting Gal Friday Mystique. Kelly Hu plays Deathstrike Strykers bad-girl flunky who possesses Wolverines healing powers and a variation on his retractable claws. With so many characters ""X2"" suffers from big fat ensemble-cast syndrome Perils and obstacles sometimes are awkwardly presented so the mutants various skills can be showcased. Performances are solid throughout with the actors managing to straight-face their way through some truly inane dialogue (""The last thing we need to see is the body of a mutant kid on the 6 oclock news"" the stern-faced president tells advisers). The first film intellectualized and moralized more about human bigotry whereas ""X2"" is the cinematic equivalent of a comic thin on the sociological conflict heavy on gunplay and hand-to-hand combat. Granted this is comic-book violence executed with superb skill by Singer and company. But theres still cause for uneasy reflection when an audience of peaceable people at a critics screening breaks into cheers and applause when Wolverine extends his claws to skewer the torso of a bad guy as though he were a cocktail wiener. ""X2 X-Men United"" a 20th Century Fox release is rated PG-13 for sci-fi-action violence some sexuality and brief language. Running time 134 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.

Hes a student at Professor Xaviers School for the Gifted -- the X-franchises version of Hogwarts in ""Harry Potter"" -- and his gift is the ability to manipulate fire although he cant create it. Pyro is the perfect poster boy for this sequel which is much more elaborate than the original and even less coherent. (Bryan Singer directed both films.) ""X2"" manipulates its Marvel comic-book characters -- and its audience -- with a relentlessness that may pass for intensity. Yet theres little zest less grace and particularly in the writing no creative spark to ignite the imagination. The closest ""X2"" comes to originality is in its shrewd development of a theme that served as the first films starting point -- the persecution of mutants in a world that feels threatened by their special gifts. Theyre anathema to the government whose fervor for stamping them out is fanned in an effective opening sequence by a terrorist attack that appears to be part of some mutant plot. Theyre also misunderstood by their parents. In one of the few scenes distinguished by sustained human content a mutant named Bobby comes out of the closet only to find that his mother is aghast. ""Have you tried... not being a mutant?"" she asks. (Bobby a.k.a. Iceman has a special gift for freezing things and a passion for Anna Paquins Rogue who has a special gift for draining energy from anyone she touches. The challenges of their budding sex life are noted but not explored.) Human content hasnt been and shouldnt be a hallmark of the comic-book world where figures are supposed to be bigger and bolder than life. But the dominant figures here are duller than life. Hugh Jackmans Wolverine has lost his sparkle if not his edge. (In one of the few moments that are touched with grace a pussycat licks Wolverines metal claws.) Halle Berrys Storm kicks up multiple tornadoes but she cant rouse herself from a frozen-faced trance. Though I admired Famke Janssen for taking a minimalist approach to the role of Jean Grey an X-woman confronted by a crucial choice Jeans fate left me with minimal feelings. And Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen two English actors with demonstrably special gifts return to parody themselves and maybe each other as Xavier and Magneto archenemies who enter into an alliance of convenience in a plot thats at first amusingly unfathomable then maddeningly so. This is written of course from an adult perspective. ""X2"" was made for kids a vast international audience of kids whove been searching the Web for any news of the films dramatis mutantes -- such one-trick ponies as Cyclops Mystique Deathstrike Colossus Kitty Pryde and the new blue Nightcrawler -- and who will happily buy the dim plot plus the videogames it spawns. All the same ""X2"" and recent action adventures like it constitute a mutation in their own right fast-paced slow-witted movies in which the impact is the message; impersonal movies that deny any need for characterization; disjointed movies that make no apologies -- and pay no penalties -- for making no sense. Their special gift is giving little and getting a lot. The Dancer Upstairs John Malkovich makes his debut as a feature director with ""The Dancer Upstairs"" which stars Javier Bardem and Laura Morante and was adapted by Nicholas Shakespeare from his own novel of the same name. Ambitious and uneven the film evokes often powerfully the murderous chaos that swept Peru in the 1980s when a corrupt repressive government battled Communist terrorists of the Shining Path movement. (It also suggests chillingly the current agonies of Colombia.) The title refers to the 1992 capture of Abimael Guzman the Shining Path leader in a room above a Lima ballet studio. In this fictional account Mr. Bardem plays Rejas a disillusioned lawyer turned police detective and Ms. Morante is Yolanda a ballet teacher whose students include Rejass young daughter. Part thriller and part romance ""The Dancer Upstairs"" puts the detective on a troubled path as his hunt for Ezequiel the movies counterpart of Guzman conflicts with his search for love. Over the past two decades Mr. Malkovich has become known as an actor and then a movie star of extraordinary intelligence. Its no surprise then that he has chosen as a director to make a serious film of uncommon complexity. ""The Dancer Upstairs"" shows things seldom seen on the feature screen the growth of a shadowy movement in an impoverished countryside; the life of a city shattered by terror; the struggles of an idealist in squalid times. Whats more his film which was shot by the excellent Spanish cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine conveys a sense of place and time with exciting immediacy. Where ""The Dancer Upstairs"" trips and sometimes falls is in the realm of more conventional drama. Rejas and Yolanda are lovers who for all their differences mirror one anothers deepest yearnings. Yet the succession of events that brings them together is by turns arbitrary illogical and unconvincing while the portrait of Rejass life at home with his materialistic wife is needlessly condescending. The drama is weakened further by a problem that flows from Mr. Malkovichs initial decision to make an English-language film with actors who speak English as a second language. Its less of a problem for Ms. Morante who has a smaller role. And Javier Bardem certainly pulled it off in ""Before Night Falls."" But this superb actor isnt at his best here. Nor is he helped by a sporadically sententious screenplay that puts Hemingwayesque phrases in the detectives mouth. For a reminder of how good his best can be -- and for an example of Mr. Malkovichs skill -- theres a wordless scene toward the end when Rejas watches his little daughter dance. Mr. Bardem makes us understand without speaking a syllable that Rejas is seeing Yolanda at the same time. Winged Migration ""Winged Migration"" redefines the notion of in-flight movies and of birds-eye views. A magnificent documentary that flies us along with migratory birds on their intercontinental travels its the polar opposite -- North Pole South Pole and all latitudes in between -- of modern feature films that rely on special effects. This ultramodern film photographed with special cameras from a variety of airborne platforms (gliders helicopters balloons and little remote-controlled drones) looks too good to be anything but fake. Yet every vivid frame of every shot is in every sense on the up-and-up; sometimes the cameras are actually inside the birds formations. That means were able to sense as never before what these ceaseless migrations represent not just the abstract beauty of formation flight but the staggering effort expended by individual birds wing-beat by wing-beat as they traverse vast distances. (The Arctic tern we are told flies 12500 miles from the Arctic to the Antarctic.) ""Winged Migration"" was produced and co-directed by Jacques Perrin a producer of the similarly astonishing ""Microcosmos"" which used miniature cameras and microphones to investigate insect life. (Where by the way is the DVD? Its been almost seven years since ""Microcosmos"" was released.) Like the earlier film this one is flawed by an intrusive score but thats a small price to pay for nature photography of almost revolutionary clarity. And birds on the wing arent the only attraction. ""Winged Migration"" also serves as a travelogue taking note of such attractions along the way as the Mont St. Michel the Great Wall of China the Statue of Liberty and Monument Valley as well as a steel mill where several weary birds alight then get trapped in a rivulet of sludge. Above all though this documentary celebrates a part of the planets life that usually goes unsung though not unseen great swarms of flapping creatures that sometimes coalesce into one undulating organism or single birds with wings outstretched navigating ancient passages across invisible seas.    VIDEO TIP The kids in ""Village of the Damned"" (1960) arent mutants strictly speaking or even loosely speaking; they come from Elsewhere. But theyre as creepy as theyre nasty in the original version of this now-classic thriller which was adapted from John Wyndhams novel ""The Midwich Cuckoos."" John Carpenters 1995 remake is nowhere near as good though it has the twin virtues of starring Christopher Reeve and being available on DVD.

By Anthony Lane The sequel to ""X-Men"" is entitled ""X2"" which cunningly suggests that we may be getting double the pleasure for our money. The first film which came out in 2000 concerned a team of ""mutants""--creatures who more often than not resemble human beings but each of whom possesses an unusual or protuberant talent. Why Warren Beatty was not asked to join the club I cannot fathom although some moviegoers would advance an even stronger claim for his sister the spirited Shirley MacLaine. Her psychic powers would slot in nicely beside those of Jean (Famke Janssen) who telepathically diverts air-to-air missiles; Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who sounds like a cut-price perfume and changes shape as the mood takes her; and Rogue (Anna Paquin) who can suck out all your energy with the merest touch of her hand. We had a word for that at school. All these dainty women return for the latest installment as does Halle Berry who reprises the role of Storm the climate-warper with the faintly distracted air of one who has an Oscar on her mantelpiece and better things to do. Also present are Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) the good genius who is confined to a wheelchair and Magneto (Ian McKellen) the naughty genius who was confined to a ""plastic prison"" at the end of the first film. This time they join forces to confront Colonel Stryker (Brian Cox) who combines mutantphobia with a career in Special Operations. (I cant help feeling sorry for Special Ops. The poor guys drop into Iraq secure the oil fields and live on lizards and stale water for six weeks and still Hollywood uses them as shorthand for the black arts.) Strykers plan unfolds first at a school for mutant children in New York State which he attacks by night and then in an underground bunker tucked behind a hydroelectric dam where he tries to make the planet safe for purebred humans. ""X2"" directed by Bryan Singer is a curious mixture. On the one hand the plot is tangled to the point of obscurity--willfully so if you never saw the original picture. Entanglement in itself is no sin; if anybody has confidence in the complex it must be Singer who reminded us with ""The Usual Suspects"" what a joy it is to be snarled in the narrative net. Here though there are simply too many characters to get a handle on and the sheer proliferation of special effects offers him a license so unfettered that most of the mutants act not according to their natures but purely on the ground of what at that juncture looks most groovy. When A can read Bs mind and B can turn into C and C can vanish in a puff of smoke the old logic of means and motive seems hopelessly antique yet nothing takes its place. If Jean has such a crush on Scott (James Marsden) for instance why do they meet in a force field of telekinetic flame? Whats wrong with a kiss? At the same time for all the scything violence of the effects there is something a little wet about ""X2."" Its liberal exhortations nudging us at regular intervals toward interspecies tolerance play so heavily on the nerves that the temptation to root for the villains is all but overwhelming. According to Kurt Wagner (Alan Cumming) the movies resident Nightcrawler ""Most people will not see anything beyond what they see with their own two eyes."" Well for goodness sake man you can hardly blame them. Wagner himself is a Bible-quoting devil with ridged skin yellow eyes lashing tail and a German accent as heavy as rusted iron whose opening gambit is to cause fear and mayhem in the Oval Office thereby intimidating the President himself. If I were Henry Kissinger I would call my lawyers. So what survives the devastation of this film? As in the first outing the answer is Hugh Jackman. He plays Wolverine who divides his days between hirsute solitude and bursts of decisive activity aided by garden shears that sprout from his hands at moments of high emotion. He gets to fight with his opposite number the boringly named Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) who is a kind of Edwina Scissorhands in a business suit and who in Singers loveliest image of fantastical poetry weeps tears of molten metal as she fades. One of Jackmans recent roles was that of Curly in the London production of ""Oklahoma"" but if it was a wrench to switch from a bright golden haze in the meadow to the bright silver blades on his knuckles he doesnt show it and he has carefully measured out the exact pinch of salt with which these comic-strip shenanigans need to be taken. The most winning sight in an overblown picture is the tiny tremor of amusement on Wolverines face as he hands a bottle of Dr. Pepper to his young sidekick Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) who chills it with a single breath. Cool. If that isnt an argument for allowing mutants to stay on earth I dont know what is. Long before the current waves of rage began to beat against the French one aspect of that great nation was an unfailing wellspring of caustic mirth. I refer of course to Johnny Hallyday whom the French have for decades regarded as their answer to Elvis. There may have been nothing to touch France in its food and wines in the range of its landscape and lingerie but at least it had the decency to be dreadful at something. French pop music was one of the most enduring of European fiascoes and even for the severest Francophile the success of M. Hallyday was hard to explain away. Moreover just to twist the knife he appeared to be eternal smiling bleakly from every issue of Paris-Match since the founding of the Fifth Republic. And now look what happens. He turns up in a movie and hes great. The film is ""Man on the Train"" and Johnny is that man. He plays Milan a lonesome figure who alights in a provincial town with nothing but a suitcase and a headache. Buying aspirin at a drugstore he meets an aging local a former teacher named Manesquier (Jean Rochefort) who offers him a glass of water and a place to stay. It is to the credit of the director Patrice Leconte that this turn of events feels neither peculiar nor creepy; both men are at a loose end and they duly shrug and settle into each others life. In short this is a study of friendship--the most widespread of human transactions far more common than love but treated by the movies with comparative disdain. We get heaps of children and teen-agers becoming friends on film but adults tend to be shovelled with indecent haste into enmity and lust. Is that why we are so heartened even as love is snapped off at the root by the final companionable line of ""Casablanca""? Whether the friendship is a beautiful one is hard to tell but it manages with singular grace to be at once grouchy and uncomplaining. Milan may teach Manesquier to drink brandy and to shoot a revolver but he also asks to borrow a pair of slippers. Better still he finds and lights a pipe thus confirming that the two men are trading places or at any rate watching their various penchants tilt and touch. Hallyday is wolfish weathered and sullen his eyes of a blue that could either be deadened or dangerous. As for the drooping Rochefort he is like an elderly artist who after a lifetimes practice can sketch his appointed character with the deftest of flicks. Of one undistinguished ancestor he remarks ""His regiment was not required at Austerlitz"" and you catch the rueful pride of the congenital nonachiever with his tendency ""to undermine the highlights of my life."" The problem is that movies rarely thrive on lowlights alone. It can be done but Leconte lacks the austerity to complete a film in which nothing much occurs. And so with some reluctance we are bustled toward a climax in which the guns that Milan secreted in a drawer are brought into service while Manesquier enters the hospital for an operation. The film splices their fates together but the neatness feels melodramatic. I prefer those quiet patches where Leconte relies on light alone to illuminate his heroes--steely dusks and dawns for the secretive Milan warmer tones of wood and leather for his autumnal pal. Above all I wish that I could have seen ""Man on the Train"" in its native land. Oh to have been part of a Parisian audience for that delectable moment when Johnny Hallyday is asked whether he plays any music. With a modest murmur and half a crinkled grin he replies ""I had a harmonica once."" Spoken like a rocker.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Despite the bow of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" soon after ""X2"" will stick around as a muscular performer. ""X2"" is actually an accurate title for the ""X-Men"" sequel as the new picture is about twice as good as the original although this will mean very different things to various constituencies. Hardcore fans and sci-fi/comix geeks who propelled the 2000 release to a then-surprising worldwide gross of 295 million will be thrilled by the big jump in special effects work and new plot developments while nonconverts and the just-curious will likely find the follow-up merely half as silly as the first edition. Long-incubating anticipation and public fascination with the Marvel Comics world that has only increased during the past three years will propel this 120 million-plus Fox franchise entry to a couple of awesome opening frames beginning May 2 that will be eclipsed two weeks later by ""The Matrix Reloaded."" But ""X2"" will stick around as a muscular performer for some time thereafter before being relaunched into high-altitude flight as a long-distance home-consumption title. From director Bryan Singer on through the principal crew and cast members ""X2"" sees most of the core team reunited for another turn at bat to generally improved results except for the running time which is a needless 30 minutes longer than the originals. New picture is bigger and more ambitious in every respect from its action and visceral qualities to its themes. What was implicit before concerning the prejudice against mutants has now been made the films overriding concern. While younger viewers may take this focus on bias as something close to profound more mature auds might tend to view the metaphor as more than a bit simplistic rendering clear the generational divide the film will undoubtedly encounter. ""Mutant Freedom Now"" reads a note that a would-be assassin leaves on the U.S. presidents Oval Office desk at the end of the startling opening sequence in which a blue-skinned fork-tailed beast breaks through White House security vanishes and rematerializes at will and careens off and through walls and ceilings with inhuman speed. Vigorously executed scene is one of the pictures best and has the desired effect of whetting the appetite for a couple of hours worth of intrigue and surprise. Since the Liberty Island fiasco that climaxed ""X-Men"" conciliatory mutant leader and telepathist supreme Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has returned to running his elite school for talented young mutants while his rival the malign Magneto (Ian McKellen) has been confined in a high-tech plastic cell where when first seen he is passing his time reading ""The Once and Future King."" Due to the apparent assassination attempt national tensions about the perceived mutant threat are at a boil. Enlisted to deal with the problem is William Stryker (Brian Cox) a formidable hawk who has excellent intelligence on mutant activities and despite his personal prejudices uses a mutant troubleshooter Yuriko (hot Kelly Hu). Sure that the would-be assassin was sent by Magneto Xavier and his allies are worried their cause of peaceful co-existence will be set way back notably through the imposition of a Mutant Registration Act. Magneto by contrast desires total war as a means to mutant supremacy and Stryker embraces this challenge by invading the X-Mansion with commandos a move that meets with limited success due only to the heroic intervention of the hirsute vagabond mutant with retractable metal claws Wolverine (the wily Hugh Jackman). Once the mutants are flushed out of the school screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris disperse the action to more or less coherent effect and mix in some new characters with the returnees. And everyone gets to show off his or her special talents first just for fun and later in key combative situations the deeply and apprehensively telepathic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen whose seriousness of approach manages to push her character to near-realistic dimensions); Storm (a platinum-maned Halle Berry indifferently used as before) who can stir up the weather; Scott aka Cyclops (the blandly handsome James Marsden) whose perennially shades-covered eyes generate laser-strength rays; Rogue (Anna Paquin) whose talent for absorbing others traits isnt very interesting and her aspiring b.f. Bobby (Shawn Ashmore) whos a junior Mr. Freeze. Adding flavor is Nightcrawler the presidential attacker subsequently revealed to be a devoutly religious German named Kurt Wagner with whom Alan Cumming has considerable fun. But given the most flamboyant opportunities this time around is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. Shes not really fair to the other actors in that she effortlessly steals every scene shes in just by standing around in her blue-hued altogether. When her aptly named character Mystique takes control of the action actress really turns it on morphing from one identity to the next more frequently and much more quickly than Cher changes costumes during a concert. Providing weighty balance on the human side is Coxs Stryker. Although casting the villain as an intolerant right-wing militarist makes for easy caricature Strykers smarts and highly personal motivation break the mold a bit and the ever-resourceful Cox gives the man a stature roughly equivalent to that which Stewart and McKellen bring to their resilient characters. Pics emphasis on mutants as all-purpose outcasts is brought to a head in a scene in which Bobby ""outs"" himself as a mutant to his dumbfounded parents. ""Theres something I need to tell you"" the youngster announces to his folks in an exchange that concludes with his mothers assurance that ""We still love you Bobby."" Thus has the civil rights-slanted agenda that comic series originator Stan Lee intended when he hatched ""X-Men"" in 1963 mutated into a sexual-orientation spin 40 years later. More than the first film ""X2"" is punctuated with fancy action and effects scenes. Some are just tossed off such as those in which a kid named Pyro (Aaron Stanford) casually throws fire around. More spectacular are Magnetos superb escape from his cell a jet dogfight in which Storms sleek plane is stopped inches short of a head-first crash the faceoff between the equally matched Wolverine and Yuriko and all the kinetic antics of Mystique and Nightcrawler. Unfortunately the climax set under a frozen lake and dam where Stryker maintains his secret h.q. goes on way too long although some jumps in continuity especially involving Jean and Scott suggest that there may have originally been even more that was cut out. Given that the hopscotching narrative is not constructed in a way that inexorably builds to a peak of excitement protracted ending envelopes matters in fatigue when it should have left audiences wanting more -- like ""X3"" -- sooner rather than later. Compositions and camera moves worked out by Singer and his habitual lenser Newton Thomas Sigel are handsome and contribute a fair amount of dynamism on their own. John Ottman a Singer regular who did not work on ""X-Men"" returns to the fold to reassert his uniquely ambidextrous skills as an editor and especially as a composer with his own good ideas of how to score a mainstream picture. Very high standards are maintained by production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas costume designer Louise Mingenbach visual effects supervisor Michael Fink and special makeup designer Michael Fink the latter of whom successfully keeps the characters recognizably ""human"" while investing some of them with beastly characteristics. Oddly a screen credit on the original ""X-Men"" noting the storys and characters basis on Lees Marvel Comics series is nowhere to be found this time around.

There are at least three climaxes the nimbly shot action sequences expand in scale and duration and several fresh recruits join the army of chromosomal variants camped at Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters. Stand-out newbie is teleporting gymnast Kurt Wagner (Cumming with Max Schreck teeth) introduced launching a violent one-man infiltration of the Oval Office. He was brainwashed to attack by William Stryker (Cox) a nefarious military scientist who needed ready made justification for an elaborate war on terror mutants. Professor X (Stewart) reluctantly musters his troops (telekenetic Janssen lupine enforcer Jackman ace weathergirl Berry) who forge an uneasy temporary alliance with imprisoned arch-nemesis Magneto (McKellen). The X-Men series brims with allegorical possibilities and this serves up a superb comic book riposte to the current US government crusade of interior surveillance and exterior pre-emption. The emotional spectrum has widened too encompassing buoyant mirth and heroic tragedy. JWin.

"Its Affectionate and Smart And Im Down With Love | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Its Affectionate and Smart And Im Down With Love By Andrew Sarris  05/26/03 1200am Peyton Reeds Down with Love  from a screenplay by Eve Alhert and Dennis Drake turned out to be much more amusing and incisive than I had anticipated when I managed to catch an early-morning screening along with a scattering of other paying customers at the Clearview Beekman Theatre. The studio publicists had earlier sent me a press kit containing footage of all the major players going on and on about what they were trying to do in the film and I found myself developing a premature hostility to yet another movie (along with the ridiculously overrated Far from Heaven ) that promised to display a smug superiority to the films of an earlier period-the implied message being that we in the new millennium are so much more sophisticated than our predecessors. I also suspected that for a supposedly tongue-in-cheek take on the Doris Day-Rock Hudson sex-without-sex comedies of the 60s Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor were obviously miscast. But lo and behold- the movie was so much better than I had anticipated. As it turns out Down with Love hasnt been given enough credit for its affectionate but satirical insights into the early 60s and especially the films of that era. Most of the critics have focused on the retro costuming and paper-moon backdrops to the exclusion of scenes depicting the social and cultural mores at the time. When Ms. Zellwegers Barbara Novak emerges from Grand Central Terminal like a hayseed virgin about to begin her adventures in New York she nearly chokes on all the secondhand smoke in the air. This comically anticlimactic entrance transforms the by now very well known Ms. Zellweger into a visitor from another time ready to mix it up with 1962-but from a discerning distance. Later when her character comes across a cab unloading a contingent of ban-the-Bomb protesters outside Grand Central Terminal the film does at least acknowledge a political presence in the period which is more than A Mighty Wind did. Timing is everything in these matters and happily Down with Love is razor-sharp all the way through. Barbara is soon walking confidently into the main elevator of Banner Books a swanky publishing house only to find herself squeezed in among an army of men in business suits. But before the joke can wear thin she arrives at her floor where she embraces her enterprising editor Vikki Hiller (Sarah Paulson). From that moment on the two women become an item irrepressible color-coordinated partners in feminist advancement. Their joint entrances in restaurants and nightclubs become virtual musical interludes. The two characters complement each other not in the traditional manner of female lead and acid-tongued hanger-on (think Eve Arden or Thelma Ritter) but more like Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russells ""two little girls from Little Rock"" in Gentleman Prefer Blondes (1953). Theres a brief swipe at period sexism in the Banner Books boardroom where Vikki is forced into the position of coffee-server for an array of male chauvinist pigs who enter and exit in buffoonish lockstep (again without wearing out their welcome). Meanwhile the male half of the gender equation emerges in the offices of Know magazine an Esquire -like lair of early-60s masculinity less odious than the post-ironic maleness of Maxim and other ""laddie"" publications now banned in Wal-Mart stores. Mr. McGregor plays Catcher Block Know s ace correspondent and womanizer extraordinaire. David Hyde Pierce (best known as Niles Crane the effete heterosexual brother on Frasier ) plays Catchers comic foil and publisher Peter MacMannus in a role supposedly patterned after Tony Randall vis-a-vis Rock Hudson in those early 60s comedies-though as it turns out not exactly. As Catcher goes after Barbara Peter chases Vikki with all the bravado he can muster. When the two men exchange apartments to facilitate their separate pursuits (Catchers bachelor pad for Peters WASP-ish digs) Barbara suspects nothing though we eventually learn that she is not nearly as naive as she seems. Vikki on the other hand immediately smells a rat when Peter blurts out that the picture on the mantelpiece is of Catchers parents and not his own. Putting two and two together (and getting five) Vikki calmly asks the sputtering Peter whether hes having a homosexual relationship with Catcher. Its O.K. if he is she goes on and it certainly wont stand in the way of her wanting to marry him. This degree of bold effrontery on the subject of gayness wouldve been verboten in the old Day-Hudson pictures but Love s liberating frankness is a refreshing change from the melodramatic theatrics with which the subject was treated in Far from Heaven . Mr. Randall himself now in his 80s takes on a small but telling role in Down with Love as the imperious Banner Books publisher who tries to kill Barbaras proto-feminist best-seller because it has complicated his sexual relations-not so much with his wife as with his mistress. (No gay subtext here.) Having said all this I dont want to exaggerate the significance of Down with Love. Indeed I can almost understand why Im so out of step with those of my colleagues who have panned it. I think it compares favorably with Pillow Talk and Lover Come Back in its well-timed gags and verbal dexterity. But its no classic unlike say Tootsie (1982) or Groundhog Day (1993). In the greatest of all the screwball sex comedies The Awful Truth (1937) theres a suddenly painful poignant moment between Irene Dunne and Cary Grant that Ive always thought of as the Leo McCarey moment when the heart begins to sing right after the laughs. There is no such moment in Down with Love . But theres still a great deal of expertly managed fun and merriment and the unexpected dividend of Judy Garland singing Harold Arlens ""Down with Love"" for real. Must-See Mutants Bryan Singers X2  from a screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris based on the Marvel Comics series X-Men  belongs to a genre from which Id do well to recuse myself. Although Ive been a compulsive reader of newspaper comic strips from early childhood to this day I have never bothered much with comic books-except that is for a brief flirtation with Mad Magazine  mostly for its hilarious send-ups of movies. But with any kind of adventure comic or the more recent phenomenon of the graphic novel its still a resounding No  But having seen and enjoyed X2  I am now determined to catch up with X-Men the comic book as well as Mr. Singers previous movie X-Men (2000)-which is to say in the ancient words of Jerry Lewis ""I liked it I liked it"" The most striking aspect of X2 was for me the actors and their characters especially the women Famke Janssen Halle Berry Rebecca Romijn- Stamos Anna Paquin and Kelly Hu. Considering the macho fantasizing that traditionally goes on in the genre the women make up as rich and varied an assortment of female characters-heart and mind body and soul-as has been assembled in any movie this year. The uber -talented male actors are not exactly chopped liver either. The cerebral Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is the leader of the mutants who wish to live in peace with the humans as opposed to Magneto (Ian McKellen) chieftain of a radical tribe of mutants bent on destroying hostile humanity. In X2  Professor Xavier and Magneto are drawn together in an alliance of convenience against the common threat of Brian Coxs malignantly anti-mutant government scientist William Stryker. Hugh Jackmans charismatic Wolverine brings an X factor of his own into the power balance as he seeks the secret of his own identity while battling Strykers aggressions against the scattered mutant multitudes. Hes assisted by his fellow X-men with telltale noms de mutant like Pyro (Aaron Stanford) Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) Cyclops (James Marsden) and Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming). Faithful Marvel readers can explain all the subtexts better than I can. Suffice to say that I was steadily engrossed and entertained and ultimately moved by a drama that is in the end more human than mutant. Even if like me you consider yourself too serious-minded to sit through an already certified blockbuster not entirely of this world with a cryptic title like X2  give this prolonged splash of special effects a chance. It is better than its genre. Noble Choices Aviva Slesins Secret Lives Hidden Children and Their Rescuers During WWII was written by Toby Appleton Perl and co-produced by Ms. Slesin and Ms. Perl. The title would seem to say it all but what makes this latest sidelight on the Nazi Holocaust more than just another well-intentioned rehash of horror and heroism are the unexpectedly perverse nuances in the films margins. Ms. Slesin knows whereof she speaks because she was one of the child survivors. As the relatively few European Jews who were saved from the death camps recall their Christian rescuers some find themselves feeling both gratitude for these people who risked the lives of their own children to save the children of Jews and a strange lack of empathy when they were reunited with their own parents after four or five years. It remains painfully evident that the rescuers were pitifully few in these societies and vastly outnumbered by the accomplices to evil (which includes both active accomplices and those who maintained a self-preserving indifference). But who among us can say for certain how we would have behaved if presented with the cruel choices faced by those heroic few in Europe not so very long ago? Get a Life Angela Christlieb and Stephen Kijaks documentary Cinemania tracks the obsessive lifestyles of five cinephiles based in New York City. Cinemania is one addiction with which I can identify and sympathize wholeheartedly inasmuch as I have written extensively about my compulsive moviegoing in earlier decades. My friends and faculty advisers often urged me to ""get a life""-which seemed a humdrum bit of advice especially when That Hamilton Woman  with Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier was playing at one of the revival theaters in town. So Im in no mood or position to hector Jack Angstreich Roberta Hill Bill Heidbreder Harvey Schwartz and Eric Chadbourne as they organize their lives around film schedules. I know their pain-and their epiphanies.

The blurb is the work of fancifully named critic Neill Cumpston (as in cum stain?) whose review as posted on the Aint It Cool Web site spoofs geek addiction to Xtc. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> X-Men the first film made from Stan Lees Marvel comic grossed 300 million in 2000 but Cumpston felt shortchanged ""Remember how the first film had all that story (= for gays) in the first part and you were like How bout some ass-kicking already? and then finally they got to it? Not this one. Its like OK theres the credits and now heres the ass-kicking and it starts and doesnt stop and youre all like Pants meet shit. "" Props to Cumpston for wittily epitomizing the devalued state of film criticism. Who cares if X2 has a director a writer or a thought in its head as long as this 120 million epic turns loose mutants to metaphorically bruise our nether regions. That it does. Everyone is pumped up and pissed off starting with director Bryan Singer who reportedly kicked chairs and screamed at the crew. His mood fits the movie. Hugh Jackman is again in fierce lupine form as Wolverine the mutant with metal claws. Pushing the bounds of PG-13 intensity Wolvie stabs his spikes into Deathstrike (the dazzling Kelly Hu) whose talons are twice the size of his. The buzz is right X2 is bigger badder and better than X1. Its also half an hour longer a mixed blessing that allows for (yikes) character development. The two mutant camps -- one led by Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who wants mutants and humans to co-exist the other led by Magneto (Ian McKellen) who preaches mutant supremacy -- unite against Stryker (a terrific Brian Cox) a military psycho with a genocidal rage against mutants and their special gifts. It doesnt help the X-Mens cause when a mutant tries to kill the president in the opening scene. We hear a sound -- bampf -- and there stands Nightcrawler (zesty scene-stealer Alan Cumming) a blue-skinned yellow-eyed fork-tailed demon who teleports past security damn near stabs the prez and behaves unlike the gentle soul he is a German acrobat who enjoys deep religious dish with Storm (Halle Berry still struggling with an underwritten role). Its clear that the good guys are being mind-controlled. Romance also trips up the X-Men. Wolverine is losing telepathic Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) to laser-eyed Cyclops (James Marsden). On the junior X team pity poor Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). His itch for Rogue (Anna Paquin sporting gray streaks) requires safe scratching since a mere touch from her can floor a guy. ""We love what youve done with your hair"" says Magneto lobbing the line at Rogue like a bitchy Cupid. Fun stuff. Hot stuff is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique a naked vision in blue when shes not shape-shifting to get it on with Wolvie as Jean as Storm and as herself. Neat trick. Whats un-neat is how Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris overload the film with new Xers. Pyro (Aaron Stanford) is viably flashy but do we need the steel guy the screamer the girl who passes through walls and the kid with the forked tongue? By expanding the X-Men franchise Singer dilutes the film at hand. As for the death of one major character its less an organic shock than an excuse to get soppy and philosophical. But why rip Singer for defying the rules of ass kicking. If only he defied them more. X2 is a summer firecracker. Its also a tribute to outcasts -- teens gays minorities even Dixie Chicks. Its not without thought or feeling except when its mind gets bent by the gods of box office. Then its craven and empty. Success meet compromise.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 2 2003 1242 PM Save the Mutants The Army targets superheroes for extinction in X2. By David Edelstein Mutant and proud A lot of superhero comic books operate on the principle that their readers will identify passionately with freaky misfits--which wont be a surprise if youve been to any comic-book conventions. In the pages of these comics the bizarre abilities that get you jeered in straight society make you a hero--someone with the power to save the world that shuns you. Nowhere is this theme more explicit than in Marvels X-Men comics which take off from the idea that evolution has produced a class of special people. They might be telepaths or shape-shifters; they might raise storms or punch holes through things with their eyes. But theyve all embraced the label ""mutants"" which is like gays embracing the label ""queers."" And like gay people theyre fighting for their right to be who they are instead of being forced to blend in. If the mutants in this universe are lucky they get whisked away at an early age by Professor Xavier. He takes them to his mutant academy where they learn to use their powers responsibly--and where they can bask in the glow of mutant fellowship. Say it loud Mutant and Proud. Advertisement The first X-Men (1999) directed by Bryan Singer was surprisingly decent. It was a shade stodgy in spots--it didnt have the grand-opera charge of the first Batman (1989). But it was rooted in that agony of other-ness and it had gravitas. The bigger fight it turned out was not against the humans but the lunatic fringe of the mutant class--against Magneto (Ian McKellen) the most powerful mutant of all and his sidekick a slinky metamorph called Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). These two were tired of being mistreated by humans; they wanted to dominate them maybe even wipe them out. It fell to Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his band of raging moderates to keep Magneto in line and their triumph atop the Statue of Liberty implied that humans and mutants might one day happily coexist Give us your poor your weird your fire-hurling your life-sucking ... The X-Men are back in the busier funnier and more involving sequel X2 X-Men United (20th Century Fox)--in which the perils of being an outsider are even more dire. The big new baddie is not a mutant Hes a military guy named Stryker whos like a fanatical Cold Warrior. Played by the great Scottish actor Brian Cox Stryker wants to wipe out the mutant race. He already has Magneto as a prisoner in a fantastic no-metal cage (a walking supermagnet has a way with metal) and his sights are set on Professor X and the mutant kids in the academy. He also has a working model of the professors planetariumlike machine called Cerebro which can put Xavier in telepathic touch with every living creature on the planet You can see how this could be turned into a weapon of mass mutant destruction. Things are no happier for the mutants on the domestic-drama front. Hugh Jackmans sideburned Wolverine with his retractable adamantium talons is still peering balefully into his fog-shrouded past. Anna Paquins tremulous Rogue the post-pubescent mutant who kisses the boys and inadvertently sucks the life out of them has an earnest would-be lover in the frost-bearing Iceman (Shawn Ashmore)--but how do they do it? In the films wittiest and most suggestive scene Iceman ""comes out"" as a mutant to his mutantphobic family His parents question his choices (""Have you tried not being a mutant?"") and take turns blaming each other while his little brother calls the police. The movie has a spectacular new wild card in Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) a blue-skinned German teleporter with hooves pointy ears and stigmata. Before he joins the X-Men and begins to pose religious questions about the higher purpose of mutants he launches a tornadolike attack on the White House materializing and dematerializing in a cackling dervish blur. Its too bad that not all the returning mutants are as lively. Cyclops (James Marsden) whos on the dull side of a romantic triangle has become a stick-in-the-mud while those sleek hottie mutants Storm (Halle Berry) and the disappointingly no-cool-nicknamed Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) have new dos (platinum blond and red respectively) but not alas new personalities. Advertisement What makes the architecture of X2 so much more fascinating than that of its predecessor is that Xaviers and Magnetos teams are on the same side now. But is the enemy of my enemy my friend? Thats one of the movies big teases. You get a clue which way its heading from a scene in which Magneto meets one of Xs students whos played by the hero of last years Tadpole Aaron Stanford. Unlike the more temperate mutants this teenage fire-wielder--known as Pyro--is just a little too in love with his power to singe. The other junior X-Men Rogue and Iceman are always having to muzzle his anti-human impulses but Magneto purrs that the lad is a ""god among insects."" McKellen plays Magneto as royally bored the major questions of his existence having long been settled. In the movies most elegant action scene he insouciantly pulls the iron out of the blood of a hapless guard then sails imperiously out of his cell on something like an iron carpet. The bit is even more glorious than Hannibal Lecters escape in Silence of the Lambs (1991)--and McKellens Magneto actually fits my conception of Lecter more than Anthony Hopkins does. He and Romijn-Stamos polymorphous (and perverse) Mystique make a marvelous tag team She gets a charge out of turning into women and men and Lord knows what hes into. Theyre a much more likable pair than Stewart who somehow seems more priggish here than as Jean-Luc Picard and his dull sidekick Jean. Singer who directed The Usual Suspects (1995) packs a mean comic-book frame but hes not a comic-book director The tone is stately deliberate ""adult."" He makes major strides in the action scenes but hes still a little cerebral for my taste. Theres a terrific kung-fu-with-talons fight between Wolverine and a new improved adamantium-infused mutant played by Kelly Hu but it doesnt have a rabble-rousing ""button."" And the big Cerebro climax doesnt end with the oomph youd get from a more vulgar thriller director. But the movie is in a different league from the standard Hollywood comic-book blockbuster. Its never as simple as good versus evil The three male titans--X Magneto and Stryker--are each convinced his way is right and Singer turns the movie into an epic chess match. Only here the knights shoot lightning bolts and the queens raise storms. My chief complaint is that these mutants are a little--well vanilla. I wish the X-Men had a touch of kinkiness to go with their weird abilities. As it stands theyre like Eagle Scouts with merit badges in telekinesis and energy-sucking and flash-freezing. I guess thats the difference between comic books and hundred-million-dollar movies which are pitched at the mainstream straights. The real deviants we save for indie movies and late-night cable.

"X2 Mutates Into Something More washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen X2 Mutates Into Something More Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 2 2003 Despite cool visual style to spare the original ""X-Men"" film had one small problem. Because the non-comics-obsessed segment of the moviegoing audience had to be brought up to speed catching up with almost 40 years worth of Marvel Comics back story about a league of genetically mutated superheroes in just under two hours the generally engaging story felt bogged down by sluggish exposition. This is not a problem in the rock-em sock-em sequel which moves with the lightning speed raw power and athletic grace of well a genetically mutated superhero. After opening with an effects-heavy scene of what appears to be an assassination attempt on the President (Cotter Smith) by a mutant with the ability to teleport his blue-skinned self from spot to spot (Alan Cumming playing the bat-fanged German-accented Nightcrawler) ""X2"" relaxes its grip on our adrenal glands but only momentarily. Not 15 minutes later the movie barrels into a second white-knuckle sequence in which X-Men honcho Professor Charles Xaviers (Patrick Stewart) School for Gifted -- read mutant -- Children is raided by a team of military commandos intent on . . . well its not immediately clear what theyre intent on but its definitely not good. Left in charge of the students while his colleagues Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) are off hunting down the White House attacker Wolverine (Hugh Jackman looking like a cross between circa-1982 Brian Setzer and Lon Chaney Jr.) must almost single-handedly fend off an army of Kevlar-suited guerrillas. Its a scene that will no doubt deeply satisfy fans of our brooding pompadoured hunk-hero who gets to really pull out all the stops here (not to mention his razor-sharp adamantium claws). When the smoke and mayhem subside several of the kids are missing with the notable exception of the trio known as Rogue Iceman and Pyro (Anna Paquin Shawn Ashmore and Aaron Stanford) three teen freaks whose budding skills are all put to visually stunning use this go-round. Its soon revealed that a villain named Stryker (Brian Cox) is behind the raid on the school and that the presidential attack designed to stir up anti-mutant sentiment among the non-mutant population was just one part of his larger fiendish plan which includes harnessing Professor Xaviers telepathic powers to kill mutants. One man short the X-Men are reluctantly forced to team up with Magneto (Ian McKellen) Xaviers metal-controlling archenemy who thanks to shapely shape-shifting henchwoman Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) has just busted out of the plastic prison we left him in at the end of Part I. Its an unholy alliance to be sure but one that adds a level of satisfying tension to what is already an uneasy confederation of crime fighters what with the still-simmering love triangle between Wolverine Jean Grey and Cyclops (James Marsden) and the ever-present bigotry of ""normal"" humans toward those who are physically different. The group members telekinesis ice breath and flame-throwing eyeballs are all well and good when it comes to teaching ignorant people a lesson but what gives the X-Men universe a degree of appeal beyond the glandular are the layers of psychological complexity that director Bryan Singer working from a screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris manages to evoke in what has stereotypically been considered a one-dimensional medium. True to its dark richly imagined origins and thanks to special-effect technology that serves but does not overwhelm the movies character the fantastic and at times deliciously nihilistic world of ""X2"" is fully believably three-dimensional. X2 (PG-13 135 minutes) -- Contains moderately violent sci-fi action sensuality and a four-letter word or two. Area theaters.

"X-Men United Missing a Why It Spawns Zzzzs washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies X-Men United Missing a Why It Spawns Zzzzs Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 2 2003 If you dream in the language of X if your very being is wound up in X if youre a secret mutant who yearns to be welcomed to the tribe of X if youd rather X than sex or X than cash checks then ""X2 X-Men United"" is for you. Alas for the rest of us its pretty much a ""Whats that all about?"" experience. Of the many comic book superhero movies this is by far the lamest the loudest the longest. Good Lord what an epic sit. My rear end deserves a medal. ""X2"" lacks the playfulness of the witty ""Spider-Man"" it lacks the brooding Gothic intensity of the ""Batman"" movies (particularly the first two) it lacks the gorgeous stylizations of ""Daredevil"" and ""Blade"" it lacks the innocent sense of pure flight of ""Superman."" Its fights and settings are banal its characterizations thin and its art direction nondescript. It lacks just about everything except Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman. The primary deficiency might be called a lack of narrative clarity. Literally for the first hour of this movie you have no idea what its about or whats at stake unless youre so of X you carry the X-cosmology around in your subconscious next to the remember-to-breathe program. This is what happens First they run over there then they run over here. Patrick Stewart as head X Charles Xavier is called upon to issue the necessary exposition to hold all the scenes together but the fundamental conspiracy plot underneath it all is so bland that its difficult to work up the concentration to keep it straight. And the characters Sorry X-fans but theyre really losers. I mean none of them has any particular level of attractiveness. (I know how much that hurts -- but you can get through it I know you can.) One can certainly see the appeal of the conceit to the adolescent mind. Most teenagers their hormones aflame their imaginations aflame their skins aflame see themselves as outsiders in the key of self-pity the melody of self-dramatization. Theyre so alone. Waaaaah But beneath all the self-loathing theres also a kind of narcissism Theyre so damned special. And thats your typical X-Man to a T a spectacular misfit utterly misunderstood yet wondrously special hated by a larger society he is nevertheless obligated to protect. Yet again for us rationalists the nature of the mutations that characterize them seems somewhat unrigorously thought out. The moody Wolverine (Jackman a little old for this kind of silliness) can flash blades out of his wrists. Okay but really how useful is that? Hes no better armed at that point than a man with a bayonet. Then theres a kid who can flip fireballs across the room and another who appears to be able to shoot fire out of his sunglasses. On the other hand Storm (Halle Berry) can control weather Jane Grey (Famke Janssen) can part the waters like Moses and Dr. Xavier appears to be literally able to stop the universe -- that is halt time. So what would a knife fighter have in common with God? Or possibly Im thinking too hard about this stuff. Anyhow in the practical world of the movie the big news is that the two schisms of X unite in this film at least for a time. Good X led by Stewarts Dr. Xavier and Bad X consisting primarily of Sir Ian must join together to prevent a plot to destroy all mutants by Stryker a sociopathic general (oh theres a novel touch) played by Brian Cox. So for a brief shining moment all X is on the same page. Each X is given a moment but fortunately Wolverine and Magneto (McKellen) predominate. Both actors have star quality and although Wolverine doesnt really do much in this film (Jackman is so much better in any movie that doesnt require hair gel mutton chops and switchblades) his charisma draws you to him except when McKellens draws you to him. The rest remain ciphers the saddest being Anna Paquin whose characters mutant talent other than ugly mall-droog hair appears to be to make things happen backward. I guess. Shes some kind of Mistress of Rewind. No one in the movie could really be said to act or if they do the director Bryan Singer shunts them aside so fast it doesnt register. The newest X is the Brit dervish Alan Cumming who has yet to find a home outside of the Broadway ""Cabaret"" that made him a star. Here hes the Man of Naugahyde with the gift of disappearing in a cloud of smoke and reappearing somewhere else a nanosecond later. He looks like a human bat but somehow hes transformed into the cuddly cute one by movies end. I never figured that out. But then I never figured anything out For the non-cognescenti the movie doesnt cash in on any obligations of the genre. No effect stirred me no set dazzled me no fight jazzed me. A big magic jet plane that flies the Xers here and there was crudely imagined poorly integrated into shots and laughingly hollow inside -- the real things are jammed with gear. In the finale the X folk must seize a certain secret installation to preclude Stryker from using the hyp-mo-tized Xavier as linchpin in his GenXocide. This sequence plays out in the interior of a dam for no other reason than if you have a dam you know its going to burst sooner or later. But its a familiar movie place full of hydraulic doors with jagged edges pipes chambers and tunnels. Didnt they film ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" there? I wish I could say it wasnt so but for most of us this ""X"" marks a splat. X2 X-Men United (135 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some sexuality and profanity.

Hugh Jackmans Wolverine is still the serious one in X2. Its X2. Or maybe X+30 as in extra minutes which non-enthusiasts are going to feel. Like a lot of sequels that open in May this is less Marvel-ous than last summers season opener Spider-Man. It could use more surprises and fewer pyrotechnics. But as villain Brian Coxs sidekick Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is so attractive that shes good-looking even when the special-effects people make her blue. Review of the movie X2 ( out of four) Stars Patrick Stewart Ian McKellen Hugh Jackman Halle Berry Famke Janssen Brian Cox Rebecca Romijn-Stamos Director Bryan Singer Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence some sexuality and brief language. Opens Friday nationwide Cox as a political hawk who has it in for Stewarts mutants convinces the White House that the movie-opening attack on the president -- a contender for its best scene -- can be blamed on Stewarts school for brainy mutants. In truth its members are more inclined to give peace a chance than the more militant faction of McKellens Magneto whos now imprisoned. But school residents Halle Famke (Janssen) amp; Co. are no softies when Cox launches an attack on the building. Skirmishes ensue as do hairbreadth escapes -- some in the schools mutant-piloted jet that takes off without I bet a flight plan filed with the FAA. If Romijn-Stamos isnt to your taste the other main addition is another blue character that Alan Cumming makes more puckish than people named Nightcrawler usually are. Theres also a kid called Pyro who ought to hook up on a blind date with the girl Drew Barrymore played in Firestarter. The cast is full of actors who are fun to watch. Besides the aforementioned theres stogie-chomping Jackman who has one super throwaway scene that cat lovers will give a thumbs up. But the longer the movie goes the more its 133 minutes prove wearing. The story tries to develop a love angle between Jackman and Janssen but it doesnt begin to take. And the finale is particularly weak. None of this will matter to the fan base. The movie will give them what they want and it will become the talk of the summer -- for 12 days until The Matrix Reloaded takes control.

Directed by Bryan Singer from a screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. 135 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence some sexuality and brief language. Several theaters. The mutant superheroes are back keeping the multiplexes safe for moviegoers. Bryan Singers ""X2"" like his 2000 predecessor ""X-Men"" is crackling good fun helped immensely by a topnotch cast that seem equipped with superpowers of their own -- whether it be splendid acting chops breathtaking good looks or (hello Wolverine) both. Though the films energy lags a bit in its final half-hour ""X2"" is a wonderfully populated adventure with the franchise even more compelling the second time out because of our familiarity with the characters. And as if the original batch of X-people werent enough ""X2"" introduces a few nifty new ones. Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) with inky-blue skin covered in curlicue carvings makes a stunning entrance whooshing around a room like a crazed bat. Hes a teleporter vaporizing into swirls of black smoke as he instantly reappears somewhere else; throughout the movie he emerges as a strange haunted creature speaking in a phlegmy German accent. Is he villain or friend in the X-universe where labels are dangerous things? Watch and see. More easily categorized is the hate-filled Stryker played to the hilt by Brian Cox so memorably villainous as Hannibal Lecter in ""Manhunter."" (Cox shares a Royal Shakespeare Company background with co-stars Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Watching these guys mix it up biting off their words with chilly precision is a rare treat.) Stryker in fulfillment of the disaster foreshadowed in the closing scenes of ""X-Men"" has essentially declared war on mutants setting into motion a chain of events that causes some unlikely alliances. Also new this time around are Strykers associate Yuriko Oyama (Kelly Hu) aka Deathstrike who has a specific power that makes her a worthy match for Wolverine (or any adversarial manicurist); Pyro (Aaron Stanford of ""Tadpole"") a simmering cauldron of teen rebellion who incidentally can control fire; and a handful of X-kids from Professor Xaviers school who demonstrate such handy skills as walking through walls and channel-changing by blinking. And virtually everyone from the original film is back as is the first films elegant balance of character-based drama zippy effects and wry humor. Theres also superhero teen romance as Rogue (Anna Paquin) whose powers make it dangerous for her to touch another delicately approaches classmate Bobby Drake aka Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). (Iceman is handy to have around; in a pinch he can cool a warm Dr. Pepper.) A romantic triangle looms in the form of Wolverine Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Cyclops (James Marsden). And leading the two X-factions with eagle eyes are Professor Xavier (Stewart) elegant in his silk waistcoats and the imprisoned increasingly pale but ever-intense Magneto (McKellen). Though ""X2"" takes time to explore these relationships its still an action story with some sequences staged as breathlessly as a perfectly tuned roller coaster. A nighttime raid on the school with Wolverine to the rescue like a hairy Superman may cause a few white knuckles as will some topnotch X-fights (my favorite Wolverine and Dreamstrike hissing like cats). But Singers real master stroke is this These are characters about whom we truly care. Theres a welcome if none-too-subtle parallel between the mutants and in real life anyone who doesnt quite fit in. One scene in ""X2"" in which a young X-man decides finally to tell his parents about his superpowers has the ache of a coming-out scene. ""Have you tried ... not being a mutant?"" asks his mom while a bitterly angry family member slips away to enact a revenge plot of his own. And yes that big X-door is wide open for a sequel at the end of ""X2."" Thank goodness.

Starring Patrick Stewart Ian McKellen Hugh Jackman and Brian Cox. Directed by Bryan Singer. (PG-13. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The summer blockbuster season gets off to an early and disappointing start with ""X2 X-Men United"" a splashy and bloated sequel to the 2000 hit ""X-Men."" Stuffed with esoteric detail for the sake of pleasing fans of the Marvel Comics series the movie is overplotted a soulless maze of special effects and relentless action. Director Bryan Singer lends the film a grave and portentous tone for at the heart of ""X2"" is a false metaphor that its filmmakers take quite seriously. It presents a future world in which mutants with physics-defying super powers are popping up within the general population causing panic and hostility on the part of the nonmutant majority. In the movies scheme the mutants are the equivalent of a castigated minority while the nonmutants are a paranoid lot that needs to learn tolerance. But the case as presented in ""X2"" that mutants and humans are all just people and need to get along falls apart on the slightest examination. The mutants arent just people but represent a new subspecies -- stronger smarter and more powerful -- that with time is guaranteed to subjugate humanity and render it obsolete. Humans arent paranoid if the mutants really are out to get them and the mutants have more than scientific inevitability on their side. They also have Magneto played by Ian McKellen as a kind of evil mutant Gandalf who is mobilizing the mutant forces. Intolerance is no more the problem between humans and mutants than it was between the Neanderthal and the Cro-Magnon. But ""X2"" insists that it is with the X-Men providing a Clinton/Blair-like third way between the two extremes. Led by the great psychic mutant Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) the X-Men strive to keep the world safe for both mutants and humans by thwarting the plots of each to destroy the other. That puts its heroes in the awkward and undramatic position of working to preserve the status quo while villains on both sides work for change. In ""X-Men"" this mattered less -- the original had the novelty of the gimmick going for it. And because it was the first film it had to take time to introduce the various characters and their unique abilities. Here its expected that we already know Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) whose knuckles sprout blades whenever hes provoked and Rogue (Anna Paquin) who can steal the powers of fellow mutants by touching them. Also in the gang are Halle Berry as Storm reprising a minor role from her pre-stardom days and Famke Janssen as the telepathic Jean. In ""X2"" the audience is flung into a contested situation. Mutants get into the White House and come within inches of assassinating the president. The presidents subsequent desire to take a harder line toward the mutants leads to the ascendancy of Stryker (Brian Cox) a former military man and career-long mutant fighter. So its McKellen as the evil (mutant) genius versus Cox as the power-mad American military man with the benign X-Men in between. These are traditional movie-villain types -- McKellen smiles eerily while Cox scowls so we understand that theyre morally equivalent. And yet the situation for humans does seem dire enough to call for Strykers harsh strategies. While other human politicians in ""X2"" are demanding ""registration"" of mutants Stryker comes up with an ingenious plan to wipe out all the mutants in one shot. Thats cruel sure but at that very moment Magneto has a plan to wipe out all the humans -- and on paper at least he has a better chance of succeeding. Caught in the middle of the drama are the X-Men who have nothing to do but watch in horror and try to foil each plan. The audience is also caught in the middle put in the position of having to root for nothing to happen which is a lot less fun than rooting for something to happen. In between the explosions and catastrophes the script tries to give each X-Man a moment to demonstrate his or her lovable idiosyncrasies but it all feels as programmatic as a bad ""Star Trek"" installment. As Wolverine Jackman smolders with repressed pain as though he were the star but his plotline is not where the action is. ""X2"" has nothing to do with race relations or relations between cultures and nations but the filmmakers seem to think it does and so the mutant question is handled with kid gloves throughout. But if looked at honestly the difference between the X-Men and Magneto is only one of time line. The status quo favors the mutants. In the end ""X2"" is the film that asks audiences to celebrate the ultimate death of the human race. Such audacity might have been something to build on if only the filmmakers knew what they were saying. . This film contains graphic science-fiction violence.

Directed by Bryan Singer. Running time 133 mins. Rated PG-13 Sci-fi action/violence some sexuality and brief language. 2.5 STARS. Mutants evolved. Why shouldnt sequels? ""X2 X-Men United"" is a substantial improvement over ""X-Men"" in many ways especially in visual and specialeffects departments. Director Bryan Singer returns to lord it over a comic-book universe that dazzles. ""X2"" will undoubtedly make a lot of money as if the Cerebro device were locating wallets and piggy banks instead of errant mutants. But not all is triumphant in sequel land because much of the plain homespun charm of the first installment in 2000 is gone. This is a more impersonal movie - big and slick so much so that when we lose one of the core group of mutants presumably for good (although they tend to be resilient) not a tear will be shed. If youre late to the party here is the premise of the comic-book series Mutants are people who have made a genetic evolutionary leap that endows them with idiosyncratic powers and alienates them from the rest of society. Some of these powers are cooler than others. Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman sprouts painful adamantium alloy claws from his knuckles when angered. Although his powers were reinforced mechanically in experiments he can barely remember those talons are a graceful evocation of the bodys chemical reactions to stress. Halle Berry on the other hand is stuck under a big blond wig as Storm a weather-girl. Conjuring a cold front is too external a talent to get worked up about. The new mutant on the block is Alan Cumming as the incredibly annoying Nightcrawler a blue Bible-thumping Teutonic teleporter. In the first ""X-Men"" we met a school full of ""gifted"" youths under the tutelage of telepathic Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). They were learning to control manifestations of their developing adolescent bodies. Rogue (Anna Paquin) for example didnt have a problem until she reached puberty and found her mere touch was enough to drain the life out of any boy. Will unevolved humans accept mutants and let them be? ""Unevolved"" here carries a double message - it refers to people who are nothing special as well as unsophisticated. So it is no surprise that in ""X2"" the mutants are even more feared and hated. After Nightcrawler penetrates White House security the military led by Gen. William Stryker (Brian Cox) cracks down on the entire mutant population good and bad. So dire is their need they call on the evil imprisoned Magneto (Ian McKellen) for help. The story draws themes from the Norse myths that inspired Richard Wagners ""Ring Cycle"" of operas. But while the first movie made more direct allusions to McCarthyism immigration and the power of hormones and teenage sexuality ""X2"" single-mindedly goes for a gay subtext. Mutants who ""come out"" run the risk of alienating their families being cut off ridiculed and subjected to hate crimes. Magneto makes fey observations and he and Professor Xavier camp it up in this parable about homophobia. It seems too narrow an analogy for so sprawling an action movie. But that wont deter the core audience of male youths. All they need is a glimpse of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique a shape-shifter who when not busy shifting shapes is virtually naked but for body paint. The mere sight of her could trigger adolescence.

Bend It Like Beckham  An 18-year-old Punjabi girl must sneak behind her parents backs to pursue her great passion -- playing football like English star David Beckham -- in director Gurinder Chadhas cross-cultural comedy. In the tradition of such post-Thatcherite British ""inspirational"" crowd-pleasers as The Fully Monty and Saving Grace the comic setups are contrived and the pathos poured on. Yet thanks largely to the natural charm of newcomer Parminder Nagra the familiar emotional button-pushing works and the film is winning. PG (March 12) -- L.L. Bruce Almighty 1/2 In Hollywood where the movie star is God playing Him on screen can only be considered a demotion. Thats just the first troublesome sign for Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty. The second is his devout wish to reunite with director Tom Shadyac the erstwhile Moses who once led him to the golden land of Ace Ventura Pet Detective. So does this strategic return recapture that old cash magic? Only occasionally. Carreys legions of fans will surely come and just as surely will go away neither entirely disappointed nor fully satisfied. PG (May 23) -- R.G. The Good Thief  All artists are forgers and all forgers are exactly what their name so ambiguously implies -- theyre makers and fakers. Thats what director Neil Jordan is telling us in The Good Thief. More to the point thats what hes showing us too since the movie is itself a delightfully wrought forgery one that operates on two planes at once. With a perfectly cast Nick Nolte in the title role its a nifty caper flick that also ponders the aesthetic nature of deception -- a solid work of craft that doubles as a little meditation on art. 14A (April 4) -- R.G. Holes 1/2 Based on Louis Sachars best-selling adolescent novel Holes is a story of child abuse and redemption which all feels rather like Oliver Twist by way of Porkys in a strange Disney movie about a childrens prison where the boys are required to dig holes in the desert. The movie features a big-name cast -- Sigourney Weaver Patricia Arquette Jon Voight and Henry Winkler -- playing second bunch of bananas to the cast of children led by Shia LaBeouf as Stanley Yelnats IV a kid whose family has been cursed by bad luck for four generations. Generous flashbacks to 19th-century Latvia and the old West fill us in on the history of the curse and lead us to its undoing. PG (April 18) -- L.L. Identity  A single-setting thriller Identity opens with its mind nicely intact suffers a major crisis about 30 minutes in then bad turns to worse. In that sense the movie might be said to mirror the career of the poor schnook who made it. Director James Mangold started out promisingly too with a lovely film called Heavy and now its come to this disappering act. All in all it seems a sad case of Le movie cest moi. 18A (April 25) -- R.G. Man on the Train  Patrice Lecontes film is as succinct and deceptively simple as its title. A chance meeting brings together a pair of oldsters from opposing ends of lifes experiential spectrum -- Jean Rocheforts retired school teacher and Johnny Hallydays aging gangster. What follows is a lovely little etude in regret as nearing his curtain call each guy find something to covet in his polar opposite. The result is a contemplative ride through the sad-eyed land of might-have-been. 14A (May 16) -- R.G. The Man Without a Past 1/2 Its indisputably the handiwork of Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki he of the melodious name and the quirky sensibilities. This one which traces the wanderings of an amnesiac through Helsinkis underclass is a typically engaging fusion of apparently opposite qualities -- at once melancholy and hopeful earnest and ironic static and eventful formal in composition and teeming with chaotic life. But that description is windy and Kaurismaki is always succinct. Better just to say hes a humanist bearing honest witness to the human parade. PG (April 25) -- R.G. The Matrix Reloaded 1/2 Mainly it fires blanks. Beyond a glittering sequence or two early on the Wachowski brothers solve the sequel problem in typical and typically unimaginative fashion Just put out a magnified reprise of the original blowing up the trademark scenes so much that they lose their once-crisp edge. So instead of a lethal pas de deux with one baddie our hero now takes on 100 at a single go -- sorry but more corps makes for less ballet. 14A (May 15) -- R.G. A Mighty Wind  The latest mockumentary from Christopher Guest ( Waiting for Guffman Best in Show) spoofs yet another subculture of passionately uncool would-be stars. This time the culprits are a group of sixties folk musicians reunited for a memorial concert. Some of it is broadly silly (The colour-co-ordinated New Main Street Singers have evolved into a cult run by a former porn star) but the music feels authentic especially the reunited This Is Spinal Tap trio of Guest Michael McKeon and Harry Shearer as one-hit wonders The Folksmen. And in the couple Mitch and Mickey (Eugene Levy and Catherine OHara) theres even some real poignancy. PG (April 16) -- L.L. Spellbound  Not many documentaries brighten your day. Spellbound shortlisted for an Oscar this year and a crowd-pleaser wherever its played puts a happy face on the non-fiction flick. The subject matter is smart kids -- at least smart enough to stand up at the U.S. National Spelling Bee hear a really obscure word and sputter out L-O-G-O-R-R-H-E-A. What makes the picture engaging is the extended preamble which zeroes in on eight contestants and serves up a mini-profile of each. Several are the diligent offspring of hard-working immigrants -- a stereotype to be sure but the film cuts through the cliche to get at its heartening truth. F (May 23) -- R.G. X-Men United 1/2 While thumbing through that growing stack of cinematic comic books spare a good thought for director Bryan Singer -- he puts out a pretty distinctive issue and this sequel is no exception. Inevitably Singer is painting on a much larger canvas than in the original and has packed the frame with more sops to the action fanatics. But the brushstrokes are still his own. Theres a continuing delicacy to his direction that gives the audience room to breathe and reason to linger. This may not be a grownup movie but it is a movie that grownups can watch minus the requisite bottle of Excedrin. PG (May 2) -- R.G. Also released today Opening in a number of small theatres across Canada Dracula Pages from a Virgins Diary (above) directed by Guy Maddin is a made-for-TV production which originally aired on CBC last year. Based on the Royal Winnipeg Ballets Dracula the film is a dance production mixed with mordant gothic drama and decorated with bits of deadpan humour. . . . its brilliant wrote The Globes John Doyle after the original airing. Another new release Wrong Turn is a slasher flick about six teens trapped in the woods with ""cannibalistic mountain men grossly disfigured through generations of in-breeding.""

Running time 134 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sci-fi violence sexuality mild profanity). At the Empire the Ziegfeld the Union Square others. ------ X2 is as irresistible as movie-theater popcorn - a lavish reasonably intelligent well-acted sequel with kick-butt effects that outdoes its predecessor 2000s ""X-Men"" in almost every department. Bryan Singer is back in the directors seat and most of the original cast returns for this whirlwind epic which has the wheelchair-bound mentalist Dr. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his band of not-so-merry mutants teaming up with his arch-nemesis Magneto (Ian McKellen) to stop a bigoted military scientist (Brian Cox) bent on ethnically cleansing the mutant population. That Singer has raised the ante is clear from the bravura opening sequence set in the White House. Frightening newcomer Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) - with blue skin a tail and the ability to teleport himself through walls - defies the Secret Service and tries to assassinate the president. Xavier rightly fears the attack will renew calls for a Mutant Registration Act - and worse. Whats worse is the shadowy Stryker (Cox) who launches a SWAT team attack on the Westchester mansion where Xavier trains young mutants to be X-Men. And even worse than that Stryker knows about the device Xavier uses to keep track of all mutants on Earth - thanks to Magneto who has fallen under the scientists control. That is until Magneto busts out of his glass prison - a truly spectacular sequence - with the help of Mystique (sexy Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) his blue-skinned shape-shifting Gal Friday who can impersonate anyone. With Xavier temporarily sidelined under Strykers control its up to Magneto to lead the X-Men who escaped the SWAT attack in an assault on Strykers mountain fortress. Thats where Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) meets up with Strykers mutant sidekick Yuriko (Kelly Hu) who shares Wolverines retractable claws his ability to regenerate himself - and maybe a lot more. Wolverine also has unresolved romantic issues with the telepathic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and her boyfriend Cyclops (James Marsden) - not that Rogue (Anna Paquin) has gotten over her infatuation with the hirsute Wolverine despite her new boyfriend Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). Besides the dependably evil Cox and Cummings scene-stealing Nightcrawler - who turns out to be a deeply devout former circus acrobat and not a bad guy - the other major addition this time around is Pyro whose name is self-explanatory and is played by Aaron Stanford of ""Tadpole."" Her Oscar notwithstanding Halle Berry who returns as the weather-controlling Storm doesnt have a whole lot to do - though she sports a new hairdo. ""X2"" includes an excellent rousing score by the versatile John Ottman who edited the overlong movie - though there is an interesting scene where a budding X-Man ""comes out"" to his family. Like last summers ""Minority Report"" ""X2"" is partly a cautionary tale about the government trampling civil liberties during an ""emergency"" - a theme that couldnt be more timely. But for all of its considerable assets ""X2"" isnt going to be of huge interest to anyone who doesnt want to see a movie based on a comic book.

Just dont compare it to the original. Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Comic Books Movies Entertainment News As movie diversions go theres not a whole lot wrong with ""X2"" Bryan Singers follow-up to the hugely successful ""X-Men."" In some ways ""X2 (which has also been promoted under the title ""X2 X-Men United"") is an obvious improvement on its predecessor It looks more expensive and its special effects seem to swoop out of nowhere -- they blend in with more pedestrian types of reality smoothly and seamlessly. ""X2 is also unapologetically loaded with action There are a gazillion plot sub-threads and every time you think youre going to get a breather some other snazzy bit of business grabs your attention. The one thing ""X2 has little of happens to be the one thing money cant buy poetry. The hardest thing to reckon with is that ""X2 seems just fine immediately after youve watched it. Its intelligently made its filled with characters we can easily care about and it moves swiftly; though its the first of the big summer movies it doesnt feel clogged with its own grandiose intentions. But the worst thing you can do for yourself is to go back and re-view ""X-Men"" just after seeing ""X2."" Much as I enjoyed ""X-Men"" when I first saw it I was rattled by the spottiness of its storytelling; it was designed to jump from plot point to plot point without fully resolving anything demanding that you settle into its rhythms or be trapped in your own plastic prison forever. But ""X-Men"" was undoubtedly the most elegiac comic-book adaptation of the past few years. When the characters spoke to each other -- or better yet touched each other as in the scenes between the thinking-girls redneck Wolverine and Rogue with her lethal fingertips -- the connections between them often shivered with lyricism. As anyone who loves comic books will tell you theres poetry in them but you dont always find it in the words you read panel by panel which can often seem clumsy and stiff. The lyricism of comic books is something that emerges only after you give yourself over to it opening yourself to the overarching mood and delicate subtones that emerge page by page (its not unlike the pleasure we get from moviegoing). In ""X-Men"" Singer understood that delicacy intrinsically. Once you gave yourself over to the picture the choppiness of its narrative retreated like background noise allowing the chemistry between the characters to drift to the fore. Long after the movie ended those interconnections were the things you remembered most vividly. ""X2 isnt nearly that subtle. In fact its barely subtle at all. It plunges you right into its story with very little introductory preamble and thats precisely as it should be Even if youve never seen ""X-Men"" its not hard to sort the characters out as you go along. The plot -- or at least one-tenth or so of it -- involves a nasty former army commander William Stryker (Brian Cox) who with evil on his mind stages a raid on the school for ""gifted children"" (in other words mutants) run by Prof. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). His chief objective is to seize Cerebro a thingamabob that further enhances Professor Xs already bodacious telepathic powers which Stryker plans to use to find all the mutants of the world and do away with them. Stryker tricks the imprisoned Magneto (Ian McKellen) a mutant with uber-magnetized innards into assisting him with this scheme; feeling duped and recognizing how dangerous Stryker is Magneto takes the surprising step of uniting with Professor X his rival and sometime friend. The two of them had split long ago over the issue of whether mutants should prepare for war against the humans who want to marginalize them (Magnetos view) or make every effort to live peaceably among them (as Professor X advocates). If youre not exactly sure what a mutant is all you have to do is watch Theres the svelte cerebral Jean Grey (Famke Janssen subtly making the most of a role that isnt quite as jazzy as those of the other X-Men) whose telepathic powers are considerable although theyre nowhere on a par with those of her mentor Professor X; Cyclops (James Marsden) Jeans beau possessed of energy-beam eyes that he needs to keep hidden behind shades at all times; Storm (Halle Berry) who despite her ability to conjure lightning storms with her eyeballs barely registers as a presence at all; Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) a junior X-Man whose breath can turn a smoldering charcoal briquette into ice; and a new mutant Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) a twitchily elegant ""transporter"" who can whisk himself from here to there in a wisp of smoke. But the three most riveting X-Men here as in the first picture are Hugh Jackmans Wolverine a burly misfit from the outskirts of town (any town) who has the intuition and scenting capabilities of a wolf and who can shoot knifelike claws from his knuckles at will; Rogue (Anna Paquin) a teenager whose mere touch sucks the life force out of a person; and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) a lithe creature covered in silky blue scales who can take the form of any human being or mutant she wishes. Singer understands that the chief pleasure of watching ""X2 lies in seeing how these characters interact and tangle both with one another and with their enemies. The action sequences are nicely shot particularly the ones in which the beefy Wolverine dispatches baddies -- theyre like operatic honky-tonk big and impressive but pleasingly rough around the edges. And there are numerous stunning effects that unfold before us unexpectedly; they intensify the appeal of the actors without crowding it. In one sequence Mystique disguised as a luscious human beauty perched on a bar stool lures a poor working stiff into the mens room and has her way with him. She then turns back into her regular blue self -- her dress opens around her flaring out like an iris and molds back onto her body in a fluid ripple of scales. And in one of the movies most pleasing fillips Iceman (who despite his superpowers is really just a nice average mutant kid named Bobby) blows onto a warm soft-drink bottle that Wolverine has just popped open enveloping it in a fuzzy coat of frost. You Might Also Like In between all the cool stuff Singer and his writers (Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris working from a story by Singer David Hayter and Zak Penn) toss in all the requisite X-Men stuff about honor reluctant heroism and (most significantly) the hardship of being outsiders. Those are the ideas that the X-Men comics created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby have been built on and theyre what has made them so enduring and well-loved. But in ""X2 those themes too often take a back seat to the action. At one point Nightcrawler who is meeting Mystique for the first time asks her ""Why not stay in disguise all the time? Look like someone else?"" To which she replies hardly enigmatically ""Because we shouldnt have to."" The exchange is lovely even though it comes off a little like an authors message -- a reminder to the audience to sit up and pay attention because this movie is really about something more than just kicking lots of ass. And yet ""X2 seems to be mostly about kicking ass. Theres nothing exactly wrong with that; its simply that well executed as ""X2 is it just doesnt have the same resonant ring as its predecessor. The fun of watching ""X2 lies in hopscotching from moment to moment awaiting the clever little touches Singer throws in our path. McKellen is a nasty delight here He deliciously camps up his lines as when reunited with Rogue (whom hed kidnapped for his own nefarious purposes in the last installment terrifying her so much that the experience left a streak of white in her hair) he makes note of her Susan Sontag do and deadpans ""We love what youve done with your hair"" Theres also a terrific moment in which Magneto steps onto a small flying spot that swoops through the air -- he rides it standing erect with his arms folded and every strand of his wavy gray hair in place as if it were a miniature motorized surfboard. There are some fleeting bits of visual poetry in ""X2"" particularly a sequence in which a baddie after being injected with molten metal cries leaden tears (they roll out in shiny-drab rivulets). And three characters in particular give you just about anything you could ever want out of a cartoon action movie. The mere sight of Anna Paquin as Rogue is touching. Shes a girl for whom the pleasure of physical intimacy is impossible and so she wraps herself up in scarves and fitted bodices like the heroine of some mournful Victorian Gothic. She tends to wear trim low-cut tops that emphasize her womanly sexuality but she has to accessorize them with elbow-length gloves that protect the world from her deadly fingertips Her get-ups say ""Look but dont touch"" not because of some confused adolescent prudishness but because her conscientiousness about harming anyone she might come into contact with overrules her desire for physical intimacy. Jackmans Wolverine is a pleasure to watch and not just because with his ham-hock biceps hes a potent reliquary for both homo- and heteroerotic beefcake fantasies. As Jackman plays him Wolverine -- often seen chomping on a stogie his hair teased up into twin points that suggest husky-dog alertness -- is a bold cartoon who nonetheless seems resolutely human. His romantic scenes with Janssens Jean Grey are tactfully underplayed lending the movie just the touch of sweetness it needs. But Im most entranced by Romijn-Stamos Mystique that scaly growly blue Amazon with red hair and eyes to match. Who could love a girl like that? Shes one of the borderline ""bad"" mutants having aligned herself with the wily misguided Magneto (himself a Holocaust survivor -- nothing is black and white in the world of the X-Men). Yet Mystique who rarely speaks is completely arresting. Not just because her painted-on blue costume is sexy (it is) but because her silky half-reptile half-feline way of moving is simply hypnotic. Even the way she fends off opponents with her impossibly long toes is fascinating. Mystique slinks through ""X2 with the mysterious allure of another movie anti-heroine one from long ago Irma Vep the center of Louis Feuillades silent 1915 epic ""Les Vampires."" Irma Vep (played by the legendary French actress Musidora) is a cross between a jewel thief and a vampire; her form-fitting black outfit a unitard that clings to her rounded tummy and thighs was shocking for 1915 but it works today too as a symbol of the mingled threat and promise of womanly sexuality. Mystique like Irma Vep is all threat and promise tiptoeing about in her various disguises but shes most magnificent when shes simply being herself. Romijn-Stamos plays Mystique with an enviable physical confidence. Her movements are her line readings They tell us everything we need to know about her without using anything so mundane as words. She slinks through the movie as if she were on a covert mission to sneak off with it leaving us (not to mention its director its writers and its other actors) blinking in disbelief and wondering ""Where did it go?"" Romijn-Stamos has ""X2 in her pocket. It may be the first big blockbuster of the season. But on her it leaves nary a bulge. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment.

Now X2 X-Men United takes that title and its saying quite a lot. Top comics publisher since the 60s Marvel had long failed to transfer its success to cinemas. Rival DC had Batman and Superman. Marvel had a Fantastic Four film so wretched it wasnt released. But since 2000s X-Men made almost 300 million worldwide Marvel has become a major Hollywood player. Its Spider-Man and Daredevil franchises thrive and a promising The Hulk looms in June. But X marks the spot for its film empire. X-Men was Marvels first smash hit and X2 should be its first smash sequel. Unburdened by the originals stage-setting constraints -- and running a half-hour longer -- X2 is jammed with more action often with a harder edge. Director Bryan Singer (X-Men The Usual Suspects) orchestrates thrilling spectacular highly imaginative battles that are more plausible in their superheroic context than any over-the-top James Bond stunt. Such action owes much to the special-effects magic from a beefier 120 million budget. But X2s strengths also lie in its choreography and conviction. The cast is game and the director is a driven wonderboy who knows his stuff. Like any good action film X2 hits the ground running. In its wild opening scene a mysterious mutant invades the Oval Office to attack the president. Gen. William Stryker (Brian Cox) then lofts the witch-hunting torch of Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) whose McCarthyism ignited the first film. Given carte blanche to attack the ""mutant problem"" Stryker targets the mansion of telepathic Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who tutors teen mutants while leading their do-gooder elders in an X-Men fighting team. Though society still seems distrustful of mutants screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris wisely ditch the antimutant hysteria and hand-wringing martyrdom that drove the first film and monopolized the comics for too long. Stryker has a more personal vendetta and the ubiquitous Cox (he was in six films last year) plays him with coldhearted calculation. His back story also is entwined with that of razor-clawed Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) the fierce X-Man whos haunted by a torturous half-remembered past. Singer explores character complications and lends a coming-out-of-the-closet subtext without sacrificing momentum. The film also ripples with romance without getting gooey. Wolverine telekinetic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and fiery-eyed Cyclops (Scott Marsden) resume their testy triangle while young Rogue (Anna Paquin) has puppy love for Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). Though she won an Oscar between films Halle Berry doesnt get much more of a part as Storm. One suspects her time on the shoot was limited. More potent and -- well magnetic -- is Magneto (Ian McKellen) a rare supervillain with dignity. Hes aided again by shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) a trickster with a meatier part. While Xavier seeks peaceful coexistence between mutants and nonmutant humans Magneto prefers being our godlike ruler. If X-Men movies have one message its a plea for tolerance amid humanitys diversity. Unlike most superhero flicks X-movies are ensemble works bolstered by the spirit and variety of a fighting team. That expands with new characters such as Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) a teleporter with a forked tail and a sensitive side. We also catch glimpses of comics favorites Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) and Dr. Hank McCoy (Steve Bacic). But returnees rule especially Wolverine the charismatic bad boy whos the heart of this story. Some fans felt he was held back the first time; they should exalt in seeing him unleashed here. Amid the mayhem and the mush clever comic bits also arise. But they never teeter toward parody or cartoonish extremes. Shunning the silly costumes and hammy villainy of most comics movies X2 is sleek smart and sophisticated for a far-fetched fantasy. Its magnificent action is reward enough but if you crave more in terms of characters and story youll find no ""mutant problem"" here.

"X2 might get its claws in you - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW X2 might get its claws in youBetter than the original X-Men and benefiting by it the sequel packs exceptional punch.May 02 2003|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer ""X2"" is 2 good 2 be 4-gotten. Brisk and involving with a streamlined forward propulsion its the kind of superhero movie we want if we have to have superhero movies at all.""X2 X-Men United"" is also an improvement over the initial ""X-Men"" venture yet paradoxically it wouldnt be as satisfying as it is if that first one hadnt existed. Director Bryan Singer the key members of his production team and no fewer than nine stars and the genetic mutants they portray return from the 2000 original and all benefit from having the previous effort behind them.If the first ""X-Men"" had an obstacle it never completely overcame it was the time-consuming necessity of introducing the numerous inhabitants of its elaborate world of mutants each with a very specific power from the ability of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to fight like the devil and heal himself to the way Storm (Halle Berry) can control the weather.Overlying this was a free-floating anxiety about whether the result would compel an audience or end up a phlegmatic lox of the ""Daredevil"" variety monumental sums of money expended notwithstanding. All of which made for a film which though certainly more than acceptable was too preoccupied to really get untracked.Still just having gotten it done at all seems to have put everyone involved in ""X2"" understandably more at ease more confident and relaxed. Without those pressures the film was free to in a sense take itself for granted to concentrate on coming up with an involving story and telling it in the best possible way.Though it was put together by a heaping handful of screenwriters (written by Michael Dougherty amp; Dan Harris and David Hayter from a story by Zak Penn Hayter amp; director Singer) one of the virtues of ""X2"" is that its storytelling style is basically matter of fact. ""X2"" doesnt wink at us and doesnt get overly stylized. Its shrewd concern is to make the world its unreal characters share with us ordinary humans as realistic as possible. As director of photography Newton Thomas Sigel told American Cinematographer ""In many ways I think were trying to make films that are closer to Road to Perdition than say Gone in 60 Seconds. ""Even more remarkable ""X2"" doesnt trip over its own logistics even though those logistics were formidable. Shot largely in Vancouver ""X2"" was the biggest movie ever made in Canada complete with more than 60 miles of electrical cable running through a key soundstage and hours in makeup for returning shape-shifter Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) and debuting teleporter Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming).But despite this ""X2"" really wants to involve us in its characters stories to get us on its side and create belief that there is something tangible at stake in what these mutants are up to. Dont be misled were not talking ""The Hours"" here but for a superhero movie its well above average. And this despite the fact that at two hours and 13 minutes ""X2"" goes on longer than it should.Like ""Spider-Man"" which also began life as a Marvel comic ""X2"" mines the romantic conflicts and insecurities of adolescents and those who act like them for much of its emotion. Will the telepathic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) be able to choose between bad boy Wolverine and the clean-cut Cyclops (James Marsden)? How will young Rogue (Anna Paquin) resolve the fire-and-frost conflict between Pyro (""Tadpoles"" Aaron Stanford) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore)? And will any of these people be able to take a break from sorting out their raging hormones to help save the world?""X2"" opens where ""X-Men"" left off with the evil metal-controlling mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen) encased in a plastic prison and kindly Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) the worlds most powerful telepath back running Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters where youthful mutants learn how to live with their gifts.Magneto and Xavier youll remember (or else Ill remind you) had a philosophical disagreement that turned quite violent about the relationship mutants and humans should have on the planet.Xavier rather like the U.N.s Kofi Annan thinks everyone should get along as equals while Magneto borrowing a page from some in Washington thinks because mutants are stronger and smarter than anyone else it makes perfect sense that they rule the world.This internecine conflict however is forced to temporarily take a backseat because of the threat to all mutants presented by Col. Stryker a seriously wealthy military man who wants to do to mutants what Magneto wants to do to humans.Events conspire to give the colonel the ear of the president and suddenly all the worlds mutants face a threat the like of which theyve never seen before.

"More Powers To You - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-X-men More Powers To You`X2 --The Gifted Mutants Are Back For Another Enjoyable Romp Across The Imagination.May 2 2003|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticYou dont have to be a mutant to enjoy at least some of X2 X-Men United the x-pansive sequel to the x-citing if sometimes x-hausting X-Men of 2000.Mutants may have a slightly greater sympathy for the movies heroes -- those super-powered beings who band together to stave off an assault by intolerant human forces.Still even though we humans or at least certain humans are the villains of the piece ordinary people probably wont take offense.We all feel like mutants at some time or other dont we?Like Spider-Man Daredevil and the upcoming Hulk X2 features Marvel Comics characters that date back to the 1960s. The new films mutant honchos are Professor X (Patrick Stewart in full glower) the telepathic wheelchair-bound head of the X-Men or ""good"" mutants and Magneto (Ian McKellen sinister as ever) the magnetism-powered leader of the ""evil"" ones.When William Stryker (Brian Cox) a virulently anti-mutant activist targets all mutantkind the good and evil mutants must join forces to defend themselves.The pacing is better in the new film which isnt as frantic as the first. Returning director Bryan Singer slows things down just enough for each mutant to register as both a power and a person.This time we feel as if were actually getting to know the animalistic metal-clawed Wolverine (Hugh Jackman); the stressed telekinetic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen); the empathic love-struck Rogue (Anna Paquin); the weather-wielding Storm (Halle Berry surprisingly executive); the ruthless shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos); the laser-vision-blasting Cyclops (James Marsden); and all the others.Nightcrawler the most prominent of the half-dozen or so new-to-movies mutants emerges potently in this adventure. Hes a religious-minded blue-skinned superhero who can instantly teleport from place to place accompanied by puffs of black smoke.A scene early on that showcases his powers is one of the films biggest thrills. And it doesnt hurt that Alan Cumming (Spy Kids) who plays Nightcrawler brings a creepy if oddly sympathetic edge to his performance.X2s biggest problem is that the multileveled story and screenplay are credited to five writers including the director and the movie plays that way.There is something satisfyingly epic about the way the story takes place on several fronts at once but as the movie draws to its conclusion you want the various plot strands to come together gracefully.Instead the plot begins to seem impacted so the movie bogs down just when it ought to be taking off.And its a bit x-asperating that the story depends so much on Stryker fighting the mutants with ultra-sophisticated devices that often replicate or co-opt the powers of mutants. If humans can come up with this stuff on our own why would we be so fearful of mutants?Besides its just more fun when mutants with different powers face off against one another.Humans and mutants ought to agree that a lot of the fun in this film is in the set pieces such as Nightcrawlers big now-you-see-him-poof-now-you-dont sequence and in small touches such as the way Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) casually deploys his super-cold powers to chill a soft drink.A nighttime siege of Professor Xs School for the Gifted is haunting with mutant children fleeing every which way. And Magnetos behavior in his metal-free clear-plastic prison may be resourceful enough to impress even Hannibal Lecter.In X2 the whole may be less than the sum of its parts but some of those parts are nifty.X3 anyone? Sure why not?Well be x-pecting it.

Its bound to rack up some serious box-office booty in the two weeks prior to the arrival of The Matrix Reloaded. And its even surer to kick off lots of self-congratulatory backslapping and cigar chomping among the 20th Century Fox brass who sanctioned its making who must be thrilled to have a sure-fire franchise arrive at a moment when even Bruce Willis and John Travolta are no longer guarantors of a movies success. (X2 is scheduled to open simultaneously in more global markets than any film in movie history.) Its the kind of movie destined to turn small careers big and big careers even bigger. So maybe its unfair -- or at least futile -- to expend much energy expressing reservations about X2. Maybe its some kind of authorial self-flagellation to criticize a movie that seems in every way to be exactly what its makers intended. Maybe given how little impact film critics have on the performance of comic-book-derived action spectacles in the first place this space would be put to better use reviewing something more meaningful -- like the wonderful afternoon I spent at the Art Institute of Chicago immediately following the X2 screening or my personal predictions concerning the four remaining American Idol contestants. A thousand maybes. And yet I cant help heaving a huge sigh of despair over X2 -- despair that it isnt smarter or faster or funnier than it is; despair that it isnt more concerned with genuinely moving audiences than with moving the commas and decimal points on the balance sheets of its producers. Most of all I despair (even if its become something of a cliche to do so) at my remembrance of a time when summer movies -- likely the same ones that Bryan Singer grew up enamored of -- were more than just a way of beating the heat and selling tie-in merchandise. Much like its predecessor X2 is a cold unfeeling soulless film a movie with dollar signs in its eyes and adamantium coursing through its veins. And unlike Rogue (Anna Paquin) it doesnt take your breath away; it doesnt daze or elate or stupefy you or give you any of the other senses of thrill that good summer movies are supposed to give you. Whats more when all is said and done it doesnt even feel like X2 has tried that hard. Thats not to say that X2 isnt an improvement over X-Men even a considerable one at that. The action is more muscular and confident this time around; the X-Jet is bigger and more turbocharged; Wolverines (Hugh Jackman) mutton chops have been tapered slightly; and Storm (Halle Berry as the only X-person likely to earn the American Meteorological Societys seal of approval) has traded in her white fright wig for a shorter more stylish model (the original having been donated to Billy Bob Thornton for his performance in Levity). In other words the X-Men are livin large at the start of this new chapter clearly phat from the profits generated by their first movie adventure -- even if James Marsden (as Cyclops) still hasnt found time to consult LeVar Burtons optometrist about streamlining his headgear. The good fortune that comes with having saved the world from Magnetos (Ian McKellen) near-mutant-izing of it has also bought our heroes a couple of new screenwriters -- Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty (joining the originals David Hayter) -- and with them something resembling a plot. X2 concerns the emergence of a Wrath of Khan-like blast from the X-Mens past a human ex-army commander called Stryker (played with swaggering Southern-accented gusto by Brian Cox) who holds all the answers to the mystery of Wolverines claws and whod like nothing more than to wipe all mutants off the face of the Earth. Stryker is a baddie so bad that the X-Men must team up with heretofore personas non grata Magneto and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as arresting as ever in a costume consisting of little more than blue body paint and carefully positioned fringe) to combat him especially when the usually prescient Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) finds himself indisposed at a particularly inopportune moment. And so on and so on in respectable Saturday-morning-serial fashion. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm To say that Harris and Dougherty bring to X2 something of a lighter touch is like comparing the caress of Andre the Giant to that of Arnold Schwarzenegger. For all its ballyhoo about how humans and mutants are more alike than different and cant we all just get along their X2 script (much like its predecessor) doesnt really walk its own talk; its mutants lack the foibles the elemental neuroses that make the great comic-book-movie heroes so endearing to us. Whereas Hayter gave X-Men all of the wit and charm youd expect from a guy whose resume includes vocal performances as the grizzled Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video games Harris and Dougherty are at least open to the more musical qualities of good comic-book storytelling (save for a shockingly unsubtle scene soon to be the subject of much parody in which actor Shawn Ashmores ""junior X-Man"" Iceman ""comes out"" to his suburban-Bostonite parents). They throw Singer some interesting pitches a grander more regal Magneto than the first film; a jaunty barroom seduction scene for Mystique; and a Wolverine/Jean Grey/Cyclops love triangle that will become no doubt the stuff of many fanboys wet dreams. But Singer largely fouls these away -- his posture is too stiff his swing uncertain. (Hes so timid about would-be romantic scenes that they become unintentionally hilarious.) New writers notwithstanding Singers approach to X2 is very much of the ""If it aint broke dont fix it"" school resulting in a movie that even at its best -- a thrilling jailbreak scene thats the closest thing in either X movie to a rousing set piece -- seems tame and unmemorable. Ask around about X-Men and youll hear all manner of excuses especially from folks who claim to like it. Youll hear that the movie was hunkered down by the burden of too much exposition (which it was) by having too many characters (true again) and by last-minute edits designed to bring the running time under two hours (which if anything has made the movie seem longer and more torpid). But what no one seems to be saying -- though its the two-ton elephant rifling through their comic collections -- is that for all his obvious understanding of and fidelity to the X-Men universe Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects Apt Pupil) doesnt seem to particularly like telling fantasy stories. Watching both X-Men and X2 you wait and then wait some more for a measure of real affection (to say nothing of invention) to spill out from the screen -- the way it does in the Lord of the Rings movies in The Matrix and more to the point in Sam Raimis Spider-Man. And it never comes. Singer goes through the hollow motions as well or better than many of his contemporaries (both X-Men movies are preferable to both Blade movies to say nothing of Spawn and Daredevil) grabbing hold of some superficial genre gloss without any of its emotional underpinnings. But neither he nor the actors onscreen seem to be having much fun doing it. This is a movie made by Magneto. X2 | Directed by BRYAN SINGER | Written by MICHAEL DOUGHERTY DANIEL P.

You know the one populated by kids who can walk through steel breathe fire and emit glass-shattering screams. (Wheres Edison Schools Inc. when you really need it?)Headed by the wheelchair-bound Prof. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart looking exceptionally dapper in a series of tailored suits and silk ties) the School for the Gifted of course is home to several generations of mutant misfits that the good professor is trying to keep on the right path using their freakish powers for the benefit of humankind. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) still has that funny coif fierce temperament and retractable talons. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) continues to furrow her brow while exercising her ESP although lately she laments ""my telepathy has been off."" And there are Storm (Halle Berry) Cyclops (James Marsden) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) all hanging out waiting for the action to begin.It doesnt take long. Once again directed by Bryan Singer who gets to work with a bigger budget than he had in 2000s X-Men (the special effects have definitely improved) X2 starts in the White House where the Oval Office is the site of some deadly gymnastics as a hooved blue guy with a tail knocks off a slew of Secret Service agents and comes this close to spiking the Prez. He doesnt get the commander-in-chief but he gets his point across a message nailed to the Presidents desk that reads ""Mutant Freedom Now.""Mutants it seems are everywhere and there are hawkish types in the government who dont like them - who want them to register no less. After the attack on Pennsylvania Avenue (the mutant in question played by Alan Cumming is a Bible-quoting tattooed Teuton) William Stryker (Brian Cox) a former Army commander who heads the mutants-must-go contingent is given the OK to harass Professor X and company. The fact that Stryker has a personal agenda - and personal history with the mutants - doesnt bode well.Where X-Men pitted good mutants against bad as the world looked on X2 aligns Professor Xs crew with the malevolent Magneto (Ian McKellen) and the morphing Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) - united at least for now in battle against Stryker and his saucy aide-de-camp Yuriko (Kelly Hu). (Who in turn has something mutant-y up her sleeve.) There are all sorts of complicated comic-book things going on an attempt to wrest and replicate Xaviers all-powerful Cerebro gizmo; revelations about the origins of Wolverines surly disposition and adamantium claws; teen romance (Rogue and Iceman); turbulence in the X-Jet; and that blue guy Nightcrawler reciting psalms and spewing ooze.In Movie II the X-Men again function as universal outcasts the storys Mutant Registration Act certainly echoes the current climate of domestic xenophobia and as hate-objects the mutants could represent any number of racial or religious entities. Theres even a veiled and amusing ""outing"" scene in which Bobby Drake a.k.a. Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) comes out of the closet and confesses to his parents and younger brother that hes really a well a mutant.It would have been nice to see more of the not-so-everyday goings-on at Xaviers school and more of whats bothering Jean Grey (besides the competing ardor of Wolverine and Cyclops) and more of a global perspective in this latest mutant crisis. As it is most of X2s action is restricted to the Northeast Corridor with a climactic face-off in the western Rockies where in typical blockbuster fashion everything goes kablooey and ka-bam. Dams break vehicles explode and the world is safe for another day - and another X-Men sequel.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.X2 X-Men United  (out of four stars)Produced by Lauren Shuler Donner and Ralph Winter directed by Bryan Singer written by Michael Dougherty and Daniel P.

"X2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; x2 ) X2 (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli The problem with X2 is essentially the same one that plagued X-Men too many characters resulting in too little screen time for each one. X2 may be the most ambitious superhero motion picture to date but it doesnt work quite as well as Spider-Man or Superman both of which are in some ways inferior. The reason is simple in those movies we get into the skin of the protagonist whether its nerdy Peter Parker or bumbling Clark Kent. In X-Men and its sequel there are simply too many heroes running around. Unless youre a fan of the comic book series you need a cheat sheet to keep them all straight a and that doesnt count the cameos (Colossus Kitty Pride Jubilee etc.). To be fair X2 does a better job than X-Men primarily because it isnt saddled with the baggage of having to introduce everyone. The only new major mutant is the blue-skinned teleporter Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming); everyone else is a returning player. Nevertheless most of the X-Men come across as no more three-dimensional than their comic book counterparts. There are a few exceptions with tough guy Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and telepath Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) leading the way. And one could make a case for teenager Rogue (Anna Paquin) and arch-villain Magneto (Ian McKellan). But theres still a lot of underused talent. Patrick Stewart (as Professor X who runs the show) for example is completely wasted as is Halle Berry (as weather-controlling Storm). James Marsdens Cyclops with his laserbeam eyes has about the same amount of paltry screen time as he had in X-Men. Shapeshifter Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos) gets more exposure but her personality remains a black hole. Overall however once you get past issues related to trying to figure out who everyone is how they relate to one another and what their powers are the movie turns out to be pretty entertaining a at least as good as the first one and perhaps a little better. The ending is a little anti-climactic but there are plenty of good action sequences leading up to it. And depending on the direction in which the filmmakers decide to go the closing sequences could represent a nice set up for the third movie. (Those familiar with the comic book series in the late 70s and early 80s can make some educated guesses about what may happen next.) The story picks up where the first movie ended preserving continuity. Wolverine is in the process of tracking down his roots Magneto is trapped in his metal-deficient prison and the mutant issue is being widely debated on a national political level. Then when the mysterious Nightcrawler sneaks into the White House and nearly assassinates the U.S. President General William Stryker (Brian Cox) a man with a vendetta against mutants is given special powers to raid Professor Xs school and detain everyone there. Suddenly the mutants are scattered and under siege Professor X is captured and brainwashed to be used as a weapon of genocide against his people Magneto is free and working with the X-Men and Jean Grey has discovered the terrifying depths of her mental powers. As the war begins the casualties mount on both sides. Visually X2 is a sight to behold with impressive special effects and a dynamic sense of place. There are some standout sequences. The first and most memorable opens the movie with Nightcrawler teleporting and fighting his way through an army of Secret Service agents on his way to the Oval Office. Later Wolverine squares off against Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) whose claws are as sharp as his. Theres also a nifty scene in which Pyro (Aaron Stanford) uses his fire-controlling abilities to hold off the police. He loses control and is only stopped when Rogue brings him to heel. The appeal of X2 is probably less broad-based than that of a Spider-Man or Superman. Although its possible to enjoy this movie without boasting any familiarity with the comic book (or for that matter having seen the first movie) director Bryan Singer has developed this project with the fans in mind. This is a Valentine to them and they are likely to be the most enthusiastic respondents to the film. Yet as big as Singers canvas may be he has yet to acquire the knack of how to metamorphose his ensemble from a group of comic book icons defined by their powers to multi-dimensional cinematic individuals. Thats the quality that holds back X2 a instead of being a great movie its merely a solidly entertaining one. And an element of tragedy that occurs has far less impact than it might have had in a better rounded picture. X2 is a good way to start the 2003 Summer movie season and its a worthy companion piece to its predecessor but for comic book fans in search of the Holy Grail the quest must continue.

"CNN.com - Review X2 a superior sequel - May. 1 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Review X2 a superior sequel More bigger better By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine in ""X2 X-Men United."" Story Tools RELATED  X-Men sequel opening big -- very big  Superheroes dominate movie summer (CNN) -- Its a rare occurrence indeed for a sequel to be anywhere near as good as the original film. But thats the case with ""X2 X-Men United."" In fact the new film may be better than the original. This time out theres more action more character development more special effects and a much bigger budget. The last item is no surprise after all the original made 157 million at the box office and thats just domestically. More important however the ""X-Men"" creative team -- led by director Bryan Singer (also known for 1995s ""The Usual Suspects"") -- is back both in front of and behind the camera. There are some highly entertaining additions to the cast as well. The X-Men are part of a group of mutant human beings and as the first movie revealed theyre not always tolerated by the mainstream population. ""X2"" begins with a breathtaking action sequence in which the president of the United States is attacked in the Oval Office by a mutant despite the fact that hes surrounded by Secret Service agents. This blatant act is just the motive needed by Gen. William Stryker (Brian Cox) a mutant-hating military man and scientist. Stryker has a very complicated background involving the worlds most powerful telepath Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his Xavier School for the Gifted where mutant children find acceptance and learn how to use their unusual powers. Picking right up Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is Mystique in ""X2."" Other key players are exactly where there were when the original ""X-Men"" movie left off Magneto (Ian McKellen) is still in his plastic prison; Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) is still blue and looking good while looking for ways to free her leader; Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has just returned from a failed mission to uncover his mysterious past; and Dr. Jean Grey (Framke Janssen) Cyclops (James Marsden) Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Storm (Halle Berry) are all going about their ""normal"" routines at the school. After the incident at the White House Stryker attempts to use the presidents fear to reinstate legislation for the Mutant Registration Act. He then convinces the government that Xaviers academy is really a mutant training center aimed at taking over the country -- and the world. The general gets the OK to check out the situation but instead secretly launches a full-scale military offensive on the school and the stage is set for a full-fledged war between humans and mutants. As the title suggests all the mutants on earth -- including Xavier and his students and Magneto and his cohorts -- have to leave their deep differences behind and unite against Stryker and his evil plan. The best new character is Nightcrawler played by Alan Cumming. Raised in a traveling circus Nightcrawler can teleport from one place to another and looks like a blue-skinned demon with pointy ears yellow eyes hooves and a prehensile tail. He speaks with a German accent and is very gentle and extremely religious -- when hes not being controlled by a secret third party. Like Romijn-Stamos Cumming was subjected to hours of intense make-up in order to transform into his character. Other cast additions include Deathstrike played by Kelly Hu and a new student at the Academy named Pyro played by Aaron Stanford. If his name doesnt tell you his mutant power youre just not paying attention. Lots of action -- and great hair Famke Janssen is Jean Grey and Halle Berry is Storm in ""X2."" Both characters have gotten spiffy new hairdos. As the mutants battle for survival intensifies the PG-13 rated carnage rages. That translates into lots of fight scenes but very little stage blood. The result is a fast-paced slick flick that races toward a spectacular climax. All the main themes are still firmly in place. ""X2"" continues the originals morality tale about prejudice and the fear of the unknown. Acceptance is still at the heart of the story. And yes Virginia the ending is a huge setup for ""X3."" Another sequel is more or less a certainty. A word about ""X2s"" hair Few movies have ever put so much focus on tonsorial splendor. Storm Rogue and Jean all have great new dos though Xavier is still bald and Wolverines hair still looks like two miles of bad road. Fortunately Stewart and Jackman have other assets. And be sure to look for the letter X. Singer and production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas placed numerous subliminal X images throughout the film. The first one comes at the very beginning of the movie with the logo of the studio -- 20th Century Fox. ""X2 X-Men United"" opens nationwide on Friday May 2 and is rated PG-13.

And ""X2 X-Men United"" is a much better movie than its 2000 predecessor.The new movie based once again on the Marvel Comics tales of heroic mutant super-heroes and super-villains not only maintains the franchise but gets right much of what the first movie--a big popular but roaringly vacuous special-effects extravaganza--tended to botch. This time ""X-Mens"" unusually good cast (Hugh Jackman Ian McKellen Halle Berry Patrick Stewart) dont seem to be wasting their talents while spouting cliches and cavorting in campy super-outfits. And gifted director Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"") seems to be having fun with the material instead of being overwhelmed with special effects. This movie lets the characters and tropes borrowed from the original Stan Lee comic live and breathe.Its not a wholesale change just an upkick in quality and smarts. As before ""X2"" is the tale of a group of super-hero mutants with wild talents--Jackman as sharp-clawed Logan a.k.a. ""Wolverine""; Stewart as wheelchair-bound paterfamilias Dr. Charles (""X"") Xavier/Cerebro; Famke Janssen as noble Jean Grey; Anna Paquin as reluctant Rogue--and the hassles they got from rival mutant superbaddies Eric Langsherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) and the devastating Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as blue scaly super-chameleon Mystique.The story is pretty much the same as before and as always for this type of movie--or graphic novel. The bad super-villains put the world and our superheroes in a perilous fix but the forces of good fight back and blast through. (Am I giving away too much?) Its a very familiar story fodder for hundreds of movies and thousands maybe millions of comics. But this time the script by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (working from a story by Singer and Hayter) has more bite zest and snap. The settings which include The White House and a vast dam laced with tunnels and underground chambers are more portentous or evocative.While the first movie lacked the perverse confidence and impudent razzle-dazzle of Singers ""Usual Suspects""--as well as the lightness wit personality or magic movies like this can always use--""X2"" redresses the balance. Its fun and exciting. You can watch it without flinching. Back are all the actors that helped make a hit of ""X-Men"" and there are some stellar additions notably Alan Cumming as the living gargoyle Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler and Brian Cox in a superb bit of business-as-usual arch-villainy as William Stryker a vengeful human scientist who wants to rid the world of all mutants--and has kidnapped both Stewarts Cerebro and McKellens Magneto to do it.The original cast had qualities that eventually triumphed over a really bad script in the first ""X-Men."" Jackmans squinting Eastwoodesque surliness balanced against the elegant Brit savoir-faire of Stewart and McKellen the youthful empathy of Paquin and the va-va-voom pulchritude of triple knockouts Berry Janssen and Romijn-Stamos. But Cox is this movies X-factor. One of the best and most magnetic heavies in modern movies (he originated the part of Hannibal Lecter in 1986s ""Manhunter"" and almost matched his successor Anthony Hopkins) Cox gives ""X2"" a nasty shiver of menace and pinions us with his hulking grace dry threats and dolorous eyes. As head of the forces of bigotry--which also include Bruce Davisons close-minded Senator Kelly--hes so bad he makes both McKellen and Romijn-Stamos temporarily look good. (He also has an attractively evil new sidekick Yurika Oyama/Deathstrike played by Kelly Hu.)Like last years Marvel Comics movie behemoth ""Spider-Man"" ""X2"" fills its blockbuster parameters and also has a good time with them. There are big explosive set-pieces of course notably a spectacular escape scene with Magneto and Mystique and a pulverizing Hong Kong-style duel-to-the-death between Wolverine and Deathstrike. But ""X2"" also has the dramatic glue to hold everything together. It may not surprise us much but it doesnt exasperate us either--as long as you have the barest tolerance for this kind of story which millions do.At the heart of the story is the notion that society persecutes its outsiders mavericks wild talents and even dissidents at its peril that its better to understand than to annihilate. Thats a simple message and one that forms the core of most of the super-mutant sci-fi tales (from ""Odd John"" to ""Slan"" to ""More Than Human""). But its more resonant here than it was in ""X-Men."" Theres some feeling here especially in the last scene with Jean Grey. The movie in defiance of all our expectations achieves a little feeling amid its sturm und drang.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesX-ceptional piece of crapMay 26 20063rd X-Men marks a spot on the downward curveMay 25 2006Find More Stories AboutIan MckellenTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-05-02/entertainment/0305020284_1_ian-mckellen-movie-x-men-united,200,x2x-menunited31,x2x-menunited,chicagotribune

Or superheroes. Now I realize that I neednt be defensive in front of erudite fanboys. I may have no passion for mediocre comic-book superhero movies like ""X-Men"" which came out three summers ago - let alone junky derivatives like the recently released ""Bulletproof Monk."" But without ever having heard of Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) before that tattooed teleporting devil-tailed psalm-chanting German-accented mutant made his attention-grabbing entrance in the opening scene of X2 X-Men United I fell completely and happily under the sway of this new and improved sequel. My erudite-fanboy colleagues at EW are delighted because the movie wastes no valuable time explaining to newcomers why Magneto (Ian McKellen) is locked up in a plastic prison or why the return of the broody adamantium-clawed rebel without a cause Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is such a big deal to telekinetic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) weather-manipulating Storm (Halle Berry) life-sucking Rogue (Anna Paquin) wizardly Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the students at that Hogwarts alternative Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters. Hanging on for the ride while Nightcrawler storms the White House (to the tempestuously prayerful German-accented strains of ""Dies Irae"" from Mozarts ""Requiem"") were on our own to recall that at the end of ""X-Men"" a bigoted human constituency was pushing for a speciesist Anti-Mutant Registration Act. And that the mutants themselves were divided between those fighting for equal rights and the segregationists who favored Mutant Power. I on the other hand am delighted because director Bryan Singer has learned - perhaps from the grace and warmth of Sam Raimis ""Spider-Man""? - that for all the fun things he can do with special effects and the siren call of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos splendiferous figure as the shape-shifting Mystique flashy showdowns matter little if theyre not grounded in a witty appreciation of human vulnerability; our own weakness is what makes superhuman powers so alluring in the first place. ""X2"" revisits the rivalry between Professor Xavier and Magneto and their respective mutant congregations and introduces some new recruits. (Among his many assets Rogues adoring classmate Iceman played by Shawn Ashmore can chill a soda bottle nicely.) But the real menace fomenting unrest with all the sneakiness of a Tom Clancy Cold War-era bad guy is the twisted human ex-Army commander Stryker (Brian Cox who better?) who particularly enjoys tormenting Wolverine. And for all the showpiece action sequences (the best of which involve Mystiques nifty chameleon work and Nightcrawlers delightful whooshes through walls trailing plumes of blue smoke) these superheroes are most appealing during their downtime. Jackmans hunky magnetism (have his claws gotten bigger or is he just glad to see me?) is never so strong as when Wolverine is padding down the hallways of the X-Mansion silently howling for Jean Grey. McKellens Magneto is never so suavely perverse as when hes lolling in his cell like Hannibal Lecters fellow prisoner-with-fine-diction. In moments of humor - especially when Cumming is on the screen his Nightcrawler a fabulous amalgam of devil Boy Scout ""Cabaret"" habitue and Church Lady - ""X2"" sparkles with a lightness of spirit that was missing from ""X-Men."" And so while I still find Big Showdown scenes more perfunctory than satisfying - and theres a get-ready-for-""X3"" reel of them here including an extended kung fu face-off between Wolverine and Strykers mannequin-blank assistant Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) - theres invigorating charm in X2s many scenes of unhurried playfulness and gentle puns on serious themes of tolerance. ""Why not look like everyone else?"" Nightcrawler asks Mystique. ""Because we shouldnt have to"" she replies oblivious that most human men would leap tall buildings in a single bound if their women could look like her blue scales and all. Having mastered the big adventure picture and demonstrated his respect (required by fanboys) for the conventions of comic-book zaps and oofs director Singer now also exhibits a welcome patience with the small adventures of human comedy. When junior member Iceman - known to his Muggle-minded family as Bobby Drake - brings a couple of the senior X-Men to his parents Boston home the concerned mother asks the son who has turned out so different from the young man she thought he would be ""Have you tried not being a mutant?"" Anyone who has ever revealed an anxiously held personal secret (Homosexual? Kosher? Republican?) knows that being a mutant isnt a choice and that authenticity is the source of all superheroism in comic books and in life.

He didnt ask for the ability to soar to have his senses tuned to an impossible acuity to be a hulk or a vampire; it just came over him like the surge of puberty. His gift isolates him from society bruises and confuses him. And since he is not always in control of his power it becomes an addiction in need of medication. If only there were a therapy group for his kind -- a Superheroes Anonymous. That was the notion behind X-Men a school for mutants run by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) mind bender and father figure. Director Bryan Singers first XMen a hit from summer 2000 was basically Men in Black from the point of view of the humanly challenged sure the earth is overrun by odd creatures but we must nurture them and harness their strengths not send out the feds on an ethnic-cleansing orgy.

Singer saw the first film as a primer; now he has eyes for an epic. X2 is half an hour longer miles more ambitious and a bit better than the wowless original. This time the sacred monsters must battle not only their fellow-mutant nemesis Magneto (Ian McKellen) and the morph-o-matic Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) but also a figure familiar from a quillion adventure movies -- the steely sicko military renegade. Stryker (Brian Cox) is an ex-Army conniver who would use X powers to evil ends and has a kung-fu cutie named Oyama (Kelly Hu) to kick start any fight. Stryker must contend with a late recruit to the coalition of the thrilling Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) whose powers include walking through walls vanishing in a plume of fume and reciting the 23rd Psalm in a German accent. The only cunning wrinkle in this series is the collective hero a dozen or more supernal types each bending the laws of physics in a peculiar fashion each trying not to obstruct the others while implicitly angling for a spin-off series of his or her own. Though this tactic offers a pleasing congestion it risks piling on -- cluttering the narrative with myriad subplots. Singer figures the audience wont mind as long as the actors have the requisite dishiness. As they do. Janssen can look into our minds anytime. Jackman on the verge of stardom for three years grows ever more appealing. The yummy Romijn-Stamos could start her own Las Vegas mime act Blue Man Boobs. To lend a whiff of aristocracy to his enterprise Singer relies on the orotund majesty of British thesping. Stewart and McKellen give heft to their respective patriarch and pariah. They make each debate on the shaky future of mankind sound as if it were taking place in the House of Lords -- even if they are both forced to sport the goofiest headgear in fantasy-film history. X2 wants to contain multitudes -- high ideals and high tech the poignant and the silly. Doing so it becomes a lexicon of modern filmmaking. It could be its own creature Super-Generico. Thats not the worst thing for a movie to be but its not quite Marvel-ous either.

Hoberman Risk Management Tuesday April 29 2003 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Can the depressed adenoidal schlub hold the movie? Hoffman in Owning Mahowny.photo Ava Gerlitz A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - A bone-dry comedy Richard Kwietniowskis Owning Mahowny is based on the true story of the unprepossessing Canadian bank drone Brian Molony who back in the early 80s managed to embezzle some 10 million all of which he lost at the gaming tables of Atlantic City. So pleased was the casino to have his business that toward the end of his 20-month spree they were flying him in from Toronto on a private Lear jet no questions asked. Psychologists of gambling refer to a first ""winning phase"" in which betting is experienced as a self-validating activity and pleasurable thrill; Owning Mahowny however opens with Dan Mahowny (Philip Seymour Hoffman in a relentlessly self-effacing performance) already in his losing phase taking increased risks and obsessively chasing his losses. Mahowny is 40000 in debt to bookie Frank Perlin (Maury Chaykin) when he flies to Atlantic City with 100000 skimmed from a clients account and promptly loses the entire bundle. Albeit given to superstition and mood swings Hoffmans Mahowny is basically an automaton in the grip of a bad program. Kwietniowskis gamble Can this repressed depressed adenoidal schlub hold the movie? Although the action is framed by a psychotherapeutic session the audience is never privy to Mahownys consciousness. Rather one is invited to be impressed by the spectacular impression the badly dressed barely communicative Mahowny makes on the cold-eyed casino manager Victor Foss (a superbly vulpine John Hurt). This single-minded gambler turns down all offers of free booze food and sex. All he wants to do is lose his money ""Hes a beauty--I love him"" Foss cackles from his surveillance aerie expressing an excitement that seems totally beyond frozen-faced Mahowny. Purist that he is Mahowny is constantly raising the stakes in his ongoing embezzlement but however mighty his temporary gains his hard-wiring is such that he is never able to leave the table with any winnings. And yet it would not be entirely correct to characterize him as ""luckless."" Mahowny does have a faithful fiancee Belinda (Minnie Driver) who in her irrational devotion to this unresponsive lump seems no less obsessive-compulsive than he. And even more amazingly Mahowny (who turns out to be a master at schmoozing his greedy superiors) is a veritable Matrix-man successfully pirouetting around a fusillade of bullets that range from bank audits to surprise upheavals in the accounts hes been juggling. Remaining largely outside gambler psychology even as he accentuates its repetitive rhythms Kwietniowski establishes an equivalence between corporate bankers and casino managers--both eagerly exploiting the bad judgment and addiction of their clients. (The eccentric Perlin is an exception--his only apparent means of collecting on Mahownys debts is to deny him any more credit.) Kwietniowskis first feature Love and Death on Long Island was also a comedy of mad passion. There however his protagonist was fixated on a human object (Jason Priestley) and hence appeared more poignant and ridiculous in his desire. Owning Mahowny shares the earlier films crisp precision but its a far more rigorously sublimated and abstract account of lamour fou. Mahownys alienation is mirrored in the movies deliberately antiseptic artificially illuminated environment. Although overtly concerned with the tasteful theatrics of power Kwietniowskis direction is so hushed that it runs the risk of seeming dull. As air-conditioned as its mise-en-scene is Owning Mahowny takes a long time to reach its boiling point. By the time the cop tapping Perlins phone becomes aware of the mysterious Mahowny and wonders aloud what these ""clowns"" might be up to you realize that its a literal characterization Mahownys blank face and broken-down jalopy Belindas big blond wig and oversize glasses Perlins every utterance are strictly from the circus. The bookie even has the custom license plate ""KAR TUN."" Directed by John Malkovich from Nicholas Shakespeares adaptation of his 1995 novel The Dancer Upstairs is an ambitious political thriller set in an unnamed Andean country. A revolutionary cult modeled after Perus Shining Path is waging a war of terror against a corrupt government. Only the cops are honest or at least one detective Agustin Rejas played by a suave and sleepy-eyed Javier Bardem. The minions of the mad Maoist philosophy professor who calls himself Ezequiel have signaled their sinister presence in the capital by leaving dead dogs hanging from the lampposts. Chickens explode in the marketplace and every time theres a blackout the adherents of Communisms self-proclaimed ""Fourth Flame"" set off fireworks in the form of the hammer and sickle. Soon the terrorists are using children and fashion models to deliver their bombs and even attack the audience of an already abusive avant-garde theater piece. The latter ploy provokes the government into not only declaring martial law but massacring a group of innocent drama students. For his part Agustin--who was born in the highlands--is haunted by a videotape of Ezequielism in action. A girl from the cops native village coolly executes the local priest hed once served as an altar boy. Closer to The Quiet American than Collateral Damage lacking neither atmosphere nor moral dilemma The Dancer Upstairs is appropriately foreboding even in its violence. Theres no way for anyone to keep their hands clean. In essence Ezequiel is a serial killer--precisely the sort of self-aggrandizing over-intellectual villain that Malkovich himself has often played. (Of course the actor has more recently taken the part of F.W. Murnau in Shadow of the Vampire and appeared as a somewhat lesser maestro in Manoel de Oliveiras Im Going Home.) In any case The Dancer Upstairss emphasis is less on madcap Ezequiel than on the brooding boring Agustin. The stage is set for bourgeois tragedy as this emphatically good man saddled with an aggressively superficial wife grows fascinated with his 10-year-old daughters comely ballet teacher Yolanda (Italian actress Laura Morante). Initially engrossing The Dancer Upstairs slackens in its second half--particularly as the viewer like Ezequiel can easily keep a few steps ahead of dogged Agustin. Shakespeares novel had the benefit of a more complex and distancing narrative structure which the movie cannot reproduce. (Instead Malkovich frames his story with a live recording of the late Nina Simone introducing and singing ""Where Did the Time Go?"") Given the abundance of solemnity and absence of suspense The Dancer Upstairs could easily have lost 20 minutes--starting with the yodeling ""All Along the Watch Tower"" that Yolanda uses to choreograph her dance to the martyred drama students. After a shape-shifting blue terrorist attacks the White House and very nearly impales the president an arrogantly bigoted personification of the military-industrial complex (Brian Cox) begins agitating for a Mutant Registration Act--and worse. Sound familiar? Although a good 40 minutes longer than its predecessor X2--Bryan Singers sequel to his millennial adaptation of the venerable Marvel comic book X-Men--is an equally nifty action ballet. The movie is funny reasonably crazy and unpretentiously faithful to its source. Theres no overweening design. The incoherent gothic/chrome dome/cybercity/plastic fantastic mise-en-scene is frequently disrupted by rhapsodic dreams and recovered memories and the effects are often playful as when the mischievous metamorph Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) vamps the ever excitable Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Yet the movie is remarkably unfacetious in part because Singer clearly respects the various hang-ups that bedevil his outcast mutant protagonists. The X-Men mythology has its baffling aspects but the movies ensemble format insures that the mutants personalities will be as boldly telegraphed as their idiosyncratic powers (or the actors ripe perfs). Halle Berry seems understandably bored as the silver-haired lightning goddess Storm but Famke Janssen brings near lunatic conviction to the role of the agonized telekinetic telepath Jean Grey. Patrick Stewart is a bit of a snooze as founding father Professor Xavier; the juiciest line readings belong to Ian McKellen as his bad-boy rival Magneto. Theres a priceless bit where Magneto and Mystique share a snigger over the hyper-sensitive junior X-Gal Rogue (Anna Paquin) ""We just love what youve done with your hair."" On a less successful note the resident new kid-cum-Jar Jar Binks Alan Cummings cowering Nightcrawler has a propensity to babble the Lords Prayer in a heavy Bavarian accent. The original X-Men comic books were a smoldering Breakfast Club of adolescent ressentiment and Singer remains true to his school. A jealous kid brother routinely drops a dime on his mutant sib; the collateral damage from an inexplicable lovers tiff fissures the Alpine equivalent of Grand Coulee Dam. For the moody neurotic persecuted denizens of this Kmart Olympus its a nonstop teenage gotta-gotta-Gotterdammerung. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.
