"Chainsaw prequel is a cut below - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Chainsaw prequel is a cut below By Rocco Colella Globe Correspondent  |  October 7 2006 Poor Leatherface.He never quite made it into the top tier of slasher-movie killers ( Jason Freddy and Michael ) so it doesnt come as a surprise when we see him angrily hack up beef in the local slaughterhouse. And especially not when we see him driving a chainsaw clean through the pretty boy hes always wanted to be.The new prequel ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning"" isnt really a slasher movie at all. Its a mess with too much to say and an odd genre in which to preach . Strange pro-war sentiments are prevalent throughout. Its 1969 and the world is divided by the conflict in Vietnam. So are two brothers Dean and Eric. Dean (Taylor Handley) wants to dodge the draft and head to Mexico with his girlfriend while Eric (Matthew Bomer) is proud to go back to fight overseas as his girlfriend shrugs .Erics girlfriend is played by Jordana Brewster the films biggest name. Shes so static that when she runs through a glass window during a climactic scene it seems way out of character.While intended to be a prequel to the remake this is basically a remake of the remake. Director Jonathan Liebesman relies too much on cringe-inducing gore. Those who stomached Eli Roths ``Hostel"" have already watched unnecessary surgery performed without anesthesia. Even ``Nip/Tuck"" has shown ickier facial removals. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Murder amp; Mayhem Are in the Blood washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Murder amp; Mayhem Are in the Blood Jordana Brewster portrays a waylaid road tripper terrorized by Leatherface and his cannibalistic clan in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning."" (Photos By Van Redin -- New Line Productions) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday October 7 2006 Perhaps its misleading to praise ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning"" for its positive family values. But we do note that the Hewitts -- the Texas relations at the center of this horrorfest -- say grace before dinner and show deep love and support for one another. Were almost reluctant to mention their tendency to apprehend slaughter and eat anyone who passes through their rural hamlet. But the Hewitts are doing the best with what they have which in this economically impoverished corner of Texas is nothing. The one who prepares their cannibal spread of course is Thomas a.k.a. Leatherface the marauding butcher of the original 1974 ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" who never met a visitor he couldnt dismember dice and debone in time for supper. Sadly this movie is a far cry from the atmospheric even thoughtfully crafted original which made you truly scared for the unkempt everyman victims. But this latest version though just as grisly is literally hackwork and stars a forgettable airbrushed cast of slaughterees. A brief recap of the chainsaw chronicles There was 1986s ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" which featured Dennis Hopper as a vengeful Texas cop. Viggo Mortensen popped up in 1990s ""Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III"" and 1994s ""The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" starred Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey. But all you need to know this weekend is that ""The Beginning"" is the prequel to 2003s ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" which in turn is the remake of Tobe Hoopers 1974 original the big bang that started it all. As the latest movie shows us Thomas (played here and in 2003 by Andrew Bryniarski) is just a misunderstood psychotic who was teased as a child for his disfigured face and in later years denied gainful employment when the local slaughterhouse was closed down in 1969. Have no fear horror fans ""The Beginning"" may get mushy about Leatherface and his family but it spares no detail -- not a one -- when it comes to showing the Hewitts first round of victims. When he hears about the factory shutdown Thomas sledgehammers his supervisor to death. And his adoptive uncle Charlie (R. Lee Ermey) feels obligated to blow out the brains of the sheriff who comes to arrest his nephew. Charlie takes over the sheriffs badge uniform even his identity. And waste not want not That old Sheriff Hoyt makes one heckuva dinner. And of course there are the four kids (a bell-bottomed Jordana Brewster is the best known) who make the unfortunate mistake of getting into an accident on Route 17 one July day on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert (its 1969 remember). Little do they know theyll be playing involuntary air guitar on meat hooks before the day is through. Is there much more to tell you? We will say we have never seen a 300-pound woman (shes called the Tea Lady and we remember her from the 2003 ""Massacre"") used as a doorstop. And we couldnt help but laugh when Sheriff Hoyt/Charlie compliments his nephew on his new face mask which Leatherface obtained the hard way from one of his victims. But we also noted the tenderness in the compliment and the twinkle in his uncles eyes. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning (84 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for hard-core violence and gore profanity and some sexual content.

A prequel to the 2003 remake of the Tobe Hooper classic it purports to explore the background and mythology behind one of cinemas greatest horror icons. Yet this plotless pointless piece has nothing to say about the nature of the beast choosing instead to wallow in the brutal violence and nihilism of the dysfunctional family from hell. Oppressive mean-spirited and sadistic The Beginning is an unsavoury exercise in cruelty and pain that one hopes will also be the end.

(AP Photo/Newline/Van Redin) Photo VAN REDIN Leatherface was just born horrible as it turns out 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning Horror. Starring Jordana Brewster Taylor Handley Lee Tergesen and R. Lee Ermey. Directed by Jonathan Liebesman. (R. 82 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) The problem with a prequel to a horror film is if you think about it for any length of time you can figure out who lives and dies from the start. Thats just one reason that ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning"" becomes a lot more enjoyable if you can leave your cognitive skills at the door. The film isnt quite as polished as the surprisingly decent 2003 remake of Tobe Hoopers splatter classic but it still delivers enough gore and style to satisfy fans of brutal violence dark humor and no logic. The chain-saw-toting human-mask-wearing Leatherface was the franchise player in Hoopers 1974 ""Chainsaw"" movie but the producers wisely changed things up for the 2003 remake giving lots more screen time to his sheriff uncle played to character-actor perfection by R. Lee Ermey. Ermey was an audience favorite and he pretty much carries the film this time delivering vicious smackdowns and droll one-liners like the hillbilly version of a good James Bond villain. Director Jonathan Liebesman doesnt even pretend that you should be rooting for the victims who stumble upon the house of horrors -- the bad guys are way more charismatic and seem to get all of the quality dialogue. After an incredibly difficult-to-watch credits sequence that includes the bloody birth of Leatherface -- seriously anyone who is even slightly squeamish should not see this film -- the movie jumps ahead to 1969. The typical core group of horror film victims (the Sensitive Guy the Loose Cannon the Skanky Girl and the Slightly Less Skanky Girl Who Makes Stupid Decisions) are traveling through the middle of nowhere when a confrontation with some bikers leaves them stranded a few hundred yards from one of the most infamous psychopath families in movie history. The story this time is much weaker than the original focusing on two guys who look as if they should be in a 1990s boy band but are supposed to be going to Vietnam. And the fantastic cinematography and production design of the remake are mostly a memory. But Liebesman and screenwriter Sheldon Turner have a good idea what audiences like and there seem to be more clever dialogue and memorable scenes of carnage this time around -- including the most humorous double amputation in recent memory. Ermey in particular takes a few routine lines (""Thats the ugliest thing I ever saw"" he says upon gazing upon baby Leatherface) and makes them hilarious just with his timing and emphasis. In the end ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning"" proves that some characters just dont need a backstory. While its worth exploring Vito Corleones Indiana Jones and even Hannibal Lecters pasts finding out that kids used to pick on Leatherface at school only makes him less scary. All you need to know about the character is hes really crazy and carries a chain saw. And hes got an even crazier uncle who all but steals the film. -- Advisory This film movie contains every horrible thing youd expect from a movie with the words ""Texas"" ""chain saw"" and ""massacre"" in the title plus a few you never would have thought of.

Expectedly grisly pic provides the origin story for Thomas Hewitt aka ""Leatherface"" -- which means these kids are little more than chainsaw fodder. In light of the 2003 Michael Bay-produced remakes 80 million box office take expect this entry from ""Rings"" helmer Jonathan Liebesman to scare up healthy numbers. Dont get too attached to any of the nubile young twentysomethings in horror prequel ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning."" Expectedly grisly pic provides the origin story for Thomas Hewitt aka ""Leatherface"" -- which means these kids are little more than chainsaw fodder for the Ed Gein-inspired cannibalistic killer. Whereas the three ""Star Wars"" prequels set up key events foreshadowing young Anakins turn to the dark side implication here is that Hewitt was always evil. In light of the 2003 Michael Bay-produced remakes 80 million box office take expect this entry from ""Rings"" helmer Jonathan Liebesman to scare up healthy numbers. From Jasons ubiquitous hockey mask to Mike Myers William Shatner disguise masks play a crucial role in American horror movies and none is scarier than Leatherfaces homemade version ripped fresh from the faces of his victims and stitched together to cover his deformity. Though ""The Beginning"" offers few psychological insights into Leatherfaces behavior it does give bloodthirsty fans the chance to witness the masks grisly creation. Hewitts sorry life dawns in a seedy slaughterhouse that circa 1939 has seen none of the reform Upton Sinclair advocated in ""The Jungle."" Sitting at a fly-covered conveyor belt a pregnant meat inspector keels over backward and convulses as her hideously deformed baby claws its way into the world unassisted. Left for dead among the meat scraps the child is rescued by a local dumpster digger and brought home to proud papa Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey). Thirty years later the slaughterhouse has failed a health inspection but one hulking employee (with a makeshift mask) refuses to put down his meat cleaver. Unprovoked young Thomas Hewitt (Andrew Bryniarski) bashes his boss head in then looks for a better weapon. Soon he spies -- illuminated like Excalibur by a shaft of heavenly light -- the power tool that will make him famous. The sheriff (Lew Temple) finds Hewitt still carrying the chainsaw. Foolish enough to leave his shotgun on the dash and Hoyt in the passenger seat the sheriff gets out of the car to confront the young man. Turns out Hoyt has an even greater taste for blood than his adopted son and he shoots the sheriff from behind. Later serving the mans remains for dinner he drawls ""We aint never gonna go hungry again."" As scripted these scenes might have played for camp or comic effect but Liebesman hews close to the 2003 pics bile-tinged snuff-film aesthetic. His approach falls somewhere between the overwrought sadism of the ""Saw"" series and the giddy gore-for-gores-sake energy of ""The Devils Rejects"" sharing those films twisted notion that todays auds are willing to embrace such homicidal maniacs as heroes. To jumpstart his killing career all this backwoods Hannibal Lecter needs is victims and ""Beginning"" dutifully supplies a fresh quartet of over-sexed youngsters to fit the bill -- two boys bound for Vietnam and their girlfriends along for the ride. Of the four Jordana Brewster escapes much of the movies brutality outliving her less fortunate co-stars long enough to find a ""Wolf Creek""-worthy surprise waiting in the backseat of her getaway vehicle. Purists who wondered what had become of the family dinner scene (left out of the remake) should be pleased to find an even creepier version recreated here. Auds would be well advised not to attempt ""Beginning"" on a full stomach. Technical aspects mimic the 2003 pic which traded originals low-budget verite style for a more contemporary musicvideo look.

We know nobody from the family of maniacs in Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning will die because we already saw them all alive in 2003s TCM A New Hope. That means anyone looking for the returning Sheriff Hoyt to get punished for R. Lee Ermeys grody overacting here is screwed. So is this movies youthful cast who number only four so that they may be tortured slowly -- its the modern mode of horror -- and artlessly. Unlike Hostel or Wolf Creek TCMB is rank and depressing.
