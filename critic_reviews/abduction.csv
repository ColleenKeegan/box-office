It stars Taylor Lautner (pictured) the rippling dead-eyed mannequin who made his mark in the Twilight films and whose inspiration seems to be the young Schwarzenegger. Hes a dirtbike-riding beer-chugging mixed-martial artist bad boy of suburban Pittsburgh and then one evening while surfing abduction websites (as you do) he spots a picture of his younger self. Next thing he knows there are gun-toting hoods at his door threatening to kill all his Facebook friends so its a big ol cross-country chase to find his real identity with the cheerleader from across the street in tow. While the ultra-banal dialogue draws the occasional titter the action scenes are tame and its rife with plot holes that you could navigate a burning blimp through.

Mom (Maria Bello) has closed the door behind her so Nathan and Karen are alone with the motocross posters and conspicuously propped-up snowboards. The Web soon yields a missing-person rendering of Lautners face--uncannily age-adjusted from a photo of Nathan as a young child--giving the self-described ""stranger in my own life"" something to really think about Who are his real parents? And did ""Dad"" (Jason Isaacs) mean him actual harm when they beat the crap out of each other in the backyard? Nathan immediately avails himself of the sites live-chat feature (we glimpse the man behind the interface a human tattoo in Brighton Beach) and soon finds himself on the run with Karen after his house explodes caught in the middle of a skirmish involving rival black-ops agents the CIA (represented by Alfred Molina) and a guardian therapist (Sigourney Weaver). Most of this takes place in and around Pittsburgh and none of it has anything to do with abduction. Between chases and Bourne-like bursts of violence Lautner gets emotional restating the obvious ""I just saw my parents get murdered in front of my eyes"" he says at one point looking very much like a stranger in his own performance.

"Abduction | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; abduction ) Abduction (United States 2011) September 24 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Perhaps the only way to approach Abduction that will not result in a 105-minute boredom-induced coma is to think of it as a comedy preferably with a drinking game attached. There are laughs to be had although none of them are intentional. Girls (and gay guys) enraptured by Taylor Lautners smoldering eyes and well-formed pecs arent likely to be overly concerned about his wooden dialogue delivery or unchanging facial expression but everyone else will be chortling. This is a miscasting of mammoth proportions. It boggles the mind that someone thought Lautner could make it as an action hero. On some level I suppose it makes sense. Looking at a specimen like Arnold Schwarzenegger arguably the biggest action icon of the 80s one could develop a model nice chest bulging biceps limited emotional range incomprehensible dialogue delivery. The problem is Schwarzenegger was always a ""mans man"" whereas Lautner is generally despised by straight males of all ages. That makes Abduction an action/thriller with females as its primary audience which is box office poison. Over the years with rare exceptions action films have struck gold on the strength of teenage boys. Abduction starts out in suburban Pittsburgh where Nathan (Lautner) lives in high school bliss with his mother Mara (Maria Bello) and father Kevin (Jason Isaacs). He has a crush on the unbelievably hot girl across the street Karen (Lily Collins) but other than staring at each other with deep soulful looks (lingeringly captured by Peter Menzies Jr.s camera) they dont do much in the way of interaction. Nathans life falls apart when one day while surfing the web for a school research project he stumbles upon a ""missing children"" website that leads him to believe his mom and dad may not be his real mom and dad. Some bad guys led by rogue assassin Kozlow (Michael Nyquist the male protagonist in the Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and its sequels) are suddenly after him as is the CIA led by Agent Burton (Alfred Molina). Once his ""parents"" are dispatched Nathans only allies are Karen and Nathans shrink Dr. Bennett (Sigourney Weaver) who becomes like Obi-Wan Kenobi in a pantsuit. First of all it must be acknowledged that the storyline for Abduction is shit. Its not silly or campy or deliciously over-the-top. Its mind numbingly awful. It rarely makes sense and seems to have been made for people who routinely dont pay attention or spend half the movie texting and visiting the snack bar. The movie ends with a huge WTF? anti-climax. I can never remember an action film concluding in quite such a lame manner. It doesnt quite fall into the deus ex machina family but its close. Can anyone imagine Arnold or Sly allowing one of their movies to end this way? What happened to the basic rule that the hero and the villain must go at it one-on-one? The director is John Singleton. That John Singleton. The one who made his feature debut with the searing Boyz N the Hood. Admittedly hes done his share of slumming since then but this represents a new low. The man must have been hard up for work to agree to helm something this lifeless. Singleton goes to great pains to draw a double line between the good and the bad. (The whole movie is ugly.) This is perfectly illustrated during a high profile chase through the concourse of the Pirates baseball stadium. Nathan runs around people and when he accidentally bumps into one he pauses to apologize. Kozlow on the other hand plows through pedestrians knocking them over with abandon as if hes playing a video game in which points are tallied by collisions with innocent bystanders. Abduction also features a fight on a train that may have been inspired by the classic one in From Russia with Love but its hard to tell. The similarities could be a coincidence and the intensity of the battle is more than a notch lower. Lautners limitations are on display from his first scene. Admittedly he should not be judged based on his performance in Twilight and its sequels; those movies have an uncanny ability to suck the life out of even the most talented performers (Kristen Stewart Dakota Fanning). However if Abduction represents Lautner at his best he wont be playing Hamlet any time soon. He is well-matched in Lily Collins who equals him in both physical attractiveness and thespian ability. Whereas Lautners expression is always one of brooding indifference hers is one of whiny pouting. They spend a lot of time staring at one another and even make out once but theres no hanky panky. This is PG-13 after all. Lautner doffs his shirt twice. Alas the topless count for Collins is zero. This is PG-13 after all. Singleton has amped up the ""star quality"" of the production by recruiting ""names"" for secondary roles probably in the vain hope that their presence will lend a patina of respectability to this misbegotten production. Their screen time disqualifies them for more than an extended cameo. Maria Bello and Jason Isaacs are eliminated at the end of a long and tedious introductory segment. Alfred Molina who looks like hes wearing one of William Shatners old toupees and has undergone some sort of face transplant appears from time-to-time at key moments but never sticks around. And Sigourney Weaver shows up long enough to pick up her paycheck. Maybe she heard Ghostbusters III calling. The bottom line is simple Abduction (a title which makes no sense by the way) has been made exclusively for the Taylor Lautner faithful. No other audience could focus exclusively on the actors looks and ignore everything else in the movie. Card-carrying member of Lautners fan club will be delighted because hes on screen for about 100 minutes does the James Dean thing on a motorcycle flexes his muscles at every opportunity and strips down to his pants on a couple of occasions. For those who are indifferent to Lautner or who dont like him the only way to survive Abduction is under the influence of a controlled substance and even that may not be enough.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet With the seminal 1991 message-movie Boyz N The Hood John Singleton made a strong challenge to Spike Lees self-appointed title as the cinematic voice of black America. Twenty years later Singleton has made Abduction another story about a teenager with daddy issues but this time hes firmly in work-for-hire mode. Perhaps not coincidentally Abductions strongest scenes center on the simultaneously tender aggressive and fraught relationship between Twilight werewolf Taylor Lautner a high-school student who has always felt out of place (with good reason) and father figure Jason Isaacs a demanding engaged patriarch whos spent much of Lautners life training him for a destiny he cant begin to understand. When Isaacs departs the film he takes a lot of its soul and substance with him. Lautner lends his usual air of feral intensity to the role of a typical teenage boy whose life takes a strange turn when he finds an image that looks suspiciously like him on a website about abducted children. Lautner soon discovers that his life and his familys lives arent at all what they seem and he embarks with classmate Lily Collins on a journey to discover his true identity. Alfred Molina picks up an easy paycheck playing a shadowy CIA operative and Sigourney Weaver lends the film more dignity than it deserves as a therapist whose history with Lautner and his family goes a lot deeper than she lets on. What teenagers havent felt out of place in their families? Abduction boasts a potent central metaphor for the alienation and dislocation of adolescence but Singleton is less interested in exploring the allegorical or psychological dimensions of that premise than in hurrying Lautner from one indifferently executed setpiece to another. Singleton seems engaged only when dealing with the father-son bond but even there he transforms the films greatest strength into a cornball weakness by having Isaacs words of wisdom and counsel appear in Lautners mind during key moments as if he were a more terrestrial Obi-Wan Kenobi. Singleton once radiated ambition and vision. These days he seems to be aiming for mediocrity at best. Even by those extraordinarily lenient standards the inessential perfunctory Abduction falls short.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 23 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Sep. 22 2011 550PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Taylor Lautner puts the abs in Abduction but not much else. The new action-thriller is designed to help the star establish an identity beyond his sex symbol role as Jacob the werewolf in the Twilight series which comes to an end next year. On paper this story of a suburban kid who ends up tumbling through the rabbit hole of the Internet into a world of international espionage sounds moderately promising. In practice the movie is inept the least competent effort in the uneven career of director John Singleton ( Boyz n the Hood 2 Fast 2 Furious) whose uncharacteristic tentativeness suggests he wasnt sure whether he was directing an adult thriller or a Spy Kids movie. Opening scenes see Nathan Price (Lautner) a loutish high school senior carousing with his buddies and attending a drunken school party. He wakes up the next morning on a lawn with his shirt off (which raised cheers from his Twilight fans) and gets a ride home from his dad (Jason Isaacs) who instead of giving him a stern talking-to pushes Nathan into a strenuous workout followed by an interminable martial arts battle while a content mom (Maria Bello) watches through the kitchen window. Okay thats odd. It comes to pass that Nathan while researching a school project sees his baby picture on a missing childrens website and surmises that his tough-love parents may be frauds. His investigation leads to a home visit from mysterious men and soon Nathan finds himself on the run with his teen neighbour and crush Karen (Lily Collins of The Blind Side). As we learn through jumpy cross-cut sequences Nathan is being followed by a bad Serbian (Michael Nyqvist best known for his role in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and a suspicious CIA agent (Alfred Molina) each vying to capture him for a digitally encoded list of names. Employing an inexhaustible supply of cellphones surveillance cameras and tracking and listening devices the pursuers fill up the dialogue with deadening talk of co-ordinates and interception points. The idea here apparently is to create a sort of junior version of The Bourne Identity in which the hero is on the move attempting to discover who he is but in contrast to the model the action in Abduction feels devoid of urgency. Explosions rarely involve bodily risk; hand-to-hand fight scenes feel over-staged and all the hot cars chic safe houses and sexy train compartments are set decor. There are a couple of train sequences that stand out but only for their awkwardness A squirm-inducing episode where the young couple grind and grope a bit but dont go all the way apparently for ratings reasons. Theres also a risible fight sequence in which Nathan hallucinates his father coaching him through the punches and kicks. Collins all long hair and open-mouthed bewilderment seems sweet but her character is underwritten. Lautner for his part seems stuck in werewolf mode - teeth-baring squinting and chest-baring - failing to establishing the emotional foundation of a compelling protagonist. Still it would be unfair to blame the teen actor for not rising above the material. Veteran stars look weak here Molina walks through his part with a half-ironic detachment; Sigourney Weaver who pops in at the films beginning and end as Nathans shrink drily intones her lines as if reading off a Teleprompter. Whether the fault was haste or cynicism Abduction feels like a movie designed to ride on the back of Twilights phenomenal success with held noses and paycheques all around.

Theres a stylized quality to his features -- not just the lupine snub nose but the daggerish Son of Spock eyebrows that lend him a squint of intensity even when not very much is going on. That face gives Lautner one advantage as an actor Hes a great camera subject like the young Matt Damon crossed with Tom Cruise. It also gives him a disadvantage When the blankest look youve got is already ""intense"" how do you show greater intensity? You squint a little more. Packed with stoic tattooed Serbian hitmen and hairbreadth escapes (are you yawning yet?) Abduction is a ""high-powered"" potboiler that merges the Bourne genre with the junior-assassin thriller Hanna. Lautner plays the secret teenage son of a CIA superagent; when his cover is blown he and his eye-candy schoolmate (Lily Collins) are pursued by foes and tracked by a CIA overseer (Alfred Molina). Director John Singleton offers bits of suspense but Abduction is less a movie than a piece of engineering a glumly ludicrous cat-and-mouse blowout designed to win Lautner male fans along with his girl demo. Hes not a terrible actor but if he wants a career after the Twilight fades hell pick better films.

(Bruce Talamon) Joe Neumaier Friday September 23 2011 1118 AM Title Abduction With Taylor Lautner Lily Collins. A teen goes on the run after discovering his past. Director John Singleton (146). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.The unveiling of Taylor Lautner with his marshmallow-valentine face and magazine-cover abs as an action hero feels like a soda flavor aimed at kids -- those wanting a fizzy jolt are the obvious audience.But even that crowd may tag ""Abduction"" in which Lautner (ahem that would be one-note werewolf Jacob? From the ""Twilight"" movies?) plays a teen eluding what seems to be a planet of spies as a ridiculously cheesy confection filled with unthrilling thrills bored-looking adults and a comically overstuffed backstory.Lautner is Nathan the usual rough-and-tumble high schooler eager to get wild with his buds. You can tell theyre movie kids because they say things like ""This is hot"" ""You are crazy"" and ""Were here to party""But all the fun ends when Nathans parents (Jason Isaacs Maria Bello) are killed by unknown assailants after Nathan discovers he was a missing child as a youngster.It turns out the couple who raised him werent his real folks. Nathan is really the spawn of super-deadly rogue spies who hid their offspring with another family after ticking off both the CIA and Russian operatives - sort of like ""Spy Kids"" meets ""Harry Potter.""When Nathan is pursued while seeking his real dad he and his neighborhood crush Karen (Lily Collins) get all ""North by Northwest"" and go from Pittsburgh to Virginia to um Pittsburgh again on the only Amtrak train thats bigger than a shoebox and doesnt smell of feet.The only fun here is as usual at the expense of the grownups. Sigourney Weaver is a secret agent gone undercover as a shrink who cant shake the thera-speak; Alfred Molina is a mercurial spy chief who may as well be twirling a big moustache and Michael Nyqvist is an Eastern bloc meanie straight from an 80s James Bond film. They all do their best to keep the younguns entertained.But the movie is on Lautners buffed-and-puffed shoulders especially since director John Singleton (still the youngest director to be nominated for an Oscar for ""Boyz N the Hood"") strolls through the action including a snore-filled conclusion at a Pirates game.Lautner crinkles his eyes perks up his nose and clenches his jaw as he plays at being the hero. Hes a man-pup snarling through videogame-style dangers but if you think hes hot and this is crazy then hes here to party.Magic Moment While evading killers on a train the teen heroes find a compartment with room for a makeout break.

"""Abduction"" movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review AbductionTaylor Lautners shirtless torso may thrill a segment of the audience but director John Singletons listless film about a young man chasing down his past wont engage many others.September 23 2011|By Glenn Whipp Special to the Los Angeles Times Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins star in ""Abduction."" (Bruce Talamon / Lionsgate )Not long into the so-so action thriller ""Abduction"" Lily Collins is living every teen girls dream hanging out in Taylor Lautners bedroom. No a| its not like that. Theyre two high-school seniors sitting on opposite ends of the bed while researching a class project on missing children. Theyre scrolling through pictures of kids on their laptops guessing what the children might look like today. For the Record 726 a.m. Sept. 23 The headline on an earlier version of this online article incorrectly referred to Taylor Lautner as Tyler. Landing on one boy sporting a strong jaw Collins stammers ""Matt Damon meets a| you"" Aaaah a| you dont say? So might that make ""Abduction"" the story of a physically gifted young man forced to go on the run because of a significant unremembered event in the past Lautners ""Bourne""-again baptism by fire into modern-day action filmmaking? And if the answer is that obvious can the movie be worth seeing? Team Jacob members will certainly think so if only because Lautners sensitive young stud in ""Abduction"" isnt far removed from the pining werewolf he plays in the ""Twilight"" movies. They both have anger issues yes but they also can be achingly sweet and vulnerable and protective a and shirtless when appropriate. (And with Lautner there never seems to be an inappropriate time.) Early on we do find Lautners character Nathan Harper in that particular state of undress after he has a bit too much to drink at a high school kegger. When Nathan arrives home the next morning his father (Jason Isaacs) is ready for him. ""You want to drink like a man you gotta fight like a man"" he tells his son proceeding to engage Nathan in a little mixed martial-arts brawl that goes well beyond your standard father-son roughhousing. Nathan does have a reputation. Hes seeing therapist Dr. Bennett (Sigourney Weaver) for insomnia impulsivity and anger issues. Nathan tells her ""Sometimes I feel like a freak like a stranger in my own life."" He keeps having the same dream about helplessly watching a woman being violently attacked. And then he and his platonic (but oh how they gaze longingly at each other) pal Karen (Collins daughter of Phil) click on that photo of the missing Lautner look-alike tyke and well lets just say Nathan and Karen never get around to finishing that class project. First-time screenwriter Shawn Christensen tries to tap into the issues teenagers hold near and dear a self-discovery alienation hormones a and layer them into an espionage thriller. Unfortunately Lautners blindingly white teeth make more of an impression. What intrigue there is comes largely from the all-star elders surrounding our squinting hero a Weaver Isaacs Maria Bello playing Nathans mom and Alfred Molina as a man trying to win Nathans trust. (Bad sign Hes a grown-up.) ""Abduction"" is just the third movie John Singleton has directed in the past decade and it contains neither the passion nor the competence of his two previous genre efforts a ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and ""Four Brothers."" Although the project makes sense for Lautner as a brand repositioning its impossible to see why Singleton signed on for this particular job-for-hire unless hes trying to make a subversive case for Team Edward. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJules Stewart wants to emerge from Twilight shadowMarch 14 2013New on DVDJanuary 15 2012Lions Gate to acquire SummitJanuary 14 20122011 Movie Preview AbductionJanuary 16 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-abduction-20110923,0,6720454.story?track=rss",200,abduction9,abduction,latimes
"Abduction review Style without substance |       NJ.com comments Abduction review Style without substance Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 23 2011 at 711 AM updated September 23 2011 at 719 AM View/Post Comments Bruce TalamonTaylor Lautner of ""Twilight"" fame with Lily Collins in ""Abduction."" Child-abduction stories are the stuff of parents nightmares. But the new ""Abduction"" comes with a twist when a teenage boy sees his own face on one of those missing-children web sites -- and realizes his parents are not his parents. And goes in search of his roots. Given that the boy is played by Taylor Lautner the slightly dazed weretoy of the ""Twilight"" series I knew he was a changeling from the start. Just judging by his abs and acting its clear hes the product of a couple of wooden washboards. But off he goes anyway -- after even before the credits are over giving us several obligatory glimpses of his bare chest. Once the youngest ""Twilight"" fans are appeased however we can focus on the drama of a teen on the run. And too bad because as an actor Lautner wouldnt even make a decent video-game avatar and the script has more than a few holes and howlers. But the direction is excellent and thats the real puzzler in this tricky little game. When he made his debut 20 years ago with ""Boyz N the Hood"" John Singleton demonstrated not only a social passion but an understanding of cinema. He was the first African-American -- and the youngest filmmaker -- ever to get a best-director nomination. Not every follow-up was perfect -- remember ""Higher Learning""? ""Poetic Justice""? -- but ""Rosewood"" was that rare historical drama that showed an oppressed people fighting back and ""Baby Boy"" was a searing study of underclass economics and familial dysfunction. And since? Well ""Shaft."" And ""Four Brothers."" And ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" And while you cant blame a director for giving up on the sort of serious movies that didnt make any money theres a feeling that a smart director has dumbed himself down. Yes he works. But theres no longer any real message to that work beyond a rappers flip forget-tha-police creed. Yet the style is still there -- focused framed forceful. So an early home-invasion scene here is full of sharp jutting angles and fast cuts; car chases are exciting without being preposterous. In the movies best sequence two men face off in a cramped train compartment (and if this isnt a deliberate nod to ""From Russia With Love"" Ill eat James Bonds briefcase). Which brings me back to the real mystery Why for his first theatrical job in six years is Singleton -- who has a busy producing career on the side -- directing this? The film has a decent budget (and hints desperately at sequels). But a Taylor Lautner teen-spy movie? Really? If Singleton is going to go commercial (""sell out"" in the words of people who never had a bill to pay) well fine. But why buy the man so cheaply? Give him a James Bond movie -- or a ""Mission Impossible"" sequel or at least a rebooted ""Bourne."" Because as glum as Lautners character is nothing in Hollywood is sadder than a talented artist an industry is using far below his or her potential. Unless its a talented artist whos grown used to it. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and teen drinking. Abduction (PG-13) Lionsgate (106 min.) Directed by John Singleton. With Taylor Lautner. Now playing in New Jersey.

Actual abduction may be preferable to the movie of the same name but only if your kidnappers dont tor ture you by forcing you to watch it. Taylor Lautner proves again he has the acting chops of Bert from ""Sesame Street."" A slight scowl is all he can muster in this junior-varsity ""Bourne Identity"" in which Lautner plays a hard-partying high school student named Nathan who discovers that his parents (Jason Isaacs and Maria Bello) arent really his own. In reality his birth father is an assassin-spy and his adoptive father an undercover CIA man gives Nathan playful (i.e. savage) kickboxing lessons to train him in case he has to go on the run. Nathan does just that when an exceptionally dim rival gang of killer spies led by Michael Nyqvist star of the original ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" comes after him. They want him on the theory that he will lead them to his dad who has a vital list of double agents. Yet he hasnt had any contact with his dad since he was a toddler so why use him as bait? Wouldnt it be easier to go after the dad directly? One assassin seems to forget whom hes after when while pointlessly trying to kill Nathans unimportant girlfriend (Lily Collins daughter of Phil) he gets so distracted that he allows Nathan himself to sneak up and beat him down. Moreover the spies plant a bomb in the oven of Nathans house and later spend many scenes shooting at him though killing him wont get them any nearer to the list of double agents. One of the strangest and most elaborate product placements Ive ever seen takes up most of the third act as everyone agrees to meet in a public place the Pittsburgh Pirates stadium (Leprosy Park or Canker Sore Field or whatever it is). In reality this place draws the kinds of crowds you could fit in a minivan. Yet in the movie the stadium is packed -- for a game against the lackluster Mets -- and the city overflows with buzzing insignia-bedizened fans of this lost and irrelevant franchise. Or maybe director John Singleton simply chose the team as a gesture toward a kindred spirit. The Pittsburgh Pirates have suffered a record 19 straight losing seasons. Singleton who started his career in 91 with two Oscar nominations for ""Boyz n the Hood"" has failed to make a single good film since that overpraised drama made him an unlikely rookie of the year.

And yes girls he does take off his shirt and expose his muscled physique rather quickly into the proceedings.Lautner best known as werewolf Jacob in the Twilight series has the physicality to star in an action thriller. But his acting range is limited. His face rarely changes expression. Perhaps his limitations were the reason for stacking the deck with a cast of pros including Michael Nyqvist star of Stieg Larssons Millennium trilogy. The seasoned actors could buttress the two leads Lautner and the even more bland Lily Collins. But actors are only as good as what theyre given to say -- and here its all cringe-worthy.The film begins with a typical high school party scene. Nathan (Lautner) drinks too much and is grounded by his parents (Bello and Isaacs). It seems like pretty typical family dynamics until Nathan stumbles on his picture on a website for abducted children. By the time he realizes his life has been a lie hes in danger for his life.It devolves into a not very suspenseful thriller in which Nathan and gal pal Karen (Collins) are on the run uncertain of whom they can trust. Can he rely on the woman he thought was his shrink (Weaver) or the CIA operative who claims to have his back (Molina)? Surely he needs to elude the troop of guys with vague Russian accents on his tail.The premise is ludicrous involving stolen state secrets. Somehow two teens manage to evade dozens of trained operatives. People close to Nathan disappear or die. But he weathers it all stoically because he has the pretty girl with him hes been crushing on since middle school.About the movieAbduction 1/2 out of fourStars Taylor Lautner Alfred Molina Sigourney Weaver Lily Collins Jason Isaacs Maria Bello Michael Nyqvist Director John SingletonDistributor LionsgateRating PG-13 for sequences of intense violence and action brief language some sexual content and teen partyingRunning time 1 hour 46 minutesOpens Friday nationwideAnd of course he gets top-notch advice ""There will be time for you to deal emotionally with all of this but right now you need to get your (act) together"" hes advised by his therapist actually a secret agent.Filled with laughable dialogue Abduction goes nowhere.

Tackling ""Twilight"" heartthrob Taylor Lautners first starring vehicle ""Abduction"" director John Singleton knows exactly what hes expected to provide The films first reel includes scenes of the star strutting shirtless winning a kickboxing match winning a wrestling match and tearing around on a motorcycle. (Auds will have to sit tight for the extended makeout scene or the cuddling in the woods with a raven-haired teenager.) Aside from such dutiful fan service the film is a haggardly slapdash ""Bourne Identity"" knockoff never rising above the level of basic competence. Lautners fans should line up in droves; other demos may go missing. Developed from a spec script by indie-rock bandleader Shawn Christensen the films plot is not without promise. Curiously groomed by his parents (Jason Isaacs Maria Bello) to be razor-sharp in the arts of self-defense Nathan (Lautner) is a good-natured all-American hotshot leading a perfect life aside from some tongue-tied reactions to girl-next-door Karen (Lily Collins) and occasional meetings with a shrink (Sigourney Weaver) to deal with his temper issues. While doing research for a school project with Karen Nathan spots a picture on a missing-children website that looks suspiciously like him as a tyke right down to the stain on his shirt. No sooner has he confronted his parents with his suspicions than theyre both rubbed out by assassins and Nathan and Lily are on the run in search of Nathans true identity while evading both a weary CIA chief (Alfred Molina) and a sinister Serbian underworld boss (Michael Nyqvist). As unoriginal as it may be this premise could have been taken in a number of directions. The notion of suddenly discovering ones parents are imposters is a disturbing one and thrusting a teenager into the world of fast cars and groovy gadgets could make for freewheeling escapism. But ""Abduction"" is as uninterested in psychological unease as it is in innovative action and simply shuffles together explosions bloodless fight scenes and incongruous romantic interludes with little regard for orchestrating tension. Most exasperating the protagonists IQs tend to dramatically rise and fall depending entirely on whether the plot requires them to gain or surrender the upper hand. At times theyre somehow smart enough to navigate tangled CIA intrigue and escape professional hitmen but at others one half expects them to pause for a skinny-dip in Crystal Lake. Lautners physique is put to the test (the martial-arts-trained actor did his own stunts) but his acting chops never get much of a workout and theres nothing here to suggest whether or not the actor can sell a film that requires him to do more than flex and smolder. Co-star Collins seems rather out of her depth however and vets like Weaver and Molina appear to be sleepwalking through. Coming six years after his decent last feature ""Four Brothers"" Singletons directorial hand betrays a bit of rust. In early pictures like ""Higher Learning"" and ""Boyz n the Hood"" the helmers high-wire pacing seemed perfectly in line with his refreshing youthful exuberance; hes now more subdued but no more polished. His cutting is quick but his staging is flat never allowing the action or the romance to develop any weight. Pittsburgh locations provide a nice change of pace even when theyre presented as aggressively as the Pirates PNC Park is at the climax. Tech specs are generally mediocre and Edward Shearmurs turgid heavy-rock score only accentuates the films straight-to-video style.

TWITTER Lily Collins Alfred Molina and Maria Bello co-star in director John Singletons far-fetched thriller about a teenager forced on the run to uncover his past. It was probably inevitable that one day there would be a Taylor Lautner film called ""Ab"" something so at the very least Abduction serves that purpose. Whatever else can be said about him the teenage star definitely gets a workout here traversing more woodsy territory in eastern America on foot than anyone since Hawkeye in The Last of the Mohicans. John Singletons action thriller has a decent sense of propulsion but after a faintly intriguing start the convoluted plot mechanics overwhelm everything else making you feel youre watching a detailed blueprint for a movie and an increasingly far-fetched one in the bargain. This Lionsgate release offers enough chases gunplay and adolescent eye candy to attract the intended audience indicating mid-range box office results. PHOTOS Abduction Red Carpet Premiere Singletons first film since Four Brothers six years ago is a straight-down-the-middle commercial outing with a hook that keeps the leading couple on the run The 39 Steps-style for most of the running time. Starting off with a drunken high school pool party the films first half-hour is layered with some off-kilter vibes When Pittsburgh school senior Nathan Harper (Lautner) wakes up hungover his macho father (Jason Isaacs) forces him into some borderline-sadistic hand-to-hand combat; Nathan oddly avoids talking to his lovely classmate Karen (Lily Collins) who lives across the street although they do make significant eye contact; he sees a shrink (Sigourney Weaver) about insomnia and rage issues and he stumbles across a Missing Kids website that features a photo of a boy missing for many years who looks exactly like he did at the time of the disappearance. PHOTOS Abduction Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins on the Run Nathan asks the woman hes always believed to be his mother (Maria Bello) if shes actually his mom but no sooner does she confess the truth than two goons in suits turn up at the front door and kill her. Tough Dad then gets done in as well while Nathan and Karen barely escape with their lives when the house blows up. VIDEO Abduction Red Carpet Premiere Immediately called by a CIA op (Alfred Molina) who urges the kid to trust him Nathan understandably feels he can do nothing of the kind. Equally suspicious is the sudden arrival of his shrink to spirit Karen and him off in her BMW while some Serbian bad guys follow in hot pursuit. Quickly informing Nathan that only four people have ever known his true identity -- his dead adoptive parents Molinas Agent Burton and herself -- the shrink dumps the teenagers on the side of the road and tells them to hurry up and get to a safe apartment that awaits them in Arlington Virginia only 250 miles away. Okay. VIDEO Abductions Taylor Lautner is Like a Young Tom Cruise Says Studio Exec Thus begins the succession of increasingly absurd plot points in Shawn Christensens screenplay which Singleton evidently believes are best dealt with by racing right past them than by trying to convincingly explain things. After tromping through the forest and hitching a ride the pair find the apartment along with some money a gun and another BMW evidently the preferred car of the CIA or perhaps of the Lionsgate product tie-in department. The couple dont know who to trust but quickly decide better the CIA than the Serbs led by the icy dead-shot Kozlow (Michael Nyqvist the capable star of the Swedish The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and its sequels here performing a decent audition to play a Bond villain). All the killing and chasing and commotion need a MacGuffin which in this instance consists of a list of CIA agents who have somehow been compromised. Why this is so important is either never made clear or gets lost in the shuffle. For his part Nathan would like to know who his real parents were; perhaps WikiLeaks will reveal their identities soon. VIDEO Abduction Taylor Lautner Gets Chased Down Shot at in New Trailer A bad sequence from which the film never recovers is a major fight scene on a train between Nathan and a Serbian thug noticeably bigger than he is. Given the paucity of hand-to-hand battles in railroad sleeping compartments in recent decades a filmmaker knows going in that such a sequence is inevitably going to be compared to the immortal struggle between Sean Connery and Robert Shaw in From Russia With Love a half-century ago. To put it kindly the comparison is not to Singletons benefit; the compartment is too big the action too slapdash the resolution far too easy. Abduction just seems silly from here through to the finale a complicated set-piece staged at Pittsburghs scenic PNC Park during an actual Pirates-Mets game last year. The sequence calls to mind the baseball climax of another early 60s thriller Blake Edwards Experiment in Terror which was shot at Candlestick Park. In the end it all feels like much ado about not much. The film lets Lautner down more than the other way around and he essentially holds his own surrounded by the sturdy likes of Weaver Molina Isaacs and Bello. Collins who made her big screen debut in The Blind Side last year and has the title role in the forthcoming Snow White has a promising offbeat appeal. Sporting strong production values the film looks spiffy.

With Lautner Lite By    Alonso Duralde on September 22 2011  205 pm Follow aduralde Email Print Related Lautners the 7.5M Teen -- but Based on What? The heartthrobs first stab at a post-""Twilight"" franchise avoids total catastrophe but at least its better than Robert Pattinsons Remember Me On paper at least ""Abduction"" seems like a story Alfred Hitchcock would have loved Its about a young man who finds out his entire life has been a lie and whos then forced to become a fugitive unable to trust either the government agents or the foreign thugs who are chasing him and the story climaxes at a crowded baseball stadium. But director John Singleton is no Alfred Hitchcock. And even if he were what would Hitchcock do with Taylor Lautner? Its too early in Lautners career to judge whether hes going to blossom from box-of-kittens-adorable teen dream to actual actor but movies as wispy as ""Abduction"" arent going to help him get there. Lautner stars as Nathan a rambunctious high-school senior whos got anger issues not to mention a recurring dream about watching a woman get abducted. His parents Kevin (Jason Isaacs) and Mara (Maria Bello) are tough but loving -- Kevin makes a hungover Nathan spar with him in the backyard and... Wait a minute -- were supposed to believe the fair-complected Isaacs and Bello gave birth to the dark Lautner? Well no. Nathan finds his picture on a missing children website only to discover that hes accidentally tipped off the Serbian mobsters whove been looking for him for years. Isaacs and Bello are CIA agents who have been protecting Nathan -- even Nathans shrink (Sigourney Weaver) is an undercover agent -- and his real dad has a list of rogue spooks (theres your Hitchcockian MacGuffin plot device) that the Serbs want. Before anyone can catch their breath the bad guys have offed Nathans adoptive parents and blown up their house and hes running from both the Serbs and CIA honcho Burton (Alfred Molina) whom Nathan doesnt entirely trust. Along for the ride is Karen (Lily Collins) the literal girl next door who proves herself to be spectacularly useless even by action-movie-chick-sidekick standards. ""Abduction"" might have worked had Singleton and screenwriter Shawn Christensen had treated this more as a teen lark but theyve decided to make the movie as ""Bourne"" as possible. And if theres one thing that Lautner cant quite pull off yet its gravitas. (His self-mocking cameo in ""Valentines Day"" was one of that films only amusing moments so playing to his comic side might well have worked.) Singleton surrounds his star with a cast of vets but its left to Lautner to be heartbroken and vengeance-driven and haunted and it all feels just a bit out of his skill set. Still the action moments pop from the big finale at a Pittsburgh Pirates game to a mano-a-mano fistfight on an Amtrak train. The latter incidentally illustrates a uniquely American brand of filmmaking that assumes everyone watching is a complete idiot -- the fight is intercut with flashbacks of Kevin teaching Nathan boxing strategy but in the very next scene Nathan has to explain to Karen ""He was preparing me all along."" Yes movie thank you we get it. Move it along. While ""Abduction"" isnt the fiasco that ""Twilight"" haters might have been eagerly awaiting its as unmemorable as they come. But at least its better than the Robert Pattinson 9/11 misfire ""Remember Me"" so Lautner can still hold his head high at the ""Breaking Dawn"" premiere party. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Taylor Lautner does all right as a teen on the run in Abduction - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Lautner keeps human form as a teen on the run in Abduction -- 2 starsSeptember 23 2011|By Roger Moore Tribune NewspapersTaylor Lautner and Lily Collins star in ""Abduction.""""Twilight"" alumnus Taylor Lautner makes his debut as a leading man in an film tailor-made for him. ""Abduction"" puts Lautner in motion and never goes wrong as long as he remains in motion.The buff teen werewolf of ""Twilight"" plays a young man who has his world upended and finds himself on the run when enemy agents attack his home and the people he knew as his parents arent who they say they are. In the opening minutes we meet Nathan (Lautner) a studly wrestler in high school constantly tested by his strict and martial dad (Jason Isaacs) nurtured by his more understanding mom (Maria Bello).If only they knew how he surfed on the hood of a pals pickup truck how he gets blotto at teen beer busts. Dad finds out and punishes the kid with mixed martial arts training. No wonder the kids in therapy.But a class project with his elusive unavailable neighbor (Lily Collins) sends them to a missing-children website. Thats where they find a photo of toddler Nathan reported as missing. And in asking about that the teens trigger an explosion of revelations about Nathans past and a desperate escape that sends boy and girl on the lam with no idea of who is after them or whom they can trust.Nathan fights and struggles to outsmart the folks chasing him Michael Nyqvist of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and Alfred Molina. And Lautner who came of age in the ""Twilight"" films struggles to make his acting as effortless as his fights. As Nathan he asks his mom ""Are you my mother?"" Compare his stone-faced asking of the question with Bellos rich warm alarmed way of playing the reaction ""You dont understand baby. Its complicated.""Director John Singleton is more concerned with the fights and chases than the human interplay between his two attractive young leads. Collins the future Snow White manages moments of pathos ""Are we going to die Nathan?""Lautner remains impassive.But the script and Singleton see to it that Molinas performance delivers a light touch and the younger players never let us lose the sense that were dealing with young people who dont know how to process all this information thats been thrown at them. Lautner seems in over his head because thats the way Nathan should react.With its violence underage drinking reckless behavior and profanity ""Abduction"" falls in the same corner of the youth market as the ""Twilight"" movies. Some moments and many lines feel cribbed from that series.And with a plot that most adults will stay a step or two ahead of ""Abduction"" isnt going to challenge anybody who has seem more than one on-the-lam picture. But Lautner doesnt embarrass himself. He may not play the tender moments like an old pro but then again neither have Arnold Sly orJason Statham.rbmooretribune.comAbduction -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of intense violence and action brief language some sexual content and teen partying)Cast Taylor Lautner (Nathan); Lily Collins (Karen); Alfred Molina (Burton); Michael Nyqvist (Kozlow) Sigourney Weaver (Dr. Bennett); Maria Bello (Mara); Jason Isaacs (Kevin)Credits Directed by John Singleton; written by Shawn Christensen; produced by Doug Davison Ellen Goldsmith-Vein Dan Lautner Roy Lee and Lee Stollman.
