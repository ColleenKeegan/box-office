And thoroughly ordinary it is too despite admittedly decent contributions from a top cast. Fleeing from an abusive boyfriend Jennifer Lopez and her daughter seek refuge in the foothills of the Rockies with ornery Robert Redford the father of her late husband whos long blamed her for the car crash which ended his sons life. In fact her arrival makes him extra ornery though he still has time to tend the wounds of old pal Morgan Freeman whos had a serious run-in with a fugitive grizzly and the presence of his granddaughter may yet bring a grudging smile. So everyone needs to move on and move on they do in exactly the way youd expect. Its beyond predictable yet not unpleasant to sit through as Hallstrom finds a comfortable ambling pace and has time for the lovely landscapes. Redfords tougher than you expect Lopez reasonable Freeman the usual. Its like a superior TV movie which suddenly wandered into cinemas.

FACT BOXAn Unfinished Life Starring Robert Redford Morgan Freeman Jennifer Lopez Becca Gardner Directed by Lasse Hallstrom Written by Mark Spragg and Virginia Spragg Studio Miramax YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Movies or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- ""An Unfinished Life"" gathered dust on a shelf at Miramax for two years before finally seeing the light of day. The belated release is understandable. Slowly paced with an extremely predictable ending the film has its faults.But if you allow yourself to be lured in the movie still manages to be both moving and poignant largely because of the superb acting cinematography and direction.Robert Redford looking every inch his age plays a grizzled Wyoming rancher Einar Gilkyson who has wallowed in bitterness since the accidental death of his son and only child.Morgan Freeman plays Mitch Bradley Gilkysons longtime friend and ranch hand. Years earlier Bradley suffered a vicious attack by a grizzly bear which left him maimed partially crippled and totally dependent upon his friend Einar. Together the two men reside on the ranch which is rapidly going to seed due to a combination of indifference and grief.Their lonely existence is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Gilkysons estranged daughter-in-law Jean (Jennifer Lopez) -- Einars sons widow -- and a granddaughter Griff (15-year-old Becca Gardner) Einar didnt even know existed.Jean Gilkyson is being physically abused by her boyfriend Gary (British actor Damian Lewis) and with great reluctance she has returned to her father-in-laws remote ranch for temporary shelter.MeanderingThings just meander along. Griff slowly integrates herself into her grandfathers life and wins his love and acceptance. Mitch who has his own demons to face helps out.Jean starts to gradually rebuild her life with the help of two local people the towns sheriff Crane Curtis (Josh Lucas) and a restaurant owner Nina (Camryn Manheim) who gives the desperate young woman a job.Then the abusive Gary suddenly shows up and the characters tentative ties are put to the test.Director Lasse Hallstrom -- who also brought us ""Chocolat"" ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape"" -- always seems to be drawn to stories dealing with dysfunctional characters in emotional crises. ""An Unfinished Life"" is no exception.Working with some longtime collaborators cinematographer Oliver Stapleton and production designer David Gropman Hallstrom has taken a script by Mark and Virginia Spragg and created a film which is moving and thoughtful -- despite its many dramatic cliches and syrupy overtones.The performers help. Theres an evident chemistry between Redford and Freeman (who worked together 25 years ago on ""Brubaker"") and Lopez gives a fine performance as the vulnerable guilt-ridden young widow and mother. Gardner is also exceptional as Griff who helps bring them all together.On paper ""An Unfinished Life"" could have been a forgettable TV movie of the week. But the excellent talent both in front of and behind the camera elevates this film to a sum greater than its parts.

Miramax Films Photo Doane Gregory An Unfinished Life rich in grim dead-ends 1 / 1 Back to Gallery An Unfinished Life Drama. Starring Robert Redford Jennifer Lopez and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Next time you fly coast to coast take a moment to look out the window and hope that the people youre flying over in the middle of the country arent quite as miserable as the folks in ""An Unfinished Life."" The movie paints a bleak picture of people getting up every morning like zombies drinking coffee and talking about the weather living in either boredom or emotional agony and enduring all in silence as though silence were cool. The big sky the big landscapes and the big mountains are there all quite impressive but in ""An Unfinished Life"" they arent images of grand possibility but crushing emblems of human smallness. People live in the shadows of imposing nature going about their business like ants anticipating the day when the ground will swallow them whole. No theres no way to talk about this movie without getting a little depressed but lets just hope that what we see here is a Left Coast distortion of life in Wyoming and leave it at that. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom ""An Unfinished Life"" is a perfectly OK drama with a good cast and many good scenes but it suffers from the usual maladies that films get when theyve been out on the ranch too long all-too-obvious symbolism and a serious case of the longueurs. It stars Robert Redford who at 68 has finally broken down and played one of those crusty old cranks that his former screen partner Paul Newman has been killing audiences with for the past 10 years. Hes Einar a weather-beaten rancher who has sold his cattle and spends his days milking cows and taking care of his old ranch hand Mitch (Morgan Freeman) who was recently mauled by a metaphor -- I mean a grizzly bear. Into the unending desolation that is Einars life comes Jennifer Lopez as Jean the wife of his late son who is on the run from her boyfriend a head case who keeps beating her up. (This is not to be confused with the head case who was beating her up in ""Enough."") Jean needs a place to hide and she brought along her daughter (Becca Gardner) Einars granddaughter whom he didnt even know existed. Hes not happy to see either of them. Related Stories VIDEO OF THE WEEK / Dont let the Unfinished metaphors maul you To his credit Redford doesnt rely on Redfordisms to play Einar. At no point does a smile of amused recognition light up his face nor is there a moment when he gets seriously outraged outspoken and reasonable. Einar starts off a crank and ends up a crank. Thus Redford remains true to the character hes playing while providing audiences with the unique experience of watching Redford and missing him at the same time. ""An Unfinished Life"" is all about the people. Though the specter of the nutty boyfriend hangs vaguely over the proceedings the movie mainly deals with things like the granddaughter coming down for breakfast and moments turn on whether grandpa will let her play in the tree house. Every day Einar helps his ranch hand dress and gives him a shot of morphine to keep his pain at bay. Hallstrom is good at making little moments register of giving them their proper importance and truth. In this sedate milieu Lopez at times looks uncomfortable even beyond the fact that shes playing an uneasy person. Much better in a relatively small role is Camryn Manheim as the gal who owns the local diner. With just a minimum of dialogue she conveys the ruefulness of an unsatisfactory life as well a certain pride self-regard and gallantry. Within 30 seconds we know her. Between watching the glacial thawing of Einars disdain and awaiting the reappearance of the nut-job boyfriend (Damian Lewis whos very good) the audience is forced to keep track of the metaphor er grizzly that mauled Mitch. At one point the metaphor gets locked up by the authorities. At another point Mitch asks Einar to take him to see the metaphor. We hear that the metaphor isnt eating and theres some talk about setting the metaphor free. The grizzly may have mauled Mitch but by the end that metaphor has mauled us. -- Advisory Domestic abuse and some untoward language.

"Over Before Its Begun washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Over Before Its Begun Robert Redford Jennifer Lopez and Morgan Freeman are in roles it seems theyve played before. (By Doane Gregory) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 9 2005 Well heres an intriguing threesome Jennifer Lopez Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman all mucking about together in the wild open country of Wyoming. The prospect of J.Lo laying it down with the Sundance Kid -- while Central Castings Wise Old Salt mutters sagely on the side -- certainly gets those anticipatory juices flowing. Unfortunately in ""An Unfinished Life"" this unusual convergence of stars doesnt amount to much. Their characters may have plausible reason to be together but the actors are too busy re-spinning their overfamiliar routines to pull you into the story. Their presence overshadows the drama so much there isnt a believable frame in the movie. After a while you even start doubting the scenery which incidentally was filmed in British Columbia. Lopez is Jean Gilkyson a single mother on the run from an abusive boyfriend (Damian Lewis). Out of money and still sporting a fist-size bruise on the side of her mouth she takes her preteen daughter Griff (Becca Gardner) on the road and heads straight for Wyoming. Thats where Einar Gilkyson (Redford) Jeans former father-in-law tends his desolate ranch. ""I have a grandfather?"" says Griff when her mother tells her where theyre heading. ""Not much of one"" says Jean. Jean and Einar we learn havent spoken since the car accident that took her husbands life some years back. Griffin was Einars beloved son and his grave sits on the hill above the ranch. Einar hasnt forgiven Jean for being the driver that day and hes never even set eyes on his granddaughter. So here they are the remnants of Einars family asking for a few weeks shelter until Jean can get a job and get her life back on track. Einar grudgingly lets them into his home where they meet Mitch (Freeman) whose face and body are disfigured from a bear mauling. Einar plies him with daily morphine shots. Everyone it seems is hurting or hating. At this point ""An Unfinished Life"" runs into a massive standstill. Its entire design lies before us in all its blaring predictability Einar and Jean will have that climactic yell-fest when they lay everything on the line all the pain and bitterness. Its a cinch too that Einar will bond with Griff whos definitely a chip off the old blocks old block. And Mitch will slyly manipulate everyone together. Mitch by the way has his own burden to bear -- or is that bear for a burden? In a subplot that has metaphor burned into it like a cattle brand the beast that attacked him now prowls behind bars at the local zoo; Mitch cant move on with his life you see until he faces the skulking bear again. Can you say ""Free Willy""? Director Lasse Hallstrom who made the wonderful ""My Life as a Dog"" ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""The Cider House Rules"" has created a Hollywood studio version of an independent movie. Its a gentle meander of a story. Its big on blue sky and lush heartland. Its characters are weighted down by grudges sorrow and character-building ennui. Unfortunately all this atmosphere is just backdrop for the posh A-listers to get some indie street cred. Lopez is playing a slight variation on the aint-gonna-take-it-no-more abusee she played in 2002s ""Enough."" As Jean she skitters amateurishly between ""Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore"" martyrdom and Jenny-From-the-Block toughness as she squares off verbally with Einar and still finds time to show Griff shes a great mom. Whenever shes onscreen ""Unfinished Life"" feels like one of those dramatic preambles to a music video. That bruise by the way seems to change shape every scene. Redfords hellbound to remain the craggy cowboy who hides his feelings under Marlboro Man stoicism. Must he act like a River Runs Through everything? In a scene whose sole purpose is to make him look tough he swings a coffeepot at two bullies who are harassing a waitress. Sure nice of those big guys to run away in ""terror"" from the Old Grump with the java. As for Freeman well youd swear he wandered over directly from the set of ""Million Dollar Baby."" Scenes in which he and Einar trade Tough Love barbs -- while Einar tends to him at his bedside -- amount to note-for-note repetitions of the quippery between Freeman and Clint Eastwood in last years Best Picture winner. An Unfinished Life (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some violence including domestic abuse and profanity.

Because director Lasse Hallstrom consciously avoids falling off that cliff into the deeply maudlin the film leaves us with a feeling of happy accomplishment. Hey they didnt ruin it is the first reaction. And then slowly we begin to appreciate a satisfying array of good performances and restrained writing gorgeous scenery and accurate portrayals of a small Western town. Hallstrom (""The Shipping News"" ""The Cider House Rules"" ""Chocolat"") believes life is inherently melancholic but he is also a sentimentalist. He thinks people can change if only slightly and that they can reclaim their future by renovating their memories of a troubling past. Luckily for Hallstrom Robert Redford was ready to reclaim his own past as a real actor when the long-delayed ""An Unfinished Life"" began filming a couple of years ago. Without Redford selling his role as a crusty hopeless rancher the movie would fall apart from the first moment. Instead Redford is a treat. He puts on Einar Gilkysons chaps one leg at a time sporting a five-day stubble creaking around in an arthritic saddle- crouch and yelling at women and children. His perfect son died years ago in a car crash stealing Einars will; this aging Wyoming cowhand gives up thriving in favor of merely surviving. Redford who has drifted through so many recent roles on his hairstyle alone here smolders with sharp eyes and a set jaw. Theres life in this old coot yet and Redford adds to the script with small telling touches. After punching a rowdy cafe customer Einar is about to walk away justice done. But he quickly whips out a hand to flick the dazed cowboys hat off part warning part exultation in still being spry enough to stop a bully. The scene set we cringe anew when Jennifer Lopez shows up. Lopez has drifted even more lazily than Redford in recent movies buffeted by media hype and her own self- promotion. But again Hallstrom makes the most of her. She channels her Big Apple resentment into a feisty battered waitress arriving at Einars ranch with a 10-year-old (Becca Gardner) in tow. Lopezs character had married Einars perfect son. Einar blames her for the death and he has never met this granddaughter now making baloney sandwiches in his messy kitchen. Please please we beg dont make this reunion sappy. Trust Hallstrom. He doesnt. ""They call them accidents because its nobodys fault"" Lopez says pleading with Einar. Unmoved for the moment he spits back ""They call them accidents to make the guilty feel better."" Now thats a chewy prospect for movie plotting. So many good things to mention Im liking the film more as I go Redfords partner on the ranch is Morgan Freeman now laid up from a bear attack. The two of them shout crankily try to say the right thing in their cowboy way and bask in each others star presence. Yes theyre close but no not that close. Hallstrom explains all in good time. If you havent been on a ranch lately recognize the small things ""An Unfinished Life"" gets right quietly creating an atmosphere in which characters can act like themselves. The cluttered houses of people preoccupied with horses a childs desire to name neglected barn cats the way a whole day gets wasted fixing something barely worth fixing. Thinking carefully about these things lets the story unfold the way it would in Wyoming instead of on a Hollywood soundstage. Perhaps it took two years of editing to complete ""An Unfinished Life."" Lets hope the worthy film is not treated as another Miramax market dump. Its a good story well told honed just short of a distracting sheen.

"Theres something missing from Unfinished - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Theres something missing from Unfinished By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 9 2005 Einar Gilkyson. Theres a name. Though not one that comes to mind when thinking about Robert Redford. Einar is a name for Max Von Sydow or Stellan Skarsgard. There are tougher hurdles for an actor but this one gives you some idea of what Redford is up against in An Unfinished Life"" How do you play an Einar? Redfords solution appears to be a little like Clint Eastwood. Oh if only.Einar runs a ranch in Wyoming. He wears cowboy hats and speaks his one-liners real slow with his jaw clenched. Hes a loner and recovering alcoholic whose exasperated wife ran off with another man. Hes the kind of guy who roughs up the punk cowboys that harass the waitress at the local diner then gives them a little speech. Einars gruff exterior gets a break when he nurses his ailing buddy Mitch (Morgan Freeman who else?) or sits and rambles aloud at the grave site of his son whos been gone more than a decade.At 68 Redford doesnt hold the screen with Eastwoods authority or charm even though this character bears more than a vague resemblance to Eastwoods recent roles. Freemans participation (hes just fine doing his trademark wise-wiseacre sidekick bit) only underscores the spirit missing in Redford. The old soul we expect Freeman to bring out of such a misanthrope never really emerges.But the movie directed by Lasse Hallstrom lacks spirit too. The locations are lovely to behold. Parts of Canada give fine performances as Wyoming so the film is scenic like a postcard and just as perfunctory. Mark Spragg and Virginia Korus Spraggs screenplay does try for familial intrigue but its all been better somewhere else.Einar gets an unwelcome visit from his estranged daughter-in-law Jean (Jennifer Lopez) and the little girl she had with his son. He hasnt seen Jean in 11 years and hes never met Griff (Becca Gardner) who is named after her late daddy. Jean is running from an abusive boyfriend (Damian Lewis) and Einar somewhat irrationally blames her for his boys death. (She was at the wheel the night he died in a crash.)Reluctantly Einar puts the two up. Eventually he bonds with the grandkid. And inevitably the violent boyfriend appears. But Jean has smartly struck up a sexual relationship with the local sheriff (Josh Lucas) and Einar owns a gun. Theres also a grizzly on the loose the very one that mauled Mitch. The film intends the bear to be some kind of metaphor for repression and later for freedom. But a moviegoer sees it howling and grunting and wonders how its the only ferocious creature in the film.An Unfinished Life"" has the ingredients for a revenge western yet none of the teeth. Were asked to find entertaining a handful of guilty people who want to be redeemed. But neither Hallstrom nor much of the cast puts much grit or conviction behind the request.Like most of Hallstroms Hollywood movies (The Cider House Rules"" Chocolat"") this one is excruciatingly tasteful. Lopez and Lucass tryst for instance is set in a car and has been shot at a depressing remove. The characters can seem private to each other but they shouldnt to us. No film containing domestic abuse a deadly grizzly fistfights curse words and this many hurt feelings should feel so polite.The movie was scheduled to come out late last year near the release of Eastwoods Million Dollar Baby"" but was held. The relationships and tone in An Unfinished Life"" are too much like that film yet not nearly enough. Quarter-million Dollar Baby"" is more like it.Why would Redford be interested in such a slow laden picture? Probably the same reason anyone would be The chance to rub Morgan Freemans back. All the movie has going for it is Griffs suspicion that Einar and Mitch might be lovers. Good try but shell have to wait until Ang Lees Brokeback Mountain"" for her dream of gay cowboys to come true. Still the girls suggestion is more convincing and more perceptive than anything else in the film. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family This Life is worth examining By Claudia Puig USA TODAY An Unfinished Life like its rural Wyoming setting is deceptively slow-paced. But like its feisty main character superbly played by Robert Redford it packs a powerful punch. Einar (Redford) cares for his land and for his injured ranch hand Mitch ( Freeman) until his estranged daughter-in-law played by Jennifer Lopez moves to the ranch. Miramax Directed by Lasse Hallstrom An Unfinished Life is an engrossing character study about estranged family members crippled by loss and hardened by guilt and resentment. Though it is an ensemble effort the film belongs to Redford and Morgan Freeman. Both are masters of subtext Redford can communicate volumes in a laconic sentence; Freeman takes cryptically philosophical lines and delivers them like profound truths. Redford plays Einar Gilkyson an old-school cowboy defined by the vast countryside and emotionally decimated by the death of his only son. Freeman is Mitch a ranch hand for decades now disabled after being mauled by a bear. Both men are scarred Freemans wounds are visible on his face and body while Redfords wracking pain is internal. Freeman has found a way to forgive but never forget. Redfords character can do neither. About the movie An Unfinished Life    (out of four) Stars Robert Redford Morgan Freeman Jennifer Lopez Josh Lucas Director Lasse Hallstrom Distributor Miramax Pictures Running time 1 hour 48 minutes Rated PG-13 for some violence including domestic abuse and language Opens nationwide Friday Into this remote setting comes Jean Einars estranged daughter-in-law played by Jennifer Lopez and her 11-year-old daughter Griff talented newcomer Becca Gardner. They are bruised souls too. Lopez is literally black and blue thanks to an abusive boyfriend; Griff is lonely and tired of putting up with her mothers string of bad guys. Jean hooks up with the town sheriff (Josh Lucas) but their romance seems oddly disjointed and thin as if some key parts ended up on the cutting-room floor. Freeman and Redford have more chemistry than these two good-looking specimens. Lopez however reveals a depth and subtlety that has not been evident since her early roles. An Unfinished Life doesnt succumb to the emotional dumbing-down that has become the norm in movies. Poignant and well-acted it offers heartfelt moments leavened by subtle humor.

"Unfinished Life An | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; unfinished-life-an ) Unfinished Life An (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Robert Redford on a horse roaming the wide-open countryside of Wyoming - doesnt sound like much of a stretch does it? What is unusual about Redfords participation in Lasse HallstrAPms An Unfinished Life is that the actor in as unkempt as he has ever appeared on screen (he looks like showed up on set after bypassing the makeup trailer). And although this touchy-feely motion picture transforms Redfords character into a human being he starts out as an unapologetic misanthrope. The tale presented in An Unfinished Life cannot be considered original. Its as familiar a piece of storytelling as youre likely to find - a physically and emotionally isolated man is revived by the introduction of two strangers into his life. With a movie like this there are no surprises. You get what you expect. Success is based on three factors. Are the characters believable and interesting? In this case yes. The small group of men and women populating An Unfinished Life transcend the stereotypes from which they spring. Is the acting solid? Again yes. There isnt a weak performance to be found. Finally does the plot contain enough interesting details to prevent it from seeming stale? There are some interesting minor elements here that allow it to avoid being a clone of every other movie of its ilk. Einar Gilkyson (Robert Redford) lives alone in rural Wyoming. His sole companion is Mitch (Morgan Freeman) a former fellow cowboy who became an invalid a year ago after being mauled by a bear. Einar cares for Mitch giving him a pain-killing shot every morning with his cup of coffee then bringing him lunch and dinner. Einars reclusive lifestyle is interrupted by the arrival of his daughter-in-law Jean (Jennifer Lopez) and granddaughter Griff (Becca Gardner). Einar isnt overjoyed to see them - he blames Jean for the death of his son 12 years ago and until now wasnt aware of his granddaughters existence. But Jean and Griff have nowhere to go - she is fleeing from a violent boyfriend Gary (Damian Lewis) and needs someplace to get her footing. On the surface the film is about Einar getting to know his beloved sons daughter. It takes some prodding from Mitch a lowering of Einars guard and a few visits to his deceased sons grave before he makes the first move but he does so. An Unfinished Life is also about Einar forgiving Jean and himself and Jean coming to grips with what happened. She admits that one of the reasons she ended up with Gary is because deep down she didnt feel she deserved better. Meanwhile Mitch must confront his demons in a concrete way. Redford finally acting his age doesnt try to be a romantic lead. Released from the constraints of having to be handsome to win a woman he turns in an affecting performance as a man whose life ended with his sons. Morgan Freeman reminds us that there are few better character actors working today. Newcomer Becca Gardner shows no hints of awkwardness - shes a natural. And for the first time in years Jennifer Lopez throws off the superstar cloak and gets back to basics. This is the best performance she has given since The Cell and it recalls her early career before she became a paparazzi darling. (One wonders if she did this film with its opportunity to collaborate with a respected director like HallstrAPm in an attempt to rehabilitate her tarnished reputation as a thespian. Like Ben Affleck she is still suffering from the fallout of her year of overexposure.) An Unfinished Life is a study of emotions and characters; its deliberate and unhurried. The director has an obvious affinity for individuals trapped in stasis - many of his best films focus on them. This movie will appeal to a specific audience - those who care more about spending time with three-dimensional characters than following a convoluted plot or getting an adrenaline kick. An Unfinished Life isnt original but for those who enjoy this sort of drama its an opportunity to remember how in the right circumstances on-screen characters can touch our hearts.

A film is in trouble when despite the presence of an A-list cast and a well-regarded director the best thing in it is a bear. After two years on the shelf Lasse Hallstroms ""An Unfinished Life"" emerges as a cliched meller about the tense reunion between a Wyoming rancher (Robert Redford) and his long-lost kin. Most of the films above-the-liners seem to be retracing old steps creating a somnambulant atmosphere. Part of Miramaxs celluloid mountain of unreleased fodder due to bow this autumn pic can only hope to appeal to a blockbuster-weary older demographic and escape critical mauling. In Ishawooa Wyo. former alcoholic farmer Einar Gilkyson (Redford) takes care of his few remaining animals and his best friend Mitch (Morgan Freeman) a former ranch hand who suffered terrible injuries after being attacked by a bear. The two get by on stoicism for Einar morphine for Mitch and mutually sustaining old mens banter. The spreads delicate emotional ecosystem is suddenly upset by the arrival of Jean Gilkyson (Jennifer Lopez) Einars errant daughter-in-law who ran off pregnant 12-odd years ago after Einars son Griffin the ""unfinished life"" of the title was killed in a car crash. Jean had been driving and Einar never forgave her. Since then Jean has been dragging her 11-year-old daughter Griff (newcomer Becca Gardner) around the country. Her latest boyfriend Gary (Freemans ""Dreamcatcher"" co-star Damian Lewis) hit her one too many times hence her trek to the old homestead. The drawn-out middle act observes this newly formed family as they tentatively establish bonds particularly between young Griff her gruff granddad and his friend whom in the pics funniest scene she assumes is his gay lover. Jean gets a job as a waitress in the towns only restaurant working alongside good broad Nina (Camryn Manheim) and starts knocking boots with local sheriff Crane (Josh Lucas) after warning him to look out for her ex Gary. Sure enough two ferocious creatures resurface. The bear that mauled Mitch is captured and stuck in a makeshift zoo. Meanwhile Gary starts skulking round the ranchs edge smoking cigarettes to signal his irredeemable nature. When Einar escorts Gary out of town at gunpoint Gary sneers ""Youve seen too many Westerns old man"" to which Einar retorts ""That doesnt exactly work in your favor."" But then again Gary has a point. Viewers will have seen too much of all this for it to feel fresh; too many better modern Westerns lauding down-home values; too many pics where a liberated animal is the symbol of redemption; too many Lasse Hallstrom middle-brow tales about misshapen or outcast folk who form makeshift families (""The Cider House Rules"" ""The Shipping News"" ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape""); and one too many stories where Redford co-stars with a bear (""Jeremiah Johnson"") and J-Lo struggles to regain audience sympathy by playing a victim of abuse (""Enough"") with perfectly coiffed hair and a decorative bruise that color-coordinates with her wardrobe. Thesping is not up to the usual Hallstrom standard. Redford who seems to be putting his own laconic spin on a part that feels like it was written for Clint Eastwood doesnt muster anything much more than dignity and manly grumpiness but at least he can really throw a lasso. Meanwhile Freeman is as he was in ""Million Dollar Baby"" the pics tragedy-worn Jiminy Cricket looking noble in adversity and uttering wise advice from his sickbed. Young Gardner has a tough tenderness and she brings out the best in her older male co-stars. Lopezs perf however is strictly one-note. Editing seems designed to disguise her weaknesses by reducing her role to a number of backlit closeups that let her look pretty. In what should be her biggest scene -- a fight with Einar about her husbands death -- the camera offers mostly closeups of Redford reacting as she shouts at him from offscreen. All in all ursine thesp Bart the bear offers the most memorable turn of the lot. Mark Spraggs tidy adaptation of his novel collaborating with Virginia Korus Spragg pushes didactic forgiveness and family-values themes for all theyre worth in the last act which may get soft-hearted viewers sobbing. Still Hallstrom dawdles over tying up loose ends and the pacing feels maple-syrup slow. Best element out of the generally pro but decidedly average tech package is the typically rich honey-hued lensing by regular Hallstrom collaborator Oliver Stapleton. Use of widescreen does ample justice to breathtaking British Columbia locations. Score by Christopher Young is mawkish.
