Comments Eight Millimeter Nicolas Cage plays a ""surveillance specialist"" hired to determine whether a snuff film found in the safe of a recently deceased Pennsylvania millionaire is authentic--a job that leads him into the seamier recesses of the porn industry on both coasts. The director of this creepy wide-screen thriller is Joel Schumacher who will surely live in infamy for Batman and Robin; he seems much more in charge this time maybe because he has something to work with. The sturdy script is by Andrew Kevin Walker the former Tower Records cashier who also wrote Seven and theres a similar impulse here to rub our noses in terminal slime and evil. The desire for retribution thats honored so unambiguously may be morally based but its the morality of Mickey Spillane and I wonder if the defense of vigilante justice in Schumachers earlier A Time to Kill is more than just a coincidence. I cant say I warmed to the results but I was solidly held for the films two hours and the secondary cast--including Joaquin Phoenix Peter Stormare Amy Morton and James Gandolfini--is unusually sharp; with Catherine Keener Anthony Heald and Chris Bauer.

""8MM"" is a movie that keeps jumping the gate and finally unravels all over the floor. A murky melange of borrowings from far superior pix like ""Seven"" ""Hardcore"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" this overly dark and often gratuitously nasty film about a PI investigating the source of a supposed ""snuff movie"" raises issues it later junks in favor of mainstream thrills and is toplined by a perf from Nicolas Cage that isnt up to the job. With direction from Joel Schumacher that swings abruptly from faux modern noir to regulation Hollywood thriller this looks like a tough sled in the domestic marketplace for Sony which chose to preem the movie at the Berlin fest -- perhaps wisely as foreign looks to contribute a sizable portion of whatever money it makes. Buffs expecting another stygian psychothriller from scripter Andrew Kevin Walker (""Seven"") are going to be massively disappointed. Walkers latest effort is frequently simplistic in its emotions and far more routine in structure Though his theme is again Evil with a capital E ""8MM"" has none of his previous works clammy tension or gut-curdling moments. After initial curiosity general auds are likely to be turned off by the coldly manipulated content which certainly pushes the envelope for a major studio production. Cage plays Tom Welles a surveillance specialist who lives a comfortable existence in Harrisburg Pa. and is well regarded in his profession but is still waiting for his break into the big time. A family man whose work keeps him away from home too often for the likes of his wife Amy (Catherine Keener) hes hired by Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) widow of the states richest businessman to discover the identity of a teenage girl seemingly murdered by a masked man in an 8mm movie she found in her late husbands private safe. Opening reels are promising with the pic settling into tightly-constructed procedural mode as the methodical businesslike Welles who believes ""snuff movies"" are a modern myth treats the big-bucks assignment as a missing-persons case that will pay for his baby daughters future education. Establishing by way of the films stock that it was made some six or seven years earlier Welles finally identifies the girl as Mary Anne Mathews who has been missing since 93. The trail leads to her mother Janet (Amy Morton) and thence to L.A. where Mary Anne went in search of fame and fortune in the movies. Checking out Hollywoods adult bookstores Welles makes the acquaintance of porn shop owner Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) who he hires to guide him through L.A.s hard-core Samp;M movie scene. Phoenixs louche quipping performance brings a welcome touch of humor to the picture as it enters ""hard-core"" territory with brief but surprisingly graphic glimpses of the product Welles views to find clues to Mary Annes history. Welles finally gets a major break that leads him to porno moviemaker Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) who clearly recognizes the girls picture and then to New York Samp;M specialist Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare). More and more convinced that Mary Anne actually died in the movie Welles hires Velvet to make a movie of his prescription on condition that he can attend the shooting and meet Dinos star performer the leather-masked Machine (Chris Bauer). Its here 75 minutes in that the movie suddenly jumps the rails after its lengthy setup. For no convincing reason the script perfunctorily dumps Phoenixs character and leaves Cage whose performance to this point could most kindly be described as one-dimensional to carry the movie forward. From this point on it largely settles into a tenebrous action-thriller with a villain suddenly unmasked in the woodpile Cage and his family imperiled and a final couple of reels in which both Walkers script and Schumachers direction careen all over the commercial highway. Whereas Paul Schraders ""Hardcore"" was fueled by a parents moral indignation at the discovery of his daughters descent into iniquity ""8MM"" has a central figure whose growing anger at the trade hes investigating is due more to his indecision over whether he should step away from the job and forfeit a large check. Sidestepping any real examination of Welles conflicts the script simply settles for a remark from Max ""You dance with the devil the devil doesnt change. The devil changes you."" Right. As Welles Cage simply doesnt have the range to beef up an underwritten part which changes from buttoned-down professional to screaming moral avenger in the space of a reel. Phoenixs Max the only shaded character in the film and the only thesp with whom Cage establishes any kind of chemistry is a severe loss at the two-thirds point from which the picture never recovers. Gandolfini and Stormare are routine as the pornographers with the latter over-acting badly and Keener whose presence throughout the movie is mostly at the other end of a phone to Cage is undercut by a role that veers from kissy-kissy wife to irritating grouch. Far better is Morton in a quietly affecting perf as the missing girls mother. Sole touch of real class is provided by vet Carter as Christians restrained dignified widow. As would be expected from a Schumacher production the crew mostly delivers on the technical side with Robert Elswits widescreen lensing always well composed and Gary Wissners production design packed with detail. Sole lapse is Mychael Dannas score which is as eccentric in tone as the movie it accompanies. 8mmProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures presentation of a Hofflund/Polone production.

Summoned by wealthy widow Mrs Christian and her lawyer (Heald) ambitious PI Tom Welles (Cage) is asked to establish whether the 8mm snuff movie found in the dead husbands safe is real or fake. This starts like a hetero reprise of Cruising with Welles neglecting wife and child to immerse himself in LAs porno underworld guided by Max (Phoenix) an assistant in an adult bookshop. Once he homes in on the film-makers however the emphasis shifts from challenging ambivalence to the crudest knee-jerk vigilantism. And by the time we get to the climactic confrontation with masked sadist Machine its clear that whereas Walkers collaboration with David Fincher on Seven was a successful meeting of minds 8MM was born out of a serious clash of sensibilities. Theres no faulting Cages committed intense performance but his slide from professional internalised concern into personal self-righteous rage still leaves a nasty aftertaste.DVD InfoAspect Ratio 2.35 Wide ScreenSound Source Dolby Digital 5.1 SurroundSpecial Features Directors Commentary / Deleted Scenes / Filmography / TrailerMain Language English By NF Details Release details Duration 123 mins Cast and crew Director Joel Schumacher Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker Cast Nicolas CageJoaquin PhoenixJames GandolfiniPeter StormareAnthony HealdChris BauerCatherine KeenerMyra Carter Users say LiveReviews|01 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/63751/8mm.html,200,8mm2,8mm,timeout

But when we first meet him in Eight Millimeter hes a colorless self-employed taxpayer leading a drab existence in Harrisburg Pa. drabber than that -- as depicted -- one cannot get without re- locating to Bulgaria. Welles has a wife (Catherine Keener from Your Friends amp; Neighbors) who doesnt smile much possibly because her husband is as impenetrable as Gore-Tex. And hes got an infant daughter Cindy whom he affectionately calls Cinderella hugs for 20 seconds then returns to her mothers arms. When the man really wants to bust loose he secretly smokes a forbidden cigarette then lies to his wife about the source of the reek that wreathes him. Welles life becomes considerably more exciting when hes hired by a wealthy old widow (Myra Carter). Shes upset because among the contents of her late husbands private safe she has found a reel of 8 mm film featuring a young woman who one could swear is being slashed to death. Its a snuff film. And what the horrified widow wants the private eye to find out is Who is the girl? And was the mutilation staged -- or was she really murdered? Eight Millimeter a thriller as shredded to a pulp as the poor victim on Welles ""To Find"" list is the post-Batman amp; Robinn project of Joel Schumacher and it retains the directors trademark lascivious ogling camouflaged as lavish attention to art direction; the script is by Sevens Andrew Kevin Walker and retains that stylistically influential 1995 thrillers undiscriminating fascination with depravity. (The intrusive music by Mychael Danna suggests that every time depravity is uncovered sitars twang and Sufis wail.) Following the trail of the unknown girl Welles makes his way to L.A. where he decends into the skeevy depths of the towns fetish-movie industry and the unlikely Dante meets an even more unlikely Virgil to guide him through the dark woods of taboo. Wannabe rock star Max (Joaquin Phoenix) an adult- bookstore clerk is the kind of indulgently constructed movie character -- a young actors dream -- whos so quirk bedecked he furtively reads In Cold Blood wrapped in a dirty book so as not to attract shocked stares on the job. Max is hip and articulate; hes also amazingly well connected. And he takes his new friend on a tour of his turf where the fathomless voraciousness of human appetites threatens to alienate Welles from his own ""decent"" self. (As a reminder of how even a runaway-turned-porn victim is somebodys daughter -- a message previously posted by Paul Schrader in Hardcore -- the absent father regularly fills the silences that hang heavy in the phone calls to his neglected wife with ""Hows Cindy?"") Eight Millimeter hammers home these debatable if old-news notions -- that savage tastes live in average people ready to be awakened with the right stimulus and that those who watch porn (and by extension those who are excited by this provocative movie about porn) are in some way complicit in the inevitable proliferation of porn -- with all the subtlety of Dirk Digglers appendage. And then as Welles moves on to rough-and-seedy New York City in pursuit of a skanky producer (James Gandolfini powerful star of HBOs The Sopranos) and insinuates himself into the goth lair of a satanic director of Samp;M movies (Fargos Peter Stormare as understated as Marilyn Manson) the movie devolves further; it becomes a pointless violent torture-or-be-tortured flick in which the detective supposedly wrestles with his own most dehumanized instincts. You can tell Cage is wrestling because his face collapses inward with private pain even more than usual. Nows the time for him to drawl Con Air style ""Put. The. Bunny. Down."" In one suspenseful scene Welles tracks a particularly brutal sexual sadist to the guys home. Of course the beast lives with his mama in the mildest of Queens neighborhoods right next to a cemetery. Of course the unseen mother can be heard imploring ""Come to church son"" before trundling off to the Faithful Christian Fellowship. Of course its nighttime and the skies weep raindrops and the filmmaker cant resist including a shot of a wet Virgin Mary lawn ornament. Pornography next to godliness -- its all the same to Schumacher a heavenly opportunity to art-direct an unconvincing notion of hell.

"8MM (R) Related Item ""8MM"" showtimes Natural Porn Killers By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 26 1999 Nicolas Cage left seeks out scuzz and filth and Peter Stormare in ""8MM."" (Columbia TriStar) Director Joel Schumacher Cast Nicolas Cage; Joaquin Phoenix; Peter Stormare; James Gandolfini; Catherine Keener Running Time 2 hours 5 minutes Contains disturbing pornography obscenity and violence In the uncertain zone between dumb and truly twisted lies ""8MM"" a movie that will baffle and disgust you in one disconcerting experience. Director Joel Schumachers thriller about snuff pornography feels like a misplaced excuse to make a dark trip to a scuzzy underworld and express moral outrage at the potbellied pigs who create and support such an industry. And if in passing he has to show you flashes of women being beaten degraded and possibly killed thats par for the course. That Nicolas Cage agreed to star in this project is one of the movies more unintended mysteries. Perhaps he thought screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walkers ""8"" would be as good as his ""Seven."" Cages presence is workmanlike and watchable enough to make you sit through most of the movie. But as the movies gratuitous agenda begins to smell too obvious and it becomes clear this things a disaster Cages credibility goes to seed. Youre almost tempted to wait outside his front door with a camera crew harsh lights and the inevitable question ""Why Nicolas? Why?"" As surveillance expert Tom Welles hes hired by the elderly widow of a deceased millionaire to make sense of a disturbing Super-8mm movie found among the dead mans personal effects. The ""snuff movie"" shows a young lady apparently being raped and killed by a large man wearing a leather face mask whose name we learn later is Machine. Mrs. Christian the old lady wants Tom to find out who made this movie and whether the girl is truly dead. ""Please find her alive"" says Mrs. Christian. Tom kisses his wife Amy (Catherine Keener) and baby daughter goodbye and goes in search of scuzz and filth. He finds it in Hollywoods underworld of pornography. He meets - and heres the best part of the movie - an interesting character called Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) a rock star aspirant who earns money clerking in a porno store. As Tom closes in on his target which includes finding a snuffmeister dubiously known as ""The Jim Jarmusch of Samp;M"" Max brings much-needed comic relief to this dark little thriller. When Tom and Max notice a porno actress appearing in one snuff film after apparently dying in a previous one Max retorts ""Oh thats great Snuff 2 The Resurrection"" But Walkers script also insists on making Max prattle on about the contagious influence of pornography. ""Before you know it"" he warns Tom ""youre dancing with the devil."" And then who knows Tom? Youll probably start watching professional wrestling In the past director Schumachers darkest moments have been couched in campy quotation marks as evidenced in two Batman movies and the music-video-flavored ""Flatliners."" But this time he goes for broke with ultra violence gross sexual acts and an eastern-flavored music score presumably intended to underscore this disorienting atmosphere. Without giving things away lets just say that things get increasingly ugly and diabolical. And Tom getting predictably soiled by the world hes infiltrating becomes increasingly vigilante in spirit as he faces off with the worst the underground porno empire has to offer. One feels pity for the poor souls who appear in these porn flicks of course. But the real female victim in ""8MM"" is actress Keener in the thankless role of Toms wife. Theres one unintentionally hilarious moment when Tom - covered in blood facing the end and fearful his family might be in danger - calls his wife and tells her to get the hell out of the house with the kid and hide out until he sends for her. At this point she dithers with a whine. ""What are you saying Tom? Youre really starting to scare me."" Or words to that effect. At this point the movie breaks down completely. But the story still has a long way to go.

The good news is that Warner Brothers came to its senses and put the new ""Superman"" film on hold. Nicolas Cage as the man of steel? What were they thinking? That left Cage free for another project. More good news The ""Batman"" franchise is also on hold -- there is a higher power -- which frees up director Joel Schumacher. The bad news? Freed from their other projects the pair decided to make ""Eight Millimeter."" MULTIMEDIA Pauls Pix ""Eight Millimeter"" Windows Media 28K 80K Theatrical preview for ""Eight Millimeter"" Real 28K 80K Windows Media 28K 80K Cage plays a mild-mannered everyman who happens to be a private eye or in this case a ""surveillance specialist"" named Tom Welles. Welles is balancing life between work and his family -- a wife played woodenly by Catherine Keener and an infant daughter. But when hes hired by a billionaires widow who found an 8mm so-called ""snuff film"" in her dead husbands safe his life is turned upside-down. She wants him to find out if the film is real and if the girl ""murdered"" in the movie is really dead. (Snuff films which the FBI and pornographers themselves say are urban myths are movies in which someone is actually killed in cold blood on camera.) Of course in this case the film is very real and the girl is really dead. Otherwise thered be no movie. Now our hero becomes obsessed with finding the killers of this girl hes never met and stopping them before they can ""snuff"" again. Unofficial sleaze guide Welles starts his investigation by trying to uncover the identity of the girl. This leads him to Hollywood (of course) and a tour of the underground world of hard-core pornography. Along the way he joins forces with Max a porn shop clerk and unofficial tour guide to sleaze (now wouldnt that be a nice addition to the Universal Studios tour?). ALSO Interview Cage takes risky role in Eight Millimeter As Max Joaquin Phoenix adds a nice element of black humor to the film. He serves up lines such as ""You name the vice Ill name the price"" and ""There are only three rules in life. Number one there is always a victim number two dont be the victim and I forget number three."" For the first half-hour or so this film actually works fairly well. Then it proceeds to fall apart in big chunks. Schumacher who began his career as a department store window dresser continues to have a wonderful eye for detail and a fantastic visual sensibility that make his movies unique. Maybe if you turned off the sound and just looked at the pictures it would be a better movie. But he gets way too caught up in using symbolism to the point where it gets a little silly. For example Welles has to walk through a meat market to get to where the porn movies are shot -- we get it Joel. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker who brought us the film ""Seven"" (another creepy dark film) has crafted a muddled script that occasionally slips into the realm of ""say what?"" Theres one place in the movie where the dialogue and the situation are so ludicrous they elicited a unified groan from my fellow audience members. But the major reason this film ultimately fails is miscasting. Cages character is an average joe who is pulled into this horrifying world. Cage can play many things but average joe isnt one of them. Cage was born with an edge a mile wide. I would love to see what Tom Hanks or even Kevin Costner would do with this role. ""Eight Millimeter"" wants to be both an edgy dark film about a forbidden subject and at the same time a big glossy commercial Hollywood production. Its a little bit of both and a whole lot of neither. Schumacher had told press types that he cut substantial pieces of this movie out to keep it from getting an NC-17 rating. ""Eight Millimeter"" is rated R with a running time of 126 minutes.

Starring Nicolas Cage Joaquin Phoenix and Peter Stormare. Directed by Joel Schumacher. (R. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The snickers begin about 20 minutes before the dreadful new Joel Schumacher thriller ""8MM"" lamely ends -- commits suicide? -- after more than two hours. The snickers turn into hoots derisive laughter and finally stupefied silence. The audience is listening all right and isnt going to take it sitting down. Audiences certainly the one at Wednesday nights preview at the AMC Galaxy are smarter than the filmmakers. They know when theyre being treated with contempt. It isnt the subject matter alone -- snuff films -- that is the problem. In one of lifes little coincidences an infinitely better film about a killer who films his dying victims Michael Powells now-classic ""Peeping Tom"" also opens today at the Castro Theatre. Oddly enough ""8MM"" begins very well as a nouveau noir. Cage as private detective Tom Welles is hired by a dowager who has discovered a one-of-a-kind 8mm snuff film among her late husbands belongings. She wants to know if the girl who is apparently killed in course of the privately made Samp;M porno reel is still alive. Welles shown as a devoted family man is a secret smoker. He lies about his smoking to his wife who can smell the truth and as he begins his investigation we see it is merely in keeping with the long string of lies his work requires. He views the snuff film and at first we are shown more of his appalled reaction than of the film itself though as ""8MM"" progresses we see more and more of it and clues to the mystery start to pile up. As he is drawn into the world of underground porno he begins like a newspaper reporter to look like and take on the characteristics of the people he is covering. Is he lying to himself as well and is his moral outrage a cover for his secret fascination with lowlife? Joaquin Phoenix as a porno store clerk named Max is the best of what starts out as an interesting gallery of lowlife characterizations. He has a haircut that gives him horns and a body shirt that makes him look as if hes got an elaborate Masami Teraoka tattoo. Welles hires Max to lead him through the porno underworld but Max has got his number. ""Are you getting turned on by this?"" he asks. So far so good. The puritan with a dark side is a familiar figure in life and in movies even though the audience might begin wondering if ""8MM"" is going to give credit to William Friedkin for stealing the plot of ""Cruising"" the far better and unfairly maligned film starring Al Pacino. It is when ""8MM"" goes from noir to a weird orgy of mayhem and self-righteousness that things become ludicrous. Cage and Phoenix have a showdown with the heavies in which they become the subjects of a snuff film. It involves bondage knives handcuffs and even more absurdly a crossbow. Peter Stormare plays porn director Dino Velvet and apparently in some sort of bizarre in-joke seems to be made up to resemble ""Titanic"" director James Cameron. Welles even flatters Velvet in a parody of a wacko film critic ""The subliminal imagery really gets under your skin."" Stormare (""Fargo"") goes in and out of some outlandish accent and if he doesnt exactly chew the scenery at one point he does chew the props. James Gandolfini (from the HBO series ""The Sopranos"") as front man for Velvet is required to deliver a speech of such screen-deadening nonsense that its almost amazing when later a leather-clad Samp;M master is unmasked and comes up with an even more ridiculous one. Poor Catherine Keener as Welles wife must play most of her scenes with a telephone at her ear and a baby on her arm but when she finally explodes it seems merely the beginning of the excesses that follow. Cage plays a crescendo on the theme of moral outrage until it reaches eye-bulging proportions. This self-righteous indignation with which the audience is asked to identify is merely self-indulgent. The idea of snuff films is presented as so obnoxious that it disgusts even the slimiest porn peddlers. This doesnt stop Schumacher from teasing us with one nor does it stop there. ""8MM"" voyeuristically wallows in the sadistic violence it professes to deplore.
