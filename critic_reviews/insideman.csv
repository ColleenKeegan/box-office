Comments Inside Man Recommended ""Weve all seen Dog Day Afternoon"" hostage negotiator Denzel Washington tells bank robber Clive Owen in this wily thriller which revitalizes a familiar premise by turning it inside out. Owen and his crew clad in boilersuits and sunglasses seize a Manhattan bank and barricade themselves inside with a couple dozen patrons and employees; Washington gets the upper hand only after he realizes Owens too smart to have painted himself into a corner accidentally. In the last half hour the plot twists begin to subside and the thematic paucity becomes harder to overlook but this is still a superior nail-biter. Spike Lee directed a debut script by Russell Gewirtz; with Jodie Foster Chiwetel Ejiofor Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer. R 129 min. By J.R.

""Inside Man"" a bank-heist thriller with a tricky nothing-is-as-it-seems playfulness is the kind of solid mass-appeal entertainment that Hollywood is supposed to knock out in its sleep but rarely pulls off even when wide awake. As unexpected as some of its plot twists is the fact that this unapologetic genre movie was directed by Spike Lee who has never sold himself as Mr. Entertainment. But here it is a Spike Lee joint thats downright fun.""Inside Man"" was written by first-timer Russell Gewirtz and though it has its share of holes that become visible when all the dust settles it keeps you in a state of cheerful suspense while its unfolding. The question this robbery movie raises is not your standard ""Whodunit?"" nor even ""How did he do it?"" nor even really ""Will he get away with it?"" Its something a little more unusual ""What the hell is he up to?""The he in question is Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) a cool very smart customer who informs us from his cell at the start of the movie that he has planned the perfect crime. With a team disguised as industrial painters he storms a downtown New York bank takes everyone hostage knocks out the cameras and informs the two hostage negotiators--Denzel Washingtons Det. Keith Frazier and his partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor)--that a jet must be delivered for his escape. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Seems straightforward but whats he gonna do with a jet and doesnt he know nobody ever gets a plane in a bank-robbery negotiation? And why is he making his hostages strip and having them dress like his co-conspirators making it impossible to tell whos a captor and whos a captive? And why is the venerable head of the bank (a fine but predictably cast Christopher Plummer) so concerned about the contents of his safety-deposit box that he enlists the citys most ferociously well-connected Ms. Fix-it (a deliciously coldblooded Jodie Foster) to see that nobody knows anything about it?Theres a good reason Lee was hired for this job his deep-rooted sense of the New York melting pot. What keeps ""Inside Man"" from becoming just another standard crime drama is its willingness to digress to become a kind of sociological comedy of manners. The digressions far from dissipating the tension add to it the criminal mastermind is using diversions to keep Washington and the cops guessing much as the moviemakers use them to keep us guessing. Theres a funny interlude where the detectives try to discover what language is being spoken on a tape by the thieves which leads to a wonderful cameo by a foxy Albani-an whos willing to translate if she can get her parking tickets fixed. Lee is alert to the rage of the Sikh bank worker whos sick of being mistaken for an Arab to the power struggles between Washingtons second-tier detective and Willem Dafoes police captain to the irony of Owens crook being shocked by the ultraviolent racist videogame a young black Brooklyn boy is playing. The movie crackles with the serio-comic tension of thin-skinned New Yorkers thrown together in a crisis. The three stars are in top form and theyre backed up by a big motley supporting cast that jostles and kvetches and bargains and explodes with all the juiciness youd expect from a Big Apple crowd on a dog day afternoon.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The set-up seems to offer an explanation four robbers enter a Manhattan bank and instigate a lock-down with military precision taking hostage several dozen staff and customers. A cross-section of the city in mortal peril in a fortress of capital - what better vessel than this microcosmic pressure cooker for one of Lees excavations of racial and economic tensions in contemporary New York? But no. What follows is neither indictment nor satire but a slick kinetic and relatively straightforward - which is to say enjoyably twisty-turny - tranche of cat-and-mouse procedural. And given Lees decidedly mixed recent output (She Hate Me 25th Hour) thats no bad thing. The face-off is between hostage negotiator Frazier (Denzel Washington noble as usual but affable and short on pomposity) and unflappable lead robber Dalton (Clive Owen remarkably compelling given that his motivation and face are concealed for most of the movie). Russell Gewirtzs screenplay offers no surprises but its satisfyingly head-scratchy throughout from its choppy chronology to the ambiguous roles of supercool fixer Jodie Foster (unusually perky) and bank boss Christopher Plummer (usually reptilian). The narrative ducking and diving leaves room for a few Lee-style asides - a Sikh complains of chronic harassment - but nothing that adds up to a social argument. Like Dalton Lee executes his mission with aplomb even if his motivation remains a little less clear.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Theres something inside he wants and hes gotta have it. 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Inside Man Thriller. Starring Denzel Washington Clive Owen Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer. Directed by Spike Lee. (R. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yes theres a hostage situation in ""Inside Man"" but thank goodness it doesnt rely on that tired plot device for kicks. The thrills in Spike Lees singularly savvy thriller are in small unexpected moments -- such as Denzel Washingtons detective stopping to put on a rakish straw hat and adjust the brim in a police station mirror before heading off to a bank heist to negotiate a hostage standoff or a little run of a trumpet as the camera scans an architecturally grand 1920s financial institution from left to right for evidence of the robbers malfeasance. When Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) finally confronts the main perp Dalton Russell (Clive Owen in a full-face mask a huge disappointment for anyone who likes looking at him and who doesnt?) he warns the bad guy that this isnt going to turn out well and asks if hes seen ""Dog Day Afternoon."" While both take full advantage of their New York setting -- Lee begins with a virtual tour of the skyline shot from odd angles -- ""Inside Man"" is more like the anti-""Dog Day"" a film in which the crooks outthink the cops on every move. Russell Gewirtzs smart script amazingly the first hes written outthinks the audience as well. Gewirtz takes the conventional format of a heist flick and does something completely unorthodox with it. Not until an ending I defy anyone to predict does it even become clear what the Dalton gang came to steal. Amid the commotion of police trailers and bystanders gathered for cheap thrills an exceedingly cool power broker named Madeline White (Jodie Foster) appears to do her own negotiating with Dalton. (These monikers have to be an in-joke considering the existence of infamous 19th century bank robbers named Dalton and that the blond and porcelain-skinned Foster wears a preponderance of white.) ""Inside Man"" has little of the hyped-up urgency to extricate innocent people involving cops screeching out orders typical of the genre. Instead the title tips you off that not all the 50 or so hostages may be innocent. To confuse the situation Dalton immediately has them put on skin-tight masks and overalls identical to his gangs. Its a great visual to see everyone scurrying around the august bank interior looking like pod people. As hostages are slowly released Detective Frazier considers the possibility they could be accomplices while grilling them. Because theyre a mix of races this allows for a little lesson on racism in America. It wouldnt be a Spike Lee movie without some lecturing but at least its done here with humor. When one hostage who proudly identifies himself as a Sikh complains about being stopped at airports for so-called random searches Frazier counters with ""Yeah but you can always get a cab."" The interrogation scenes are shot in sepia tones and focus on close-ups of Washington whos ready for them. Maybe because this is his fourth collaboration with Lee Washington seems completely at ease in front of the camera. His dazzling smile and way of sauntering -- he moves with more grace than any actor around -- are in full evidence. Best of all hes been given a girlfriend he gets to talk dirty to exhibiting a sexual side rarely seen on screen. It takes nothing away from Owens and Fosters performances to say that Washington dominates the movie. His character is more fully developed than the others. Owen is mesmerizing breaking through the fourth wall to enumerate for the audience the who what and why of the crime hes about to commit but then he disappears behind that darn mask. Whites exact occupation is intentionally left vague and Foster appropriately plays her with an air of mystery. Whatever function White performs shes the one whos called when the founder of the bank being robbed (Christopher Plummer exuding the haughtiness of the super rich) needs assurance that the contents of the security box he keeps there wont be disturbed. As much as anything ""Inside Man"" is a treatise on power. The banker has it and uses it to intimidate White who in turn attempts to let Frazier know shes on top. But as the movie cleverly shows you dont need a title in front of your name or a load of money to attain power. All you need is something that someone else wants. When the bank is bugged and the robbers are heard speaking Albanian the police are in desperate need of a translator. The former wife of a bystander is recruited. She comes in carrying a bagful of parking tickets that she expects to be fixed and immediately lights up a cigarette. Told theres no smoking she just laughs. The movie isnt without plot holes and Lees pacing especially at the beginning is awfully slow. But those are the sorts of things that nag at you when a film doesnt have much to offer. ""Inside Man"" has an abundance of riches. -- Advisory This film contains violence obscene language and mild sexuality.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Inside Man"" with Denzel Washington Clive Owen Jodie Foster Chiwetel Ejiofor Willem Dafoe Christopher Plummer. Directed by Spike Lee from a screenplay by Russell Gewirtz. 129 minutes. Rated R for language and some violent images. Several theaters. Spike Lees uneven but engrossing crime thriller ""Inside Man"" goes straight for the punch. An elegant Manhattan bank filled with midday customers is entered by four people in white painters coveralls with scarves and sunglasses concealing their faces. With a well-rehearsed efficiency they disarm the security cameras seal the doors order the customers to the floor and just like that the bank is under siege. But what do these four people want? And will hostage negotiator Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) be able to stop them? Theres a sense of a ticking clock hanging over the action as in so many heist movies and Lee whose output over the years has been wildly uneven (how could a filmmaker capable of a movie as good as ""Do the Right Thing"" make one as awful as his last film ""She Hate Me""?) turns out to have a knack for this kind of timing. ""Inside Man"" is easily the most Hollywood movie hes made filled with big-name stars and propelled by the sort of flashy back-and-forth screenplay (by Russell Gewirtz) that practically issues invitations to find its plot holes. And while it at times loses its way ultimately its a serviceable thriller raised to a higher level by its talented cast. Washington as always creates his character effortlessly with his trademark breeziness a nice match with the more high-strung characters around him. His Frazier is never hurried; he knows the power of the appearance of calm. Clive Owen as the ringleader of the burglars (and whose accent wanders across the Atlantic and back) crackles with barely contained anger; hes playing an enigma and seems to relish it. Jodie Foster playing a ill-defined power broker with spike heels and a Birkin bag (Ive no idea precisely what she does in her posh office but its obviously quite lucrative) does a nicely icy turn. Her character drops in and out of the movie but she provides a spark whenever shes on screen so much so that you wonder if the movie might have been more fun if shed had Owens role. (Somebody needs to cast Foster as a villain; shes got a delicious wickedness here thats barely tapped. And does anyone doubt that she could pull off a note-perfect heist?) Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Dirty Pretty Things"" ""Melinda and Melinda"") plays Fraziers more excitable younger partner Mitchell. Thrilled by the assignment he chirps ""Its the show"" And Christopher Plummer brings his mellifluous tones to the role of bank chairman Arthur Case who turns out to have a Dark Secret (oh youll see it coming) of his own. Lee moves these chess pieces around the board efficiently keeping our interest until the disappointingly lifeless ending. (For a movie that starts with such a bang it just seems to trickle off at the end.) And he fills the film with characters who suggest a crowded complicated city a Sikh hostage humiliated by the cops removal of his turban; a child unfazed by the days events (""Im from Brooklyn."") ""Inside Man"" is a potboiler but an intriguing one; perhaps Lee should go Hollywood more often.

Watching this stylish film you constantly re-evaluate the goings-on Is this the perfect bank robbery or something far more complex? Denzel Washington matches wits with masked man Clive Owen in Spike Lees Inside Man. Universal Pictures Exceptionally well written with clever twists and witty dialogue by first-time screenwriter Russell Gewirtz Inside Man is adroitly executed by director Spike Lee. The genre is a departure for Lee who brings his signature cinematic flourishes to a caper scenario and avoids the formulaic. (Watch for a trademark Lee camera shot with Denzel Washington on a dolly appearing to glide rather than run down a New York street.) About the movieInside Man    1/2 (out of four) Director Spike Lee Stars Denzel Washington Clive Owen Jodie Foster Chiwetel Ejiofor Distributor Universal Pictures Rating R for language violent images Running time 2 hours 9 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The elaborate scheme is initiated by a small group clad as nondescript painters who whip out guns and take bank customers hostage. But events dont unfold in chronological fashion. The film flashes forward to interviews of the hostages conducted by a topnotch Washington as a police detective who specializes in hostage negotiation. The interviews are shot in grainy stock giving them a gritty look of immediacy. And much of Lees camera work has a shaky nervy quality adding to the films considerable tension. The robbers led by a brilliant Clive Owen seem to have thought of everything. They dress everyone in identical painters gear so the police wont be able to tell the suspects from the hostages. Owen is no ordinary criminal. He and Washington match wits their tough stances artfully leavened by humor. About halfway through the mood takes an unusual turn becoming almost breezy then whipping back to taut suspense. As Washingtons partner Chiwetel Ejiofor makes an impact in what could have been a run-of-the-mill role. Willem Dafoe as an NYPD captain and Christopher Plummer as the banks chairman are solid while Washington and Owen give standout performances. Jodie Foster plays a power broker with traces of Silence of the Lambs steely-smart Clarice Starling augmented by a hefty dose of Machiavellian charm. Though Foster captures the right mixture of strength and verve its a tough character to buy a mysterious power broker who holds sway over New Yorks top political brass. Lee always has excelled in his portrayal of male characters but he has yet to reach similar heights with females. There are a couple of plot holes but nothing gaping and there is plenty to keep the audience guessing. Inside Man may be a cat-and-mouse game but its far from predictable. What could have been a straightforward thriller is unusually clever visually captivating and unfailingly entertaining.

Hes educated. Hes sleek. He understands police work better than the police do. He anticipates every move manipulates every standoff. He doesnt talk. He oooooozes. But with Inside Man an enjoyable jumble of a heist film from director Spike Lee we meet the latest upgrade the righteous omnipotent bad guy a politically correct morally crusading powerfully conscientious do-gooder. Hes decent Hes powerful Hes Ralph Nader with a .357 Magnum Sure hes after the moolah but greed isnt everything. Hes motivated by a profound and irreproachable desire to right some massive societal wrong. David Finchers Se7en introduced a forerunner more of a self-righteous Bible-thumper than righteous arbiter of justice. Same goes for the incendiary terrorist in V for Vendetta.Inside Man offers a much more scrupulous and globally minded anti-hero a giant-brained bank robber played by the smooth slouchy and ever-so-cool Clive Owen. Owen hasnt had much luck with movies lately His Derailed went off the tracks before it left the station. Inside Man serves him better but not well enough presenting his character as a criminal fait accompli lacking any psychic baggage. Who is this guy? Why is he obsessed with (fill in righteous crusade here)? Granted his crusade is one that most any human being would approve of -- cant fault him there -- but how and why he embarked on it remains a mystery. Was it something in his background? Does he even have a background? Which brings us back to our first question Who is this guy? For starters Owens robber has no obvious interest in cash. A big steaming vault of money bores the stink out of him. When he and his masked jumpsuited comrades hold up the Manhattan Trust Bank taking dozens of hostages he forces them all to don identical masks and jumpsuits and then herds them into offices to cool their heels. He tells the cops on the case -- led by Denzel Washington in a relaxed magnetic performance -- that he wants two getaway buses and a 747 pronto or hell start killing people. But maybe his real booty lies in a safe-deposit box unknown to anyone but its owner. Maybe he doesnt want or expect a plane. ""You saw Dog Day Afternoon. Youre stallin"" says Washingtons detective (ya think?). Darting in and out of this crisis are Christopher Plummer as a bank director with something to hide and Jodie Foster as the venal consultant he enjoins to keep it hidden. Its a splendid cast but the characters lack depth and the drama doesnt crackle. More satisfying are the films jangly New York humor and motley array of supporting players many of them featured in flash-forward police interrogations after the hubbub is over. Inside Man may be a genre flick but its direction is certifiably Lee -- sprinkled with trademark themes and visual cues including his specialty the strapped-to-a-factory-belt dolly shot. The movie could have used a red pencil and a pair of scissors but thats true of some of his best films too; hes congenitally prone to bagginess. More aggravating were plot holes so huge I almost fell and broke my neck in them. (If you figure out how Owens robber knew about the safe-deposit box e-mail me.)

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Promise this is not as farfetched as it sounds Spike Lees ""Inside Man"" is like ""American Idol"" contestant Chris Daughtry. Ill elaborate later. For the moment lets just say this taut bank-heist caper rocks. Mightily. A cast of smooth operators and a dynamic script by newcomer Russell Gewirtz keep it rolling. At just over two hours ""Inside Man"" earns every minute of our tense curiosity. The film poses then takes its own sweet time answering this question How could master thief Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) let his elaborately planned robbery devolve into a hostage situation in which 50 New Yorkers become like cards in a three-card monte game divided and shuffled from room to room? Or has he? Denzel Washington gives a jazz-cool turn as New York City hostage negotiator Keith Frazier. At the beginning of the movie hes in trouble with Internal Affairs. Seems 140000 in perp money has gone afield. He doesnt give in to worry. At least not about that. He frets more about his girlfriend pressing him to pop the question. Then theres Jodie Fosters behind-the-scenes power broker Madeline White who brings a wind-chill factor to the proceedings. Fixer for the elite she arrives at the cordoned Lower Manhattan bank with an agenda very different from Fraziers. Foster keeps her coutured character poised on a point between ambiguous and dark. Will she tip over? Maybe its Madelines carved confidence her perfected smile but Foster seldom gets to whet her edge this sharply. And here as in ""Syriana"" Christopher Plummer continues to stride like a titan of industry through his roles. Plummers Arthur Case is the founder of the bank under siege. He hires Madeline to end-run the cops and intervene with the robbers. But theres also something in his safety-deposit box that requires retrieval. He contends its nothing of value except to him. Riiight. Characters at cross purposes. A robber whose demands dont quite add up. Hostages who become suspects when the robbers force them to don the same disguises theyre wearing. Theres no red herring in ""Inside Man."" Theres a school of them. At the start of the film thief Russell looks at the camera and says ""Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words very carefully and I never repeat myself."" Theres menace but also a cheeky collegiality to his tone. Which isnt the same as saying were rooting for him only that these characters treat us like the movie-savvy adults we are. Lee never reaches for the obvious genre device. ""Inside Man"" doesnt stoop to conquer - us or the box office. Likely it will do both. Robbing us of some clues it rewards us with others. Lee and cinematographer Matthew Labitique forgo flashbacks but employ a grain-rich fast-forward. If Frazier and his partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are talking with a certain hostage it must mean some captives will survive. Whew. Yet knowing that does little to lessen our anxiety about what has happened. This constant bait-and-switch works just as well in other ways too. When Frazier and Mitchell arrive at the cordoned scene Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe) is already there with his team. Yes the filmmakers could have teased some point about a disgruntled officer (white) and the detective he must answer to (black). But why? Darius and Fraziers understated tension has as much to do with competing methods as old wounds. This is New York baby and few directors get the comedy and conflict of that city the way Spike Lee can. So a loud woman on her cell keeps barking at the Asian guy who keeps trying to get a look at her. An older Jewish woman refuses to strip down to her undies even with a gun in her face. From the opening scenes to its delicious resolution ""Inside Man"" pleases. It teases. Which brings us back to ""American Idol."" For a couple of months now we have been treated by the studios to movies that ply genre and flash star wattage. ""Freedomland"" had Samuel L. Jackson. Harrison Ford grows not-so-gracefully older in ""Firewall."" If Bruce Willis stumbled in ""16 Blocks"" it wasnt his fault so much as the plotholes created by the script. Now in struts ""Inside Man."" I feel like Simon Cowell saying the unthinkable week after week ""Inside Man"" you show us what a real Hollywood movie should be. You humble the competition.

"Inside Man scores big - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Inside Man scores big By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 24 2006 For partisans walking into a new Spike Lee film can be a nerve-racking experience. Whats he going to do now? And how far off the deep end will he go? Last time it was the epically rejected She Hate Me"" a big fat farce about a buppie and the lesbians he was paid to impregnate. It had more on its mind than most people were willing to concede but its insanity remains inarguable.Now its on to a bank-robbery thriller Inside Man"" which stars Denzel Washington Clive Owen Jodie Foster Chiwetel Ejiofor Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer. This is probably Lees most purely enjoyable movie a radical departure too insofar as its package is conventional genre stuff with a twist of French crime classic. But the script by first-timer Russell Gewirtz is skintight (for a Lee film) and Lees filmmaking is playful yet unusually calm.The basic story is elemental but because Lee and Gewirtz invest it with grit comedy and a ton of New York ethnic personality its fresh anyway. The first 10 minutes are a wonderful reminder of why I havent been inside a bank in almost two years and its not because a gang disguised as painters might walk in and hold up the place. Its because people on cellphones waiting in line seem more annoying than people with guns.The man running the operation is Dalton Russell a peevish dude played by Owen with his usual growling insinuation. In the first scene he looks right into the camera and brags that hes planned an ingenious heist. Part of its genius includes forcing his dozens of hostages to strip to their skivvies and put on dark hooded coveralls that match the robbers. This could be the start of Die Hard 6."" But by this point the movie has already distinguished itself.Weve seen Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) talking nasty on the phone to his silky-voiced cop-girlfriend played by Cassandra Freeman. (Lee always has the jazziest black women in the most thankless parts.) Frazier is in hot water over a missing 180000 or so. But he and his partner Bill Mitchell (Ejiofor) are given the Wall Street robbery anyway. They cant believe it. Theyre psyched to be on the job and that anticipation is contagious. No crusty jaded Bruce Willis detectives for us. Frazier even puts on a snazzy Panama hat for the occasion.Just as those two wings of the movie get going the film leaves the tension at the bank and drops in on a posh apartment where Madeline White (Foster) is about to get a call from the banks stern owner (Plummer). Hed like her to fetch something secret"" from his safe deposit box. Madeline cuts through the movie with great occupational vagueness. But Foster dressed in revealing business suits with her skin shiny tight and tanned has never looked more expensive or redolent of sorority. The character is high-class well connected and possibly sleazy marching down to City Hall to wring a favor from the mayor.These three sides build to a number of nifty if implausible climaxes. More than its plot and the admittedly bizarre motives behind the bank robbery Inside Man"" is a personality-driven throwback with one foot firmly in this era. A couple of times someone references a Sidney Lumet picture and in some respects this movie might have been one of his. But this is Lees third film since 9/11 and you can feel the sociopolitical ground shifting.One of the banks hostages is Vikram (the excellent Waris Ahluwalia) a young Sikh whom the robbers release early with a message tied around his neck. The NYPD officers on the scene assume hes Arab and that the message is a bomb. They rough him up then swipe his turban. When Frazier and Mitchell interrogate him later in a booth at a diner Vikram refuses to discuss the heist until his turban is returned then condemns his harassment. When hes done Washington says But I bet you can still get a cab."" In this single moment which is more vivid than almost all of Crash"" we see the sad modern hierarchy of American bigotry.Lee also gets in an eloquent dig at black-male gangstas. They run amok here in a little boys video game a shoot-em-up so morally appalling that even Owens nasty bank robber takes offense.This is a big Hollywood movie with Lees usual truckload of ideas and energetic performances from the entire cast. Washington hasnt been this relaxed in years. When he feels like it he can be the most charismatic star in the movies. His smile which he flashes in the joshing interrogation scenes sprinkled throughout the film is a dentists dream. This is a simmering intelligent piece of acting that for a change stays below the emotional radar. Washington is having a good time. So is Foster who seems happy not to have to roll up her sleeves and bruise people. She and Washington have a pair of crackling scenes together in which they really seem to be studying each other. Enough cant be said of actors who like their material. If they buy it so will we.And Lee is suavely selling -- but not selling out. Hes found a way to matter as an entertainer without copping out as an artist. The fact that Brian Grazer has produced Inside Man"" might strike some people as odd like Phil Spector trying to tame the Last Poets. But the movie is unmistakably a Spike Lee Joint. Hes surrounded by his usual precision band which still keeps sizzling harmony Barry Alexander Brown on editing Wynn Thomas on production design Terence Blanchard on score Matthew Libatique back for his second tour with Lee on photography and Washington on the lead.For Lee working with Grazer is just an opportunity. Everything is. Hes been itching for something to catch commercially his whole career and this superbly crafted movie looks like his best chance yet.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Spike Lees Inside Man. Slate Sign In Sign Up Spike Lees Inside Man. Spike Lees Inside Man. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 23 2006 624 PM The Big Score Spike Lee and Denzel Washington reunite in Inside Man. By Grady Hendrix Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster in Inside Man Inside Man (Universal) is the best Spike Lee movie to come along since 1992s Malcolm X. Its also the first Spike Lee movie since He Got Game  to star Denzel Washington and just as Jimmy Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock brought out the best in each other Denzel and Spike need each other like vermouth and gin. Theyre OK on their own but mix them together and pretty soon youve not only forgotten your problems but youve forgotten what problems even were in the first place. Denzel plays Keith Frazier an NYPD hostage negotiator riding herd on a standoff outside a lower Manhattan bank after a group of robbers have strolled in and taken everyone hostage. Heist flicks are usually exercises in white-knuckle tension as people shout at each other over the phone diamond-tipped drills pierce layered titanium vaults underarm perspiration soaks through shirts and the trigger-happy SWAT team chomps at the bit eager to bust through the windows and fill everyone with lead. Advertisement But Inside Man is adult contemporary and completely relaxed. No one shouts few people sweat the criminals dont have to drill the vault doors because theyre standing wide open. The SWAT team is so cooperative that at the end of the movie I expected Washington to tip them. Hes a pillar of cool and the most tension he generates comes from his hat a straw fedora that you watch with bated breath waiting for someone to sit on it. Otherwise Washington strolls through the film constantly interrupting himself and speaking so softly that he compels lesser men to listen. At the height of the standoff he turns to Willem Dafoe (who in a jarring turn isnt the bad guy) and says ""Well be at the deli down the street."" You wont hear lines like that in a Michael Mann movie. The tension comes courtesy Jodie Foster in an extended cameo playing the most uptight white woman in the world. Unconvincing in high heels Foster is a shadowy power broker who wields tickets to charity events and whom the Bin Ladens call when their nephew needs a Manhattan apartment. Shes hired by the banks founder Christopher Plummer to protect the deep dark secret hes had to hide away in one of its safe-deposit boxes. The criminals also have secrets and rather than stuffing money into bags they seem intent on performing some kind of complicated magic trick that involves shuffling hostages from room to room. It turns out that this isnt a heist film after all but a mash-up between Cotton Comes to Harlemthe laid-back cop classic that launched the blaxploitation genre in 1970 and an unmade sequel to The Sound of Music where Christopher Plummers Captain Von Trapp returns to the motherland and goes into business with the Nazis. In Spike Lees New York the rich and powerful have buried the bodies of their past victims in the foundations of their glittering new cities and few people can afford to say that they smell the stench. Critics have tended to reduce Lee to a bundle of provocations and made him a spokesman for race since hes just about the only director wholl mention it. (When he makes films like 2000s Bamboozled they can be forgiven.) The net effect is that over the last few years critics have tended to ignore his moviemaking and their enthusiasm for the bouncy Inside Man is almost as if they were saying ""If you stop behaving outrageously and come to the table on our terms then well listen to you."" But Inside Man is nothing less than a Spike Lee joint a well-mannered older brother to his uneven Clockers (1995). It sports the same trolley shots a ghetto-crime video game (here called Kill That Nigga instead of Gangsta) and even a prominently displayed bottle of the Bomb that movies imaginary bomb-shaped malt liquor.More than anything it makes the case for Lee as the pre-eminent chronicler of modern-day New York. The coolness and the crudity the attitude and the alienation he nails down every detail with a clear-eyed precision as if hes never seen a movie set in the city before. Suspects are interrogated at the corner deli a vital clue hinges on breast size cops halt the negotiations for a heated debate over Grand Central Station and when Denzel needs to identify a foreign language he just walks out into the crowd of onlookers and asks Does anyone speak this? Predictably someone raises his hand. Correction March 24 2006 In an earlier version of this article the author incorrectly stated that Malcolm X was the last Spike Lee movie to star Denzel Washington. It was He Got Game. (Return to corrected sentence.) Grady Hendrix is one of the founders of the New York Asian Film Festival and he writes about pop culture on his blog.

""Pay strict attention to what I say"" he intones ""because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself."" Yes sir. When Clive Owens is enunciating youd better be all ears.It turns out that Owenss Dalton Russell is a bank robber and his words are meant to be taken literally. In order to follow the convolutions of his self-proclaimed perfect crime you need to keep continually focused. But even then the movie with its flashbacks and flashforwards slips in and out of intelligibility.""Inside Man"" which was scripted by Russell Gewirtz is not a model of storytelling even though it is somewhat redeemed by its fresh take and trick ending. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Well maybe not totally fresh. At one point after Russell and his platoon have invaded the Wall Street branch of a worldwide bank and taken 50 people hostage the NYPD hostage negotiator Denzel Washingtons Keith Frazier makes a crack about ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and you think Yes Ive seen this sort of thing before. Russell is demanding a jet to flee the country and Frazier complains that that didnt even happen in the Al Pacino film. (But it did. Its just that the plan was foiled on the runway.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Neither is the character of Frazier altogether fresh to the genre. Newly promoted ambiguously mired in a corruption scandal hes the generic NYPD hostage negotiator worn and wily. When he realizes hes up against a criminal mastermind and not a blunderer he becomes a bit more interesting. Frazier doesnt like to think of himself as case-hardened even if everyone else around him is and the battle of wits switches him into a higher gear. Washington enjoys breaking the mold. In a couple of scenes where Frazier believes hes bested his adversary he brings a much-needed street energy to the part.Coming after a long stretch of socially conscious movies ""The Inside Man"" is Lees most commercially oriented project to date. He hasnt had a hit in a long time and he hasnt made a good movie in a long time either. No doubt his admirers will regret the absence of any real social or racial bent in this film but I was relieved. Lees movies are so overwrought and argumentative with characters who only serve as mouthpieces that something like ""The Inside Man"" is welcome. Hes a better filmmaker if not idealogue when hes playing it straight.There are a few Spike Lee-isms that creep in such as Fraziers interrogation of a turbaned Sikh hostage complaining of rough treatment. The scene has a goofy improvisatory feel that suggests this is the kind of movie Lee wishes he was making. Mostly though the performances except for Washingtons are reined in. Owen spends most of his time wearing a white cloth mask which doesnt cut down on his diction in the least. Between this and Hugo Weavings masked role in ""V for Vendetta"" aspiring actors may begin to question whether they need to spend all that money on glossy resume photos.Jodie Foster plays some kind of power broker to the stars whose intellect is as severe as her wardrobe. Christopher Plummer plays the nefarious benefactor of her services an entrepreneur and philanthropist with a whopping secret to hide. His previous experience playing Shakespeares Iago must have come in handy here.Even with these stars and this director do we really need another bank robbery heist flick? Lee and his screenwriter pull off a nice switcheroo at the end but theres nothing terribly dynamic about the way New York is used in this film. In Sidney Lumets ""Dog Day Afternoon"" which only looks better with the years New York was as much a character in that film as its people. It was a movie that took its cue from the energy of the city. ""The Inside Man"" takes its cue mostly from other movies. Grade B- Rated R for language and some violent images.Sex/Nudity 3 instances of innuendo. Violence 20 scenes. Profanity 118 instances mostly harsh. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 8 scenes of smoking and 2 with drinking.

"Soaring Interest washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Soaring Interest A hostage negotiator (Denzel Washington right with Willem Dafoe) plays cat and mouse with a bank robber in Spike Lees propulsive thriller. (By David Lee) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 24 2006 Some movies are too clever by half but most are not clever enough by nine-tenths; Spike Lees new ""Inside Man"" gets the recipe just right. A deft tense pure thriller with great star turns and brilliant directing it began as an extremely well-crafted screenplay by Russell Gewirtz whose first script (not merely written but sold and produced) this was. The result is what might be called ""professionally entertaining"" like the glossier extravaganzas of the big studio decades full of attractive people smart dialogue vigorous reimaginings of classic situations surprises and final satisfaction. No surprise then that its a total mainstream job fronted by Brian Grazers Imagine Films and apparently first set to be directed by Mr. Middlebrow himself Ron Howard. Lee brings something however that Howard has notably lacked over his career incredible camera energy. Throughout the movie the camera is almost a character. It drifts through penetrating the action floating up and down stairs circling antagonists in the many hostile (but always amusing) confrontations. The movie is exceptionally comfortable in its in-your-face dynamics Lee may be at his best when people are shouting at each other or deploying other forms of verbal aggression trying to manipulate this way and that groping for leverage trying to avoid getting pinned. Everybodys a con As Gewirtz has it one morning a staid rather traditional Wall Street bank (it looks like the Thatcher Library in ""Citizen Kane"") is swiftly taken over by a crew of heavily armed thoroughly professional bank robbers. They know how to neutralize the video cameras (infrared spotlight in the lenses) how to deal with hostages (firmly but not savagely) where everything is (including a crucial if seemingly innocuous storeroom). You can tell their leader because hes the one in a mask and sunglasses; oh wait everyones in mask and sunglasses including rather quickly the hostages. You can tell their leader because even behind the mask and sunglasses he radiates command presence and most interestingly hes got wit. Hes sardonic amused unflappable. His weapon is the .357 Magnum revolver but its also the put-down the quip the ironically lofted eyebrow. You never saw a man act so brilliantly behind a mask (you sure didnt in ""V for Vendetta"") but possibly it shouldnt be a surprise for the man behind that mask is Clive Owen gen-u-wine movie star. Cops quickly gather headed by second-string negotiator Detective Keith Frazier (gen-u-wine movie star Denzel Washington) also a fast guy with a quip and no slouch in the charisma department either. Soon enough men with big guns -- you know the type black plastic and scary -- are all over the place; Lee is also very good on city hubbub and he gets a gritty sense of urban frenzy media focus workplace squabble (even in the SWAT van) and micromanagement from outside. But soon enough Detective Frazier and The Man in the Cotton Mask are on the phone doing a nice ""Dog Day Afternoon"" imitation which is funny because both of them have seen ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and realize theyre in a version of it in reality. But just when you think the movies going to settle down to ""Dog Day Afternoon II The Very Similar Sequel"" it mutates weirdly (the first of several times) with the arrival of a third gen-u-wine movie star. This is Jodie Foster as one Madeline White who is by profession a . . . well its one of those nameless jobs that just are. She sort of makes things happen. You know youve been looking for someone like this your whole life and if youd have found her you would have ended up much better off. She gets things done with a phone call here a lunch there. She knows people family histories financial details seems to survive nicely as a courtier to the ultra-rich so much so that she can get the mayor of New York on the phone and give him marching orders. Certainly its a romantic conceit but Foster is notable for her presence her ice-doll sense of certitude for the power of the rectitude behind those 5000-lumen babyblues so even if her profession is at the outside edge of believability Fosters strength of personality makes you believe. Her task working on behalf of the banks founder (a frosty aristo turn by Christopher Plummer) is to make certain that no one discovers what is in Safe Deposit Box 392. (Or maybe its 292 or 157; I forgot) These three play cat-and-mouse-and-cat though depending on circumstances they take turns being predator and prey. Its a thoroughly delightful game that builds toward a truly original denouement. Thus it falls to Washingtons Frazier to work it out although as his supervisor speculates ""There seems not to have been a crime."" Of course theres a crime. The crime is that more movies arent this provocative. The crime is that more directors dont have Lees gift for invective and camera movement and for keeping a complex plot thrusting ahead neatly without ever quite toppling over into incoherence (the thriller-killer). The crime is that more film composers cant put together a score like jazz great (and longtime Lee collaborator) Terence Blanchards whose riffs float magically on the air giving the movie a tragic dimension when at last its moral dilemma is exposed. The crime is that more writers cant play the now-you-see it now-you-dont game that Gewirtz is such a pro at. I would say this may not be Lees best film -- its clearly a more impersonal less passionate work than ""Do the Right Thing"" or ""Jungle Fever"" -- but its his most complete. Its about the tale not the teller. Inside Man (129 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for psychological intensity and one scene of extreme violence and profanity.

"Inside Man | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; inside-man ) Inside Man (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli With so much talent involved - both in front of and behind the camera - one has a right to anticipate something special from Inside Man. Does it deliver? Spike Lees latest joint is a workmanlike thriller that provides solid performances; a mixture of comedy tension and drama; and an engaging storyline. But theres nothing extraordinary about the movie. Its watchable and occasionally compelling but it will not stand out as one of 2006s great motion pictures. One could argue that a cast with this much wattage hasnt been assembled since Twilight (Paul Newman Gene Hackman Susan Sarandon Reese Witherspoon). In addition to headliners Denzel Washington and Clive Owen Inside Man features supporting performances from Jodie Foster Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe. You know a film has an impressive cast when the best Dafoe can do is fifth billing. But if proof was ever needed that gathering a large group of A-list stars doesnt automatically translate into a great film this is it. Inside Man has a standard-issue heist plot pitting bank robbers (with hostages) against cops while an interested third party muddies the waters. Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) is the leader of a gang of four masked men who lock down a Manhattan bank. Holed up with several dozen hostages he appears to be executing the perfect bank robbery - but hes more interested in the contents of one safety deposit box than in the vaults cash. Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and his partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are the plainclothes officers in charge of the negotiations. Captain Darius (Willem Dafoe) has an itchy trigger finger and is anxious to storm the bank. Meanwhile the head of Case Banks board of directors (Christopher Plummer) is concerned that the contents of his safety deposit box not become public knowledge. To ensure that he hires Madeliene White (Jodie Foster) a ""fixer"" with highly placed contacts and an impeccable reputation to broker a deal with Russell. The strength of the film is that the criminals start smart and finish smart. Theres no third act breakdown of intelligence designed to facilitate a clean ending. For most of the film Russell and Frazier are evenly matched. In their cat-and-mouse game they take turns outwitting one another. The script would have been better served by presenting more of their brinksmanship. The introduction of White is an unnecessary complication that serves no purpose beyond giving Jodie Foster something to do. Not that Foster does a bad job - its just that her character isnt needed. Denzel Washington is as reliable as ever. His portrayal of Frazier is probably one he could do in his sleep but he invests the character with a fierce determination and a degree of moral ambiguity. Fundamentally Frazier is a good guy but he has his price. Clive Owen is hamstrung by the need to disguise his face and speak with a clipped American accent. Its tough to shine in those circumstances. Director Spike Lee is in ""big budget"" mode which means he presents things in a reasonably straightforward manner. There are flashes of vintage Lee material (such as when a kid is shown playing a Grand Theft Auto-type video game highlighted by black-on-black violence) but these are sidebars. The main story is told in a clear-cut manner with periods of moderate tension and a surprisingly high quota of low-key humor. No one would classify Inside Man as a comedy but its less heavy (and heavy-handed) than one might expect from a Spike Lee picture. When Inside Man focuses on the give-and-take between cop and criminal its on sound ground. Their interaction is like a high stakes game of poker with neither knowing the others hand and each uncertain where the bluffing begins. Within this context things work. As a whole the movie is entertaining but unremarkable. Exiting the theater my comment to a colleague was that I enjoyed it but it should have been better. And therein lies the curse of expecting too much from a March release - even a high-profile one.

Movies Read EWs original Inside Man review on the movies 10th anniversary by Lisa Schwarzbaum Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Enlarge Photo Close Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (David Lee) B+ Posted March 22 2006 -- 1200 AM EST As Inside Man busts open some guys dressed like industrial painters descend on a New York bank one of those somber marble edifices built to last as long as the dollar rules. The intruders stride in wearing sunglasses scarflike masks worker jumpsuits and painter caps. Then they hold up the place at gunpoint forcing some 50 male and female hostages to don identity-blurring jumpsuits and sunglasses too. The gang led by stern ringleader Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) appear to be bank robbers in search of whats in the vault. But theyre in no hurry to take the money and run. Instead as Det. Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) discovers when he begins negotiations with Russell the cat-and-mouse head game is to Russell its own reward. Fraziers a complicated cat himself ambivalent about proposing to his girl ambivalent about clearing his name in a corruption charge an angry black cop dressed like a dandy in a white-power world. The bank chairman Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) a suave old-world type is a conundrum too -- hes suspiciously worried about the contents of one safe-deposit box. And to that end mid-hostage-crisis Case hires Madeline White (Jodie Foster) an elegant (and wouldnt you know complicated) corporate ""fixer"" to broker a deal that would leave that particular box off Russells must-have list. Foster gleefully musters her throatiest ballbuster voice as she heel-toes her way around in expensive cream-colored suits and fierce stilettos a siren of shady dealing whod do well selling secrets on 24. Theres mystery to what Madeline is really up to but thats just one among many in Russell Gewirtzs grabber of a first script Everyones complicated in this jam-packed spring-loaded contraption everyones sneaky compromised clever nervous mouthy opinionated and New Yorky. Even the hostages are choice -- theres a young woman who gabs obnoxiously into her cell phone the little black kid playing a jolly-horrid videogame called Kill Dat Nigga an old rabbi worried about diamonds an elderly woman who would rather be shot than strip to her undies in public. Everyones prime material in other words for Spike Lee to fashion his first mainstream bring-in-the-box-office adventure. Inside Man is a hybrid of studio action pic and Spike Lee joint. Or else its a cross between a 2006 Spike Lee joint and a 1970s-style movie indictment of urban unease. Its also a blend of Dog Day Afternoon and a Foster tough-lady thriller; of a Foster thriller and a smooth Owen sleight-of-hand drama; and of an Owen caper and a Washington out-for-justice pic. Some unwieldy hybrid -- and yet the gamble pays off. Everyone gets a piece of the deal. Everyone gets a piece of the city with the brutally changed skyline in all its new paranoia. Gewirtzs script spells out the power snarls between Frazier and his police captain (Willem Dafoe) and between Frazier and Russell (more of a concept than a character despite Owens energetic efforts at creating dimension). But its Lee whose eye seizes the continuously recalibrated details of race gender culture and socioeconomic power with which New Yorkers have sized one another up with even more anxiety since the towers fell. A Sikh hostage is distraught and insulted when under interrogation his turban is taken from him. (Hes fed up with being mistaken for an Arab.) An Albanian woman brought in by the cops to translate chatter picked up by surveillance barters her bilingual abilities for amnesty from a shopping bag filled with parking tickets. The videogame-playing kid tells Russell ""Im not scared. Im from Brooklyn."" Lee also from Brooklyn hangs on to some old tricks that have outstayed their welcome. One favored camera tic in which a fella appears to float while the world zooms behind him tells us nothing when turned on Plummers bank mogul. The jazzish score by Lees music man Terence Blanchard is typically intrusive. But the mood is right the twists are new. And with one casting inspiration Inside Man furthers the rising stardom of Chiwetel Ejiofor (Serenity). Playing Fraziers detective partner with perfect New York diction the magnetic British-born actor raises Washingtons game in every scene the two share. (Denzel looms large but his energy level also fluctuates.) In a movie about zigging and zagging that extra boost is as necessary to negotiations as the pizzas delivered to hungry hostages in New York-flavored movies the world over.

A thriller that aims to be different ""Inside Man"" stirs some very tasty flavors into its familiar bank robbery/hostage crisis plot which helps conceal the modest portion of the central ingredient suspense. A flashy cast clever script and vibrant showcasing of New York City as the ultimate melting pot are strong plusses for Spike Lees most mainstream studio venture which Denzel Washingtons name should propel to solid returns for Universal. No matter the diversity of his projects one thing Lee has never been is a genre filmmaker. While his interests and instincts remain elsewhere he does throw himself into the spirit of things here briskly setting the lay of the land -- the stately Manhattan Trust Bank in the Wall Street area -- and efficiently presenting its takeover by a band of four masked and armed intruders led by Dalton Russell (Clive Owen). As Russell and his cohorts corral 50 hostages dress them in identical baggy outfits and masks and roughly threaten them it quickly becomes clear the ringleader is an unusually smart criminal. However his motives and intentions -- issues first-time scripter Russell Gewirtz deliberately evades as long as he can -- remain unclear. There are piles of money in the vault tantalizingly ripe for the picking but the wily perp seems to have his mind on something else. Under the circumstances the detective in charge Keith Frazier (Washington sporting a thin moustache and near-shaven head) sees no alternative but to play a waiting game. In the doghouse at headquarters and assigned to the case with partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) only as a substitute Frazier in league with Emergency Services officer John Darius (Willem Dafoe) suppresses the urge to take any untoward action that could endanger the hostages indulging only in innocuous schemes such as sneaking hidden microphones into the bank in pizza boxes. To fill the time until Russell makes a move Lee and Gewirtz begin layering the action with elements both germane and incidental. Snippets of post-crisis hostage interviews create the impression they got away unharmed as did evidently the hold-up crew. These exchanges are often amusing but introducing them so early in the proceedings reps a double-edge sword as they inevitably reduce whatever tension had been generated up to then. Then there are the machinations of the banks founder and chairman Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) who enlists ambiguous high-end power-broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to monitor the sensitive contents of his personal safe-deposit box. Revelations concerning these hidden items ultimately prove dramatically crucial. But while the substance of the secrets has topical validity pics credibility is seriously compromised by the great unlikelihood that Case would allow such potentially damaging material to exist. Still Lee insures the substance of the film consists as much in its texture and details as its plot. It may seem like a predictable cliche especially to the directors detractors that he so intently underlines the ethnicity of even the most minor characters; much is made of the rainbow brigade that constitutes the hostage group the white woman who talks loudly on her cell phone; the young Sikh hostage who when released strenuously complains of being mistaken for an Arab; the glam Albanian sexpot who knows how to play her cards and the young black hostage whose ultraviolent ""Kill Dat Nigga"" computer game gives pause even to Russell. Lee makes a point of showing New York and by extension American society top to bottom from politicos and power players in their extravagantly appointed lairs to drug-addled deadbeats like the teen brother of Fraziers girlfriend. Mostly of course there are the working stiffs in the middle including most of the hostages and the cops who just try to get through each day. ""Dog Day Afternoon"" serves as an acknowledged template here but aside from the central bank hostage situation driven by unconventional reasons the differences are more marked than the similarities; Sidney Lumets film was notable for grand theatrics and the spectacle of the media/law enforcement frenzy two aspects ""Inside Man"" shies away from. While far from the most compelling character Washington has played Frazier is interesting enough a savvy confident guy alternately prudent and rash who hasnt advanced professionally as far as he wants. Hed like to think he can outwit his crafty adversary although only a long-distance mind-reader could deduce what Russells really up to. Fraziers sartorial selections which include classy suits the occasional bow tie and spiffy straw hat command attention of their own. As the mastermind Owen is commanding despite being hidden behind a mask much for the time while Foster seems to be having fun with a change-of-pace role as the elegant far-more-superior-than-thou intermediary. With Matthew Libatique behind the camera for his second consecutive picture with Lee rough-and-ready visuals are of a piece with those of the helmers previous pics.
