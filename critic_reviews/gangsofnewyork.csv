More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Or maybe Scorsese was too stubborn to give up a project he had nurtured since 1970 when the epic was still the genre du jour and on Belfasts mean streets Protestants and Catholics were spilling one anothers blood in a replay of the New York City Irish-Anglo gang wars of the 1860s which Scorsese was itching to dramatize. Then Star Wars changed the landscape of the epic from our own martial planet to a galaxy far far away. Today when audiences go into the past they want fantasy. Theyre not looking to pay for history lessons.

If so it is a gasp that sings howls like a grand tenor at an Irish wake. Set in the gaudy pestilential Five Points section of lower Manhattan Gangs begins with an 1846 street fight Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his Nativists against Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) and his horde of Hibernians. It ends in 1863 with another rumble -- Bill now battling Priests vengeful son Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio)--as the city explodes in riots that escalate from a protest against Civil War conscription to a four-day massacre. In between are violent scenes played out with a ferocity as erotic as it is deranged; murder and mutilation when performed by men who have been close are acts more intimate than sex. Theres a triangular conflict -- an evil man the rival he has treated like a son and the woman (Cameron Diaz) they both have loved and used -- with three stars at the top of their form. DiCaprios winsomeness has matured into a wily assurance that doesnt rely on bravado. Diaz stifling the giggles displays a grave bruised beauty. Day-Lewis struts with the insane intensity and twisted grin of early Robert De Niro; the Butcher loves the monster he has become. For most of its galloping 2-hr. 45-min. span Gangs confidently enlarges this triangle to include the sweeping vision of a New York suddenly swarming with immigrants. Displaying an urgency and elegance unmatched by any other living auteur Scorsese finds drama in visual contrast a door in a dark noisy room that is kicked open to reveal a silent snow-laden street. One amazing panorama shows men coming off a ship from Ireland being immediately conscripted and outfitted in Northern blue then put on a troop ship -- all in a single shot that ends with a view of the troop ships cargo 20 coffins on the dock. As the newcomers gain political power through their numbers the question isnt whether an Irishman can be elected to city office but whether he can survive his victory. Ruthless toughs mingle with 1860s gentry in a colossal mix of Scorseses Mean Streets and The Age of Innocence. Gangs is the directors proclamation that all his movies about belligerent young men are modern-dress versions of a crucial melodrama that shaped urban America. Gangs is the prototype for every one of Scorseses films; it just happens to come after them. At the films climax the Draft Riots engulf the city as Bill and Amsterdam line up for their final face-off -- a Celtic clan skirmish that has little to do with the larger atrocities. The point may be that the problems of three little people dont amount to a hill of corpses when anarchy breaks loose. This daring perhaps confusing declaration of irrelevance suggests that the epic is a form a director like Scorsese must subvert even as he invokes it. But it doesnt erase the sordid splendor of Scorseses congested conflicted entrancing achievement. --By Richard Corliss Previous Page 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page Home U.S. Politics World Business Tech Health Science Entertainment Newsfeed Living Ideas Parents Sports History The TIME Vault Magazine Subscribe Give a Gift TIME Shop Newsletters Customer Service Site Map Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights Terms of Use Advertising Ad Choices (c) 2016 Time Inc.

"Gangs of New York is too damned short. Slate Sign In Sign Up Gangs of New York is too damned short. Gangs of New York is too damned short. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 20 2002 516 PM Let It Bleed Gangs of New York is too damned short. By David Edelstein Leonardo DiCaprio gets tough In Martin Scorseses long-anticipated Gangs of New York (Miramax) Daniel Day-Lewis plays William Cutting aka ""Bill the Butcher"" who in his stove-top hat and long maroon waistcoat is almost a demonic twin of Uncle Sam HE DOESNT WANT YOU Ruminating on the ""Hibernian hordes"" disembarking from ships and settling on Manhattans Lower East Side he assures Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) that hed ""shoot each and every one of them before they set foot on American soil."" To drive home the point he cheerfully cleaves a few in twain. A ""Native"" American (""born rightwise to this land"") he doesnt want his people competing for jobs with ""the bastard sons of Erin"" or giving the country over ""to them who had no hand in fighting for it."" So he makes the immigrants fight him for it every day with knives and razors and cudgels. Advertisement Although Cutting didnt exist some of these battles (and the gangs with colorful names like Shirt Tails Plug Uglies and Daybreak Boys) were recounted in Herbert Asburys 1928 chronicle Gangs of New York which Scorsese reportedly read in 1970 and has been itching to adapt ever since. It isnt hard to see what turned him on. Scorsese grew up steeped in a different sort of tribal lore in Little Italy and Asburys book offered a rare glimpse at those same streets from the 1840s through the 1860s before his Italian ancestors showed up. He also saw a chance to make an American movie in the tradition of Luchino Viscontis The Leopard (1963) Bernardo Bertoluccis 1900 (1976) and Sergio Leones Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Once Upon a Time in America (1984) a bloody wide-screen epic that mixes elemental stories of love and revenge with a vision of the larger historical forces that shaped the capitalist society we know today. The movie from a script by Jay Cocks Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan is not the disaster that has long been rumored (and that its studio Miramax evidently thinks it is). Whatever its fate at the box office its a magnificent achievement--holes tatters crudities screw-ups and all. The problem is that a definitive assessment is impossible as long as were stuck with a 2-hour-and-45-minute cut in lieu of Scorseses preferred 3-and-a-half-hour version. Its rarely a good idea to review a movie one hasnt seen--and the longer cut if it ever shows up could prove to be deadly. But I doubt it. The film in its current state cries out for a wider canvas for more and longer scenes of the universe outside its central triangle of movie stars and ham-fisted melodrama. Gangs of New York begins as the story of a boy Amsterdam Vallon and his tribe and Scorsese has you first believing its a flashback to medieval Ireland The Irish led by Amsterdams solemn father (Liam Neeson) Priest Vallon sharpen their knives kneel before a cross and ritualistically proceed through a cavernous warehouse to the street--an American 19th-century street on which they meet Day-Lewis Bill the Butcher and his blue-kerchiefed army of ""Nativists."" The carnage that follows is a little too self-consciously stylized for my taste--it features a slew of mythically low-angle close-ups of combatants along with half-second images of split skulls and blood geysers. But Scorsese establishes that the violence will be ferocious and horrific not exhilarating. And as the butcher carves up Priset Vallon in front of his young sons eyes he shows the primal caveman rage of these men who regard the stakes as monumental. The first two-thirds of the movie is shaped as a classical revenge tale with Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) returning  from the ""House of Refuge"" reformatory after 16 years. Concealing his identity from everyone but his friend Johnny (Henry Thomas) Amsterdam insinuates himself into Bill the Butchers gang which includes some of his fathers old cohorts. And then in spite of himself Amsterdam begins to be drawn to the charismatic older man who celebrates the killing of Priest Vallon not with mockery but genuine reverence as the overthrow of an honorable warrior king. The dynamic is more interesting than that of the usual revenge saga It even carries a whiff of Goodfellas (1990) in the way that Amsterdam starts to enjoy the power of being in Bills inner circle--to the point of protecting Bill from other would-be assassins. Advertisement The older man becomes Amsterdams teacher in the art of killing and he doesnt seem to mind when the youth takes up with a woman he once slept with and nurtured the beauteous pickpocket Jenny (Cameron Diaz). In the films most oddly touching scene Amsterdam having just made love to Jenny wakes to find Bill sitting in a rocking chair beside the bed eager to talk about the day he cut his own eye out when it looked away from an enemy the dead priest Vallon and the crumbling of civilization. ""God bless you"" Bill concludes. Liam Neeson before the fall In the past Scorseses most evocative work was shot on actual streets but the New York of Gangs of New York was created from scratch in Rome at the Cinecitta Studios. The director cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and production designer Dante Ferretti have gone for a dark palette with low smoky skies and colors unintensified by sunlight. Working closely with Luc Sante who documented the era in his irresistible history Low Life theyve created a jumbled claustrophobic maze of listing wooden shacks and walkways of cobblestone streets winding in and out of muddy paths. Theres a lavish music-hall staging of Uncle Toms Cabin and a Chinese opera; and when Amsterdam prevails upon his fathers old ally Monk McGinn (Brendan Gleeson) to run against Bill the Butchers candidate for sheriff Scorsese packs a whole political campaign into a couple of tumultuous minutes. Its a circus of a city teeming with extras looking impressively busy. You can sense that Scorsese lost himself in this ecosystem--and that he lost control of the drama along the way. Cameron Diaz begins delectably as a hellion a pickpocket a ""bludget"" (alley robber) a ""turtle dove"" (housemaid impostor) and ""a prim-lookin stargazer"" (prostitute). But suddenly shes a boringly conventional ingenue torn between her new love and her former surrogate daddy. And the screenwriters forgot to give DiCaprio a way to hold his own against Day-Lewis He shows little of the spring-heeled impudence he had in Titanic (1997) and has in the coming Catch Me If You Can. Leo is left to watch dourly from behind a grubby little chin-beard while his co-star chews the scenery. The DiCaprio-Diaz nonevent wouldnt matter as much if the movie hadnt been edited to emphasize the love triangle in lieu of other more epic matters. Gangs of New York doesnt climax merely with the face-off between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher It builds to the New York Draft Riots of 1863 when a mob of mostly Irish immigrants (some of them fresh off the boat) took to the streets to protest being shipped off to die on the front lines of the Civil War. (Sons of the elite could buy out of the draft for the then-princely sum of 300.) Suddenly Amsterdams tribe--until now the good guys--are shown lynching many newly emancipated African-Americans and getting blown away by federal troops; and the death-struggle between Amsterdam and Bill becomes absurdly beside the point. Thats a profound--and surprising--change of direction for the movie. It signals the end of medieval tribalism and the coming of a new nationalized power. But as the film has been trimmed (at the behest of New Yorks own Bill the Butcher Harvey Weinstein) the change hasnt been prepared for. The scenes of conscription are brief and schematic and have no dramatic power; and its never clear how Amsterdam--who has black friends and who has taken no position on the draft--feels about his people suddenly taking on the government. When the federal troops arrive and the cannon balls start flying its out of nowhere. Its as if in Gladiator (2000) Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) began to square off in the Colosseum and suddenly the place was overrun by Visigoths. In its present form anyway Day-Lewis upstages this whole bloody stew of a movie. Its a wondrously overpoweringly weird piece of acting With his perversely deliberate speech patterns Day-Lewis sounds more foreign than any of the so-called foreigners hes fighting and hes not quite human. He squashes his eyes and curls his lower lip under his rolling mustache then leans forward and strides through the sets in his plaid yellow trousers on legs that look like stilts. ""Who does he remind me of?"" I kept asking myself. Then I knew Hes like one of those giant puppets you see in Balinese theater or in left-wing agitprop troupes like the Bread and Puppet Circus. Hes tacky and splendid and scaled to Scorseses dreams. Maybe someday Gangs of New York will emerge with comparable stature.

If Martin Scorseses staggeringly ambitious one-of-a-kind finally has too many flaws to be great it has as much greatness in it as any movie this year. Of all things Scorsese has taken his crack at making a Western by fashioning the screens most visually striking period look of the East full of underground candlelit taverns that arent all that far away from Mexican cantinas. This is a Civil War-era New York weve all read about -- Tammany Hall pretty pickpockets pigs running in the street -- but rarely seen in films and never on this scale. Movie review Gangs of New York ( out of four) Stars Leonardo DiCaprio Cameron Diaz Daniel Day-Lewis Jim Broadbent Liam Neeson John C. Reilly Henry Thomas Director Martin Scorsese Distributor Miramax Rating R for intense violence sexuality/nudity and language Opens Friday nationwide But wait. Does this almost 3-hour epic still feel like a miniseries edited down? Frustratingly yes. Does Leonardo DiCaprio as a vengeful turk caught up in Irish-immigrant gang wars have more adversarial chemistry with Daniel Day-Lewis than romantic chemistry with pocket-picker Cameron Diaz? Conceded. But wait again. Does this compromised giant packed with just-give-it-the-Oscar production design look and feel like any movie ever made? An emphatic no as we wallow in its period hypnotism. Unrecognizable Day-Lewis decked out in a stovepipe hat plus a mustache that makes him look like a member of the 1972 Oakland Athletics is another major Oscar contender playing a professional butcher who also maims the flesh of enemies from rival gangs. Ruling his rotted share of the 1846-63 Apple when it was still a stem he presides over Tammanys affably corrupt Boss Tweed (a superb Jim Broadbent) and finally during the famed Draft Riots launched by those who couldnt afford the 300 fee to avoid Civil War conscription. Gangs has one hour of exposition (though even its very first scene rocks) and a truncated finale that begs for a longer directors cut. The middle 75 minutes -- as brooding DiCaprio sizes up Day-Lewis who killed his father (Liam Neeson) -- hints at the masterpiece that could have been. Historians will pick apart Gangs for years. (With most current movies why bother?) The reason For all its lack of breathing room -- its a rare 3-hour movie that needs more -- it realistically puts you into the Civil War North as much as Gone With the Wind does with the romantically idealized South.

Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis left) and the revenge-minded Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) in director Martin Scorseses ""Gangs of New York."" Warring of the green / Scorsese gets his Irish up in Gangs of New York 1 / 2 Back to Gallery GANGS OF NEW YORK Drama. Starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Daniel Day-Lewis. Directed by Martin Scorsese. (R. 166 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) New York is a city with many pasts. The graceful Colonial period the opulent 1890s the jazz- and gin-soaked 1920s -- these eras came and went and yet live on in monuments in literature and in the public imagination. But another past has been forgotten and thats what director Martin Scorsese has re-created in ""Gangs of New York."" With a meticulousness both loving and obsessive he has resurrected an era thats been buried under concrete for the past century and a half -- the gangland days of the mid-19th century. Its the movies one great achievement and cant be dismissed. Scorsese takes us to a New York we never knew existed and shows us so much we can almost smell it. He also never bores us and in a 166-minute movie thats not a small thing either. Yet for all the epic size and epic investment ""Gangs of New York"" lacks the one quality that might have tipped it into greatness -- an epic grandeur. Though big in size ""Gangs"" isnt big in ideas. The lavish setting just lends color to what turns out to be a very simple story. Its a Scorsese movie so beginning with a brawl feels right. Its 1846 and a gang of American natives meet in the town square carrying knives and pikes to do battle with a gang of Irish immigrants. Within minutes the snow is pink with blood and the Irish leader Vallon (Liam Neeson) is dead. The victorious natives are led by Bill the Butcher played by Daniel Day-Lewis who wears a villains black mustache and acts nothing like any Day-Lewis weve ever seen onscreen. Indeed the first time we hear him speaking in an outlandish proto-New York accent theres a tendency to pull back in disbelief. Day-Lewis has made some bold choices in creating this character in speech and manner but it doesnt take long to realize that his Bill the Butcher is a mini-masterpiece a glorious and uncouth sadist who keeps jolting the movie to life. When Day- Lewis is onscreen theres no other actor worth looking at. He certainly overshadows the ostensible leading man Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Vallons son Amsterdam. As a child Amsterdam witnessed his fathers death. As a man he plans to avenge it and to do so he worms his way into Bill the Butchers inner circle. Theres nothing inadequate about DiCaprios acting but next to Day-Lewis he looks lumpish and fuzzy. Watching him in ""Gangs"" one wonders if we may be seeing another example of the Jackie Coogan syndrome -- a genius as a youngster who grows into an unremarkable adult. The movie is at its best in developing the relationship between Bill and Amsterdam. By 1862 Bill controls the section of Lower Manhattan known then as ""the Five Points."" He has absolute power but hes also on the wrong side of history -- against immigration namely Irish immigration -- and hes getting surly. In one scene he slams a knife into a friends hand during a card game and hes alarmingly adept at cutting up slabs of pork in his butcher shop/office. But he takes a liking to Amsterdam and that brings out his seductive charm. Amsterdam needs a father. Bill needs a son. And so Amsterdam has a conflict Hes beginning to like the most awful man he knows. The compelling setup is diluted somewhat by the introduction of Cameron Diaz as Jenny an Irish pickpocket and con woman. Diaz would be out of place in a movie set in 1962 but as a woman in 1862 shes like a neon sign flashing the word anachronism. The romance of Jenny and Amsterdam plays like a dance between two lightweights box office candy unworthy of Scorsese and filler in a movie that needs none. There are more important things for Scorseses camera to be recording. The sights we do get are memorable immigrants arriving on the dock being hustled by Tammany recruiters working for Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent). A ship pulling in during night covered from bow to stern with the wooden coffins of Civil War dead. Yet even when the blood starts running ankle deep in the streets -- in a graphic depiction of New Yorks famous draft riots -- theres something small about ""Gangs of New York"" that keeps it from ever feeling like what it was meant to be a panoramic view of a world and a time. Maybe the father-son gang story was too little and personal to hang an epic on. Or maybe some essential element didnt make the final edit while Diaz did. In any case ""Gangs of New York"" is still something to see and it has its impact. I doubt Ill ever be able to look at a smirking fellow in old daguerreotype with rolled-up sleeves and a mustache and not think of Daniel Day-Lewis and all that vitality lost to time. . This film contains graphic violence and nudity.

The raised lids belong to Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) leader of the Dead Rabbits a gang on 1846 New Yorks Lower East Side in whose blood - theyre Irish and Catholic - courses the quickening immigrant vitality that is beginning to transform not only New York City but also all of young America. The falling lid covers an orb of glass with a pupil in the shape of a bald eagle the patriotic affectation of William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) leader of the anti-immigration anti-Catholic gang that call themselves the Native Americans a quick-tempered rabble that would keep out the hordes arriving daily if they could. They try but they cant. Although Priest dies in the struggle - early in a cinematic showdown that concentrates all of the directors notions of human violence into one roaring circus of carnage - his son who will grow up to call himself Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) will emerge to take his place and continue what his father began. The curtain is coming down on the Butchers isolationist kind. And all the fight theyve got in them cant fend off change. Thats the thematic summary of ""Gangs"" told in a blink - New Yorks (and Americas) past ceding violently to the future shaping the character of the present. But summary doesnt capture the hubbub and tumult of this dark hectic hard-born showpiece a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any Scorsese has ever given us. If I could convince myself that in its mess and untamed intensity ""Gangs of New York"" means to iterate the ungainly shape of the very history it recounts then Id be able to say this movie is towering and profound. Since I cant - because it groans and lumbers over too many ruts of narrative didacticism and murky puddles of historical matter as often as it explodes with scenes of greatness - Im stuck with calling it only (only) intermittently extraordinary. Perhaps whats most extraordinary of all is that Daniel Day-Lewis was prevailed on to come out of self-imposed seclusion to chomp into the role of the Butcher with such savage gusto. The complicated and brilliant Day-Lewis makes all of old New York come alive; hes the furnace that stokes the story and he gives off real exciting heat even if hes just standing in one of Sandy Powells fantastically circusy costumes (topped by the highest of high hats) cocking his dark head and hmmmpffing his ornate words in the sinewy genuine accent of native old New York. Day-Lewis personified a very different kind of old New York for Scorsese in ""The Age of Innocence""; Gotham suits him and his passion for self-reinvention. The Butcher rules the now-gone Lower Manhattan neighborhood called the Five Points with fear showmanship and a furious belief in the right of his dominion. And as he always does Scorsese has some of his blackest fun staging scenarios in which class and power clash. Bill the Butcher is a murderous brute and yet politicos (embodied by Jim Broadbent as the audaciously corrupt Boss Tweed) court him daintily. Likewise Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz overmatched through no fault of her own by the better-drawn characters of her costars) is a talented con-artist pickpocket who can work uptown or down charming unsuspecting wealthy gentlemen out of the goods in their fancy waistcoats. (In the tedious way of romantic subplots fastened onto historical dramas Jenny must fall in love with Amsterdam sometime after picking his pocket.) Every resident in the whole grimy mosaic of Scorseses Olde Big Apple - the thieves and the reformers the poor and the dirt-poor - knows how to needle the guy next to him. And yet thats still not enough for this restless filmmaker. So wired is he to keep talking that the overfussed script by Jay Cocks Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan jams the history of abolition and Union Army conscription and the Draft Riots of 1863 into the movies overloaded last stretch. (The sure sign of storytelling trouble Amsterdam is suddenly called upon to provide a lot of explanatory voice-over.) For all his symbolic importance as a young man raised in an orphans workhouse who hides his identity in adulthood to get closer to his sworn enemy DiCaprio doesnt have that much to do in ""Gangs of New York."" Returned to the place where his father died in order to avenge that death Amsterdam is meant to be the embodiment of revolution - the forebear of modern New York. To use some of the historic idiom larded into the dialogue he doesnt have the sand for it. Scorsese? Now hes got sand to spare. He long wrestled with this big movie fought over it sometimes took blows for it and kept on swinging. Hes a New York gang of one.

Story Tools RELATED  Golden Globe nominations announced  Gangs of New York  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.com Movie reviews (CNN) -- Its been 30 years in the making but Martin Scorsese has created a cinematic masterpiece with ""Gangs of New York."" The legendary director lured Daniel Day-Lewis out of his self-imposed retirement nabbed Leonardo DiCaprio for one of his first major film roles since ""Titanic"" in 1997 and topped it off with signing one of the industrys hottest female stars Cameron Diaz. He then swept them away to Rome for months of intense production. The result is a grand American epic a genre Scorsese has never attempted before. What is not new for Scorsese is the setting of the story. New York City has always been his muse and ""Gangs"" is no exception. However instead of the mean streets of modern day Gotham this tale takes place between the 1840s and the 1860s. During that time in U.S. history Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine were flooding into New York by the thousands. There to greet them were gangs of ""native Americans"" -- translation any Western Europeans who had immigrated earlier. Street battles inner conflict Both groups settled into the Five Points section of Manhattan a cesspool of corrupt politicians street crime dirt disease and poverty. Even Charles Dickens on a visit to the city was amazed at the ""filth and dirt and drunken frays."" The tensions between the ""native Americans"" and the Irish often broke out into violent street battles leaving many dead or wounded. One such battle results in the death of an Irishman named Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) at the hands of a local thug named William Cutter a.k.a. ""Bill the Butcher"" (Day-Lewis). Witnessing the death is Vallons young son Amsterdam. The boy helpless to intervene swears future vengeance for the murder of his father. DiCaprio plays a young man coping with his desire for revenge. The story flashes forward 20 years and young Amsterdam is now a grown man played by DiCaprio. Cutter is now fully in control of Five Points and every year on the anniversary of Vallons death he commemorate his victory over the Irishman. Amsterdams plan is to get close to Cutter and then kill him at the height of his celebration in full view of everyone. While biding his time Amsterdam works his way deeper and deeper into Cutters inner circle. At the same time Amsterdam meets Jenny Everdeane (Diaz) a beautiful pickpocket with a fiery temper and a strong sense of independence. He falls in love but to his horror he discovers that Jenny and Cutter have a common past. Its one more link with the bloody ""Butcher"" and not a link he wants to have. At this point Amsterdam becomes torn. He finds himself falling under Cutters spell. But while he struggles with his inner conflict his true identity is revealed. The young man suddenly realizes that the Irish have overwhelming numbers against the ""native Americans"" and grabs his destiny becoming the leader of the Irish in Five Points. At this same time in history the Civil War is raging and many immigrants are drafted into service for a country in which they have barely arrived while others buy their way out of the draft. Against this backdrop the showdown between the ""Butcher"" and Amsterdam -- and the films climax -- is set in motion. Believable story believable performances Scorsese is at the peak of his powers with ""Gangs Of New York."" From ""Mean Streets"" to ""Taxi Driver"" to ""Goodfellas"" Scorsese has been fascinated with stories about survival against all odds and ""Gangs"" fits the bill. Scorsese is not only a highly-skilled director hes also a historian and this story has been expertly researched down to the tiniest details. It feels totally authentic throughout. The camera work and the editing are astounding. This is a highly violent film but you never really see the violence due to the expert editing. And the directors use of a steadicam to provide the points of view of his characters as they travel the filthy streets is extremely effective. DiCaprio gives a strong expert and totally believable performance as Amsterdam. He has emerged from his ""Titanic"" heartthrob image as an adult with enormous range and power. Not since ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape"" (1993) has he given a performance of this depth. In combination with ""Catch Me If You Can"" its a sure bet that 2003 will be a very good year for the 28-year-old actor. Day-Lewis also turns in a spectacular performance as ""Bill the Butcher."" He reportedly stayed in character throughout the production which had to have been strange to say the least but its his usual mode of operation when making a film. Diaz basically plays ""the girlfriend"" here but she has some strong scenes and pulls them off expertly. She also manages to remain beautiful under all that dirt and grime required for a pickpocket from Five Points. Scorsese has been up for the Best Director Oscar three times and three times he has lost. Hopefully hell get a fourth shot. He also has a chance at a Golden Globe. ""Gangs"" is nominated for best drama and he is nominated for best director. Special note Look for Scorsese -- and his wife and children -- in the film as a wealthy Upper East Side family having dinner in their plush townhouse. ""Gangs of New York"" opens nationwide on Friday December 20 and is rated R with a running time of 168 minutes.

The year is 1846 and two hostile local militias are fighting for control of Five Points a lumpen corner of downtown Manhattan crawling with vice criminality and Darwinian struggles for survival. On one side are scores of newly arrived Irish Catholics headed by ""Priest"" Vallon (Liam Neeson) the gladiatorial chieftan of the wonderfully named Dead Rabbits gang; on the other scores of viciously anti-immigrant Nativists led by vicious flamboyant William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) who sports a glass eye with a blue American eagle instead of an iris. As the two gangs face off Paradise Square lies before them covered with snow the better to show off the blood. The ragtag soldiers begin their headlong charge -- bashing skulls with iron pipes and shillelaghs slashing away with knives and razors chopping into flesh with hatchets and cleavers -- until the trampled snow is tinted a deep ghastly pink. This battle is just the first of many gruesome bloodlettings in this teeming tale of underclass life in Civil War-era New York. Loosely based on the lively (and often spurious) 1928 book by Herbert Asbury Gangs of New York is a labor of love for Scorsese whos spent the last quarter-century preparing to conjure up this tumultuous moment of his beloved citys past. This is no piece of clock punching like Bringing Out the Dead. Rather from the lavish density of his re-created Manhattan (built at Romes Cinecitta studios) to his bold attempt to make history pack the wallop of myth Scorsese is playing for the highest stakes. Gangs of New York aspires to be the great immigrant epic of the 19th century a film with the reach and emotional resonance of those later historical epics based in New York the first two Godfathers and Once Upon a Time in America. Its a noble ambition but Scorsese and his writers (Jay Cocks Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan) have saddled their dream with a corny plot apparently lifted from some old 1930s Warner Bros. film starring Jimmy Cagney and Pat OBrien. The story proper begins in 1862 when Vallons son Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) gets out of the so-called House of Reform on Blackwells Island and returns to Five Points to exact revenge on the man who 16 years earlier killed his father Cutting a philanthropic gangster (he doles out free meat) whose thugs now control that turf. Before he quite knows whats happening Amsterdam has been sucked into Cuttings gaudy orbit. He becomes the Butchers favorite henchman almost a surrogate son and finds himself falling for another of Cuttings proteges the plucky young pickpocket Jenny Everdeane (played by a badly miscast Cameron Diaz whose period garb and frizzed-up red hair cant disguise an essence thats pure SoCal moderne). While friends wonder if his will to revenge is weakening Amsterdam quietly awaits his moment of reckoning with Bill the Butcher. GANGS OF NEW YORK IS NARRATED CLUNKILY by Amsterdam one of those oddly passive heroes who were supposed to think tough even though they spend most of their time observing the other characters. Although he appears to have a lot to do (avenge his murdered father resurrect the Dead Rabbits romance a good-looking woman) hes no Michael Corleone; his character is so thinly conceived that it would take a great performance to put blood in the young pips veins. Even hiding his boyishness with a leather cap and a beard (well sort of) the soft-chinned DiCaprio is too wispy a screen presence to hold up the business end of a two-fisted epic (though the same evanescence makes him perfect for Spielbergs Catch Me If You Can). As an actor hes always been better at wet-eyed sensitivity than vibrant virility and here he spends most of his time being overshadowed by the charismatic Day-Lewis who looks as if he could swat the young punk away like a horsefly.

Aug. 15 705pm Of course reactionary villains are almost always a blast -- theyre pumped full of juice by their hatreds -- and Day-Lewis clearly relishes Cutting whose looming top hat sanguinary waistcoat and handlebar mustache give him the air of a psychopathic Mad Hatter. Its a funny scary hugely theatrical role -- an old-school De Niro role really -- and after a voluntary five-year absence from the screen Day-Lewis seizes it with an eager bravado which makes you suspect that repairing shoes may not be the road to contentment after all. Whether tapping his incongruously mobile glass eye with a knife-point using a strung-up pigs carcass to teach Amsterdam the art of the quick kill or launching into a melancholy remembrance of his old nemesis Priest Vallon (""the last honorable man"") Butcher Bill is a huge contradictory soul whos never more dangerous than when he thinks hes being amusing. But his dominating presence skews the whole picture. The only performers who can stand up to Day-Lewis primal force are Jim Broadbent who endows Tammany Halls vote-grubbing Boss Tweed with an affably sidelong cunning and bullish Brendan Gleeson the great Irish actor much of whose compelling role as a street fighter with 44 notches on his cudgel seems to have vanished onto the cutting-room floor. Over the years Scorseses work has become famous for its dazzling technique but here his visual style lacks its customary pop. Perhaps hes slightly overwhelmed by production designer Dante Ferrettis simulacrum of old New York which achieves an exhausting richness of detail Its a swirl of churning streets Chinese operas dingy hop houses political offices filled with caged birds fancy uptown billiards rooms vast multileveled tenements whose missing walls make them look like Olympian beehives. Virtually every shot contains something enjoyable to look at (Sandy Powells costumes are vaudeville Dickens) but at times Scorsese seems too in love with his fabulous sets. Who cares about the facade of a whorehouse if Diazs Jenny is going to dwindle into a ministering adornment in the third hour? Who wouldnt gladly swap Scorseses pointless use of slow-mo for more attention to nuances of character? Near the end Cutting commits a murder that profoundly violates everything we know about his strict moral code yet the script seems not to notice. Like so many long-nurtured projects -- think of Polanskis Pirates or Coppolas Tucker -- the movie feels stillborn from its extended labor. Then again what ultimately gives Gangs of New York its power is less its storytelling than its grand bracingly radical vision of American history. Like Hugh Hudson in his unfairly reviled Revolution Scorsese reminds us that our freedoms were won in the streets by common people and that these freedoms did not come cheap. The movie evokes the overwhelming cruelty of a 19th-century America in which millions of Northerners hated Lincolns obsession with ""niggers"" Irish immigrants worked themselves to death for pennies in sweatshops the poor were forced to become Civil War cannon fodder while the rich paid 300 a head to avoid conscription high society practiced its lethal niceties with supreme politesse (as Scorsese chronicled in The Age of Innocence) and Boss Tweed preached his homegrown version of realpolitik ""You can always hire one half of the poor to kill off the other half."" ALL THESE SOCIAL FORCES COME TO A HEAD-on collision in Gangs of New Yorks explosive climax in which Scorseses panoptic vision of the tribalized city comes close to achieving the richness hes been striving for since the opening minutes. Even as the Dead Rabbits and the Nativists begin yet another headlong confrontation anti-draft rioters rampage through the streets of upper Manhattan attacking the rich and lynching blacks; Union soldiers fire indiscriminately into the crowds slaughtering anyone unlucky enough to be in range; and the politicians calculate as always how to turn all this death and destruction to electoral advantage. These 1863 Draft Riots were the most devastating in American history yet -- caught up in their personal duel -- Amsterdam Vallon and William Cutting continue their blood feud oblivious that their small local battle is being drowned out by the cymbal clash of history. In quieter days Bill the Butcher once sat by Amsterdams bedside and predicted the end of the world he held dear. ""Civilization"" he intoned sadly ""is crumbling."" What he did not foresee but what Scorseses final images make clear is that modern America was forged in a cataclysm of rage chaos bloodshed and dreams.

""Gangs of New York"" bears all the earmarks of a magnum opus for Martin Scorsese Fascinating and fresh material about his beloved New York City an epic reach an equally epic gestation period a dynamic criminal element combustible socio-political-religious elements outstanding actors and sophisticated allusions to cinema history that inform and enrich the experience. The enormously ambitious picture that has emerged after some 30 years of on-and-off effort and more than two years of production falls somewhat short of great film status but is still a richly impressive and densely realized work that bracingly opens the eye and mind to untaught aspects of American history. An aggressive marketing campaign by Miramax with an emphasis on the big names atop the cast and the attendant publicity surrounding release of the long-awaited production will assure a strong commercial start and any awards bounty will help. But as it almost always has with Scorsese films the mass public will likely resist the violence and tough unsentimental stance of the picture resulting in hard-won midrange B.O. Having examined the rarefied stratum of New York society so meticulously in ""The Age of Innocence"" nearly a decade ago Scorsese uses the hook of gang warfare among the citys lowest classes in the 1860s to illuminate such fascinating pertinent and generally ignored topics as mass immigration political corruption prejudice the nations first military conscription (which could be avoided by the wealthy for 300) the hostility toward Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War by major groups in the North and the 1863 Draft Riots the worst in American history. In this respect alone watching the film written by Jay Cocks Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan and inspired by Herbert Asburys anecdotal 1928 chronicle of the same name is akin to seeing the history book shaken free of dust and instead coursing with blood. And blood does play a big part in it beginning with a frighteningly violent and -- with accelerated action and electronic guitar intrusions -- sometimes aesthetically jarring initial 15-minute setpiece that pits the American-born Nativists led by William Cutting aka ""Bill the Butcher"" (Daniel Day-Lewis) against the despised Dead Rabbits gang of recently arrived Irish Catholics led by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). Brandishing blades of every size and shape the dozens of urban warriors gruesomely hack one another to bits until Bill manages to nail his prime adversary and assume control over the seedy and dangerous area on Manhattans Lower East Side known as the Five Points. Witnessing the massacre is Vallons young son who disappears for 16 years of tough learning at the Hellgate House of Reform before slipping back into the Five Corners in 1862. Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) a husky circumspect type has his sights set on revenge but is faced with a Bill the Butcher who has become the cock of the walk a lean preening gent in waistcoat and stovepipe hat who has lost none of his viciousness ""Each of the Five Points is a finger and when I close my hand it becomes a fist"" Bill warns. For all its points of interest about the workings of Tammany Hall and the endlessly corrupt William ""Boss"" Tweed (Jim Broadbent) the early expository material comes off as somewhat sloppy and compressed which delays the picture from getting squarely on track. Hoping to blend in Amsterdam confirms his identity only to old friend Johnny (Henry Thomas) and accompanies him on a job at Bills behest. He ventures briefly into ""Age of Innocence"" territory when he follows pickpocket and fellow Five Points orphan Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz) uptown where she wears fancy clothes in order to enter and rob the homes of rich families (one presided over by Scorsese in a brief cameo). Spirited feisty resourceful and skilled at survival Amsterdam and Jenny clearly are two of a kind but she blows him off for the moment. Given the scrupulousness of pics approach and the vast canvas to be painted the setting-up takes the better part of an hour. But pic hits its stride in the middle rounds as Bill whos never had a son of his own embraces Amsterdam as a protege teaching him the tricks of his bloody trade (his demonstration of knifing techniques on a pig carcass is classic). For his part Amsterdam keeps his own counsel and bides his time coming to increasingly value his relationship with his boss. In a superb sequence set at a performance of ""Uncle Toms Cabin"" that includes an actor playing President Lincoln being ridiculed and pelted by the audience Amsterdam saves Bill from an assassins bullet. This earns him a place by Bills side as they relax at a bordello-cum-opium den but Amsterdam uses the occasion to finally consummate his edgy relationship with Jenny. In a wonderfully blunt understated monologue Bill confides in Amsterdam quietly acknowledging how Priest Vallon was the only man he killed whom he respected and how fear is the tool he uses to preserve order. ""Civilization is crumbling"" Bill laments -- and so thoroughly has his character been developed in the writing and by Day-Lewis sensational performance that ironic is it may be its perfectly clear how the remark represents the truth from this arch-criminals point of view. Even after Jenny reveals to her new lover the extent of her past relationship with Bill Amsterdam still cant afford to open up. But his true identity soon is betrayed to Bill who comes within a whisker of killing his presumed disciple before disfiguring him and sending him away. Thus is the way paved for Amsterdams long convalescence a la Brando in ""One Eyed Jacks"" and his preparation to avenge his fathers killing once and for all. The inevitability of this dramatic trajectory is finessed by the tumultuous events that otherwise dominate pics third act notably the building tension between Bill and Boss Tweed over the growing Irish population which the Democratic politician views as a fertile ground for votes. By 1863 the two have fallen out so completely that Tweed is convinced by Amsterdam now the Irish communitys emboldened leader to run an Irishman and old friend of Priest Vallons (played by Brendan Gleeson) for sheriff with devastating results. Preparations for the climactic ""rumble"" between Bills ""Native Americans"" and Amsterdams resurgent Dead Rabbits are intercut with the onset of the Draft Riots which engulfed the entire city and in real life lasted for four days and nights. Ambitious attempt to balance the macro and micro aspects of history is managed pretty well if not with magisterial confidence and a quiet sequence of cityscape shots at the very end will insure a reflective audience posture upon exit. There is no mistaking what Scorsese is attempting here -- a grand historical/political/romantic epic that places memorable characters against a rich cultural backdrop in the manner of ""The Leopard"" ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America."" By these standards the shortcomings of ""Gangs of New York"" are evident -- uneven pacing lack of full integration of secondary characters intermittent over-eagerness to create an effect for effects sake uncertain tone in Amsterdams V.O. narration compared to the pungency of much of the dialogue. Still there are many aspects of ""Gangs"" that could justify analyses of their own. The research that by necessity went into re-creating the vanished and meagerly documented area has paid off in a surpassingly physical way first and foremost in Dante Ferrettis extraordinary production design constructed at Romes Cinecitta Studios. Beginning with the underground caves from which emerge Priest Vallon and his son in the films opening shots and moving on to the zoo-like tenement cages inhabited by the fresh batch of immigrants the wonderfully individuated offices of Bill and Tweed a ""Shanghai Gesture""-like Chinese entertainment emporium and the massive web of exterior streets Ferrettis work is a surpassing wonder. Then there are Sandy Powells colorfully eccentric and exaggerated but somehow convincing costumes the barrelful of source music that dominates a soundtrack filled out by Howard Shores mostly effective but occasionally intrusive score the blessed scarcity of CGI shots and the energetic mobility of Michael Ballhaus cinematography. At the same time it must be said that the shots on the whole lack the compositional boldness elegance and visual grace of the best of the six Scorsese-Ballhaus collaborations particularly ""Age of Innocence."" The depiction of the historical political and ethnic/racial aspects of the era undoubtedly will be assessed and buffs will delight in citing references and sources of inspiration which run the gamut from D.W. Griffiths original New York gang film the 1912 ""The Musketeers of Pig Alley"" to Samuel Fullers crime mellers ""House of Bamboo"" and ""Underworld U.S.A."" Just one example of the films staggering resourcefulness lies in the vast array of accents used by the 100-plus actors with speaking parts. There are hints in Day-Lewis speech patterns of what has come to be known as a ""New York accent"" but theres a grand articulate quality to it as well that sets it apart. DiCaprio plausibly adopts a light Irish lilt while there are some Hibernians who speak no English at all only Gaelic. Normally one doesnt take note of a films dialogue coach but the man on the spot here Tim Monich deserves kudos for his extraordinarily attentive work. A scary galvanizing presence here with his massive moustache and chops plastered-down hair and one good eye Day-Lewis succeeds in making Bill the Butcher into a surprisingly rounded figure one can understand without ever forgetting his malevolence. Particularly amusing is this minimally educated mans appetite for fancy words which he drops into sentences with poisonous intent. For good measure he sports garb that makes him look even taller than he is and thesp also mastered Robert De Niros sneeringly insincere grin. More robust than before and sporting light whiskers DiCaprio is a dynamic physical and emotional force throughout while Diaz vibrantly plays the redheaded wildcat whose willfulness seems to subside only in the third act when shes suddenly reduced to playing nursemaid for Amsterdam. Only complaint that could be registered about the supporting players is that theyre not given enough to do particularly Gleeson as a taciturn roughneck with 44 kill notches on his club and Thomas effective in limited use as an ambiguous tragic figure. Broadbent Neeson and Reilly the latter as a cop in cahoots with the gangs all sock over their roles with gusto and conviction.
