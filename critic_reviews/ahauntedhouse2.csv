A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Maybe its just as well since 2014 is seeing the release of two movies in the Paranormal Activity franchise so why shouldnt its direct spoof series try to keep up?It may be a low bar but Michael Tiddess A Haunted House 2 is actually an improvement over its predecessor. Though its still a hodgepodge its a more finely-tuned hodgepodge like Marlon Wayans and the producers were more selective when editing the down the hours of improvisation.Film Details A Haunted House 2 RatingR GenreComedy Running Time87 More Info Trailer Essence Atkins (the first films bright spot) is sadly relegated to a cameo and while Jaime Pressly tries her best as the new wife she mostly makes you wish that Wayans had reunited with his old Scary Movie costar Anna Faris.That said A Haunted House 2s supporting cast is much stronger; Gabriel Iglesias mines laughs from predictable ethnic humor and Rick Overtons Skyped-in role as a paranormal expert gets an actual character arc.And though hes not for all tastes theres something admirable about Wayanss willingness to do anything for a laugh often reminiscent of Jerry Lewis at his most frantic.

It is a nervous breakdown. Directed by Michael Tiddes but largely the handiwork of star producer and co-writer Marlon Wayans the film is being billed as yet another Wayans-ized spoof of the horror movie genre a la the first Haunted House movie and the wildly successful Scary Movie series. (Keenen Ivory Wayans and his brothers were responsible for the first two Scary Movie films; they have since left that franchise which may explain why a new one was needed.) And there are some familiar digs at recent horror flicks This time the creepy doll and the closet from The Conjuring the family-murdering demon from Sinister and the dybbuk box from The Possession all make appearances. But this new film is mostly an excuse for star Marlon Wayans to have extended freak-outs in response to the horrors visited upon him -- shrieking screaming crying cowering and occasionally hate-fucking for minutes on end. Yes you read that last bit right. A Haunted House 2 puts the satyriasis back in satire. There are stabs at other types of humor here -- including a couple of decent bits about racial sensitivity to stereotypes mostly involving Wayanss next-door neighbor a Mexican gardener played by comic Gabriel Iglesias. (The characters full name is Miguel Jose Jesus Gonzalez Smith but he dropped the ""Smith"" from his business name because well ""Would you trust your yard work to a guy named Smith?"") But everything in A Haunted House 2 is bulldozed by the stars preening ever stranger freak-outs stitched together with jump-cuts that are supposed to be evocative of the ""found-footage"" genre but come off mostly as slapdash salvage jobs. But to be fair Wayanss desire to push these in-your-face breakdowns into ever stranger territory occasionally yields the most twisted of chuckles. Theyre so wildly indulgent that initially they gather a discomfiting energy all their own. When he first encounters the creepy doll Wayans starts talking to it then makes it masturbate itself then he eats it out then he screws it then he chokes it and ... well it gets weirder (and sicker) from there. (I wont lie; I laughed at the part where he made the doll eat him out.) That this extended debauchery is later mirrored by a scene where our hero tries to destroy the doll -- chopping it up into little pieces and burning it among other things -- will no doubt one day make this film riveting viewing at psychiatric conferences. Unfortunately the whole thing gets old awfully quickly. The film hasnt been conceived with any care given to where it goes so that Wayans blows both his proverbial and his literal load in those early scenes with the doll; the later freak-outs dont quite compare. And there are only so many sex jokes you can make before the audience pretty much knows where everything is headed. When our heros girlfriends oversexed teenage daughter starts to choke on something you pretty much know its going to turn out to be a haunted penis lodged in her esophagus. (I realize I might be making this movie sound better than it is and for that I apologize.) Unfortunately the most predictable thing about A Haunted House 2 will certainly be A Haunted House 3. The movie looks so abysmally cheap that Im pretty sure it turned a profit on my ticket sale alone. In the meantime the writers and directors of this years slate of horror flicks should be sure to include as many fuckable elements as they can in their films. We wouldnt want Marlon Wayans to run out of ideas.

Credit Will McGarry/Open Road Films Run in fright. Marlon Wayanss comedy ""A Haunted House"" unaccountably made 40 million at the domestic box office so we have ""A Haunted House 2"" which like its predecessor pays parodic tribute to horror films including ""Dark Skies"" and the ""Last Exorcism"" movies among countless others. Already the franchise displays a sputtering exhaustion.Malcolm (Mr. Wayans) is moving into a home with his new girlfriend Megan (Jaime Pressly) since his amour from ""A Haunted House"" the demonically possessed Kisha (Essence Atkins briefly seen here) has died in a car wreck. Megan has a young son the innocent-looking but foulmouthed Wyatt (Steele Stebbins) and a sexually active teenage daughter Becky (Ashley Rickards). Of course the house has other residents -- Tony Wyatts unseen ghostly playmate (a la ""Paranormal Activity 3"") and Abigail a sinister-looking doll (a la Annabelle in ""The Conjuring"") -- and countless surveillance cameras. Eventually Malcolm enlists his neighbor (the stand-up comic Gabriel Iglesias); married bickering exorcists (Missi Pyle and Hayes MacArthur); and his friend Father Williams (Cedric the Entertainer back from the last installment) to help curtail the annoying visitations.But this is Mr. Wayanss show and his perspiring physicality wide-eyed mugging and relentless pop culture references grow exasperating. One especially tiring device more indicative of a meager budget than of humorous ingenuity is his attacking inanimate objects taking a rifle to a corrugated cardboard box; endlessly tussling in the kitchen with a prop chicken; burning and punching out Abigail with which he has had simulated sex. (He leaves the doll with bruised and swollen eyes.)The tone grows ever more shrill and desperate. ""Ive had enough of this haunted house craziness"" Megan says at one point. Havent we all.""A Haunted House 2"" is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Nudity drug use and simulated doll fornication.

Its not that the Marlon Wayans horror spoof ""A Haunted House 2"" isnt stupid. It is incredibly so as well as technically inept damn near plotless and mired in humor so puerile ugly and regressive that this critic witnessed a gaggle of preteen theater-hoppers groan with exasperation at several of the running sex jokes. And yet theres a certain tragically admirable level of commitment from the cast particularly the dignity-averse Wayans that at least lifts it above the parody-movie nadir set by ""Date Movie""/""Epic Movie"" auteurs Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Its certainly likely to be among the worst movies in wide release this year but its far from the most hateable and that should count for something. A sequel to last years ""A Haunted House"" which grossed 40 million even though it appeared to have been financed with change collected from a shopping mall fountain this sequel finds protagonist Malcolm (Wayans who also co-scripted with Rick Alvarez) moving into a brand-new home with brand-new girlfriend Megan (Jaime Pressly) and her two children (Ashley Rickards Steele Stebbins). Theoretically staged as a found-footage exercise though frequently opting for standard shots with no appreciable increase in quality the film traces Malcolms growing realization that his new house is indeed haunted. Although there are obvious elements imported from recent horror pics like ""Insidious"" ""The Possession"" and ""The Conjuring"" its hard to really call ""A Haunted House 2"" a parody. Parodies generally tend to riff on and comment upon the films and genres theyre sending up while this effort simply uses them as a loose framework on which to hang a rapid-fire barrage of manic heavily improvised setpieces. Long sequences of Wayans battling a chicken slapping at moths or engaging in extremely pornographic coitus with a porcelain doll make the Three Stooges look like Jane Austen but at least they provide some lizard-brain respite from the scripted dialogue which mines most of its punchlines from racial stereotypes sex and -- with disquieting frequency -- domestic and animal abuse. This is in other words truly a bottom-feeding piece of work but its hard not to be fascinated by Wayans sincere lack of self-consciousness as he hurls himself across the set naked spittle dribbling from his mouth screaming and maintaining a constant patter of off-the-cuff babble with the camera inches from his face. Most top-billed actors even lowbrow comedic ones would have betrayed hints of reluctance or shame at some point but Wayans commitment is total almost to the degree of a performance artist. His ceaseless energy gives ""A Haunted House 2"" a weird sort of integrity If nothing else Wayans and director Michael Tiddes appear to have made exactly the movie they wanted to make with no pretense to anything more. Whether they should have bothered is perhaps a matter of taste. Appearing in small roles Cedric the Entertainer fails to entertain in a reprise of his gangster priest character; Latino standup comic Gabriel Iglesias serves to broaden the range of ethnic humor from simple ""see white guys they drive like this"" gags to include Mexican stereotypes as well; and Affion Crockett somehow steals the movie through his repeated almost Yiddish-like pronunciation of the word ""homie.""

C-Avery says April 20 2014 at 137 pm I saw this movie yesterday. It does have its moments; there are some bits that are hilarious and I and my friend howled with laughter. Another amusing aspect is this many of us have grown heartily sick of seeing black people play ""the race card"" left and right and so it was quite fun to see Gabriel Iglesias in the role of a neighbor throw the race card right back in Malcolms face saying things like ""What?? You think just because Im a Mexican I MUST run a gardening service?"" However such back-at-you humor is overdone. The first time was funny as hell; the second time not so much; and the third time annoying- as in ""Yeah we get it; move along already"" Also grossly overdone is the send-up of black/white stereotyping- ""white people dont do this"" and ""black people dont do that""- again it becomes tiresome and repetitive especially in the context of a married couple. If two people have reached the point of marrying and living together they should have got beyond all that ""blacks are like this and whites are like that"" garbage. Finally there is entirely too much of Wayans screaming like a girl from a 1950s B-movie and running around like a chicken with its head cut off babbling inanities in a put-on ""ghetto"" dialect. One or two girly screams per horror are okay but DOZENS of them? No. The movie to a great degree destroys itself with such excesses. At many points its as though the screenwriter thought ""Oh well I cant think of anything really funny to put in here so Ill throw in yet another joke about the purported differences between black people and white people."" In short a serious lack of imagination. Affion Crockett is particularly irksome as Malcoms cousin Ray-Ray jabbering like a meth-head in a contrived and largely unintelligible ""ghetto"" dialect. You really want to slap him upside the head and scream ""Shut the f____ UP already"" Two bright spots are provided by Missi Pyle and Hayes MacArthur who play respectively a psychic named Noreen and her scam artist/pseudo-evangelist husband Ned. Theyre not enough to rescue the movie from its other flaws but they provide a number of good giggles. All in all- having seen how funny the ""Wayans Tribe"" can be I think they need to ban Marlon from ""the tribe"" until he has learned a lot more about comedy than he currently knows. Reply Lanceindmv says April 20 2014 at 1045 am This movie was absolutely horrible I literally asked for my money. I knew I should have went to see Transcendence and snuck into this one. Marlons use of the ""n"" word and Latino stereotypes was degrading uncalled for and just damn late. Clearly he loves to show his bare ass in the movies. Whats next Scary Porn? With such a brilliant family this best that you can do....really? Reply Conner says April 18 2014 at 1020 pm Dear Variety You have no taste in movies Andrew Barker. A haunted house 2 Is a genius spoof. And how dare you say that the film was made with change from a malls wishing fountain I bet change from a wishing fountain is worth more than your years salarie. Reply Fijgre90dcoje09rii49053249 says April 18 2014 at 1140 pm Youre one of those dicks who believe opinion means fact? Reply Eldore says April 19 2014 at 540 am The movie is a big flop - the worst movie ever made. A stupid movie and ignorant movie. I hate the fact that I paid 6 dollars for the movie. I will never go see any of the Wayans movie ever again.

Leaden sequel might offer one or two more laughs than its misbegotten predecessor but its still a lazy and slapdash horror spoof If ""A Haunted House 2"" is a step up from the previous go-round its either because a slightly more talented crew of comic actors are being asked to waste their time or because 2013 offered a better crop of horror films (""The Conjuring"" ""Sinister"" etc.) to be lazily parodied. In any event calling this one an improvement is like saying that being kicked in the shin is better than being punched in the stomach. Either way it hurts. Watch video Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. Make a lot of Trouble in Lets Be Cops Trailer (Video) Marlon Wayans returns as Malcolm moving into yet another dicey piece of real estate with yet another lunatic shrew -- the only kind of woman movies like this know how to portray. This time its Megan (Jaime Pressly too good for this material) who brings along daughter Becky (Ashley Rickards of MTVs ""Awkward"" way too good for this material) and son Wyatt (Steele Stebbins). Becky sleeps around while Wyatt has an imaginary friend who drinks vodka and talks gangsta. Isnt that hilarious? Becky happens upon a mysterious wooden box (as in ""The Possession"") Megan finds a creepy doll (""The Conjuring"") and Malcolm happens upon a cache of disturbing home movies in the attic (""Sinister""). And just like in the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies there are cameras everywhere and the film is divided into chapters like ""Night No. 4"" and so on. Get it? Because like its just like those other movies that you saw And you recognize the reference So its funny Throw in Missi Pyle (way way too good for this material) and Hayes MacArthur as married ghostbusters and Gabriel Iglesias as the Mexican neighbor (who indulges a lot of ""its not racist if were commenting on racism"" wisecracks) and youve got ... well youve got another ""A Haunted House"" a movie that thinks that sex drugs and going to the bathroom are so inherently funny that all you have to do is show them without actually thinking up something resembling a joke. Also read Marlon Wayans to Star in Harmony Korines Twinkle Twinkle Wayans obviously figured out that the one solid laugh from the first movie was the sight of him having passionate sex with stuffed animals so he and returning co-writer Rick Alvarez recycle that bit only this time Wayans has sex with that unnerving doll from ""The Conjuring."" And yes its still amusing but its also still about the only truly outrageous or hilarious thing the movie has to offer. Instead we get the usual parade of topical movie references with a liberal sprinkling of anti-women and anti-gay barbs throughout. Misogyny and homophobia are the fallback positions of Wayans comedies dating at least as far back as ""Mo Money"" and its a family habit that Marlon doesnt seem interested in breaking. Also read Gabriel Fluffy Iglesias Comedy Concert Movie Acquired by Open Road Theres a throwaway gag at one point about how the ""Scary Movie"" franchise isnt funny anymore since the Wayans left.

"No-holds-barred humor is a powerful presence in Haunted House 2 - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now No-holds-barred humor is a powerful presence in Haunted House 2 MCT_ENTER MOVIE-HAUNTED MCT Open Road Films Marlon Wayans in the movie ""A Haunted House 2."" Marlon Wayans in the movie ""A Haunted House 2."" (Open Road Films) Martin Tsai Marlon Wayans is having the last laugh and were laughing with him.He oversaw the fluorescence of the lucrative ""Scary Movie"" franchise with brothers Shawn and Keenen Ivory but they all three unceremoniously sat out the third-fifth installments. In ""A Haunted House 2"" Marlon digs at the post-Wayanses ""Scary"" sequels and lets it be known that he has scores to settle. Aside from references to the more current fright films ""The Conjuring"" ""The Possession"" ""Sinister"" and the ""Insidious"" and ""Paranormal Activity"" series ""A Haunted House 2"" for the most part doesnt reinvent the wheel.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013 As with the original ""A Haunted House"" Wayans Malcolm moves into a new house with a new girlfriend and proceeds to redefine the term ""sex toy"" -- its just a different house girlfriend and toy this time. Notably the originals gay panic has here been supplanted by hang-ups over interracial dating.The films no-holds-barred humor can best be described as ""In Living Color"" without televisions FCC oversight. From Honey Boo Boo to the Kardashians from Chris Brown to Paula Deen from Angry Birds to ""Hoarders"" it spares nothing and no one.Some instances of impiousness work better than others. Wayans parodies the politically incorrect so deftly that Stephen Colbert could use a lesson. Though his edgier waggery on taboo subjects only goes to show that rape child molestation and police brutality simply arent laughing matters.calendarlatimes.com -----------------------A Haunted House 2MPAA rating R for crude and sexual content nudity pervasive language drug use and some violent images.Running time 1 hour 27 minutes.Playing In general release.

Thats how readers respond when I write a negative review of a movie that everyone expected would be bad. In the case of ""A Haunted House 2"" the sequel to Marlon Wayanss horror movie parody I didnt expect much. But I did assume -- this being a comedy and all -- that I would laugh at least once. But ""A Haunted House 2"" is so bombastically stupid that its well-earned R rating doesnt seem sufficient. The movie should come with another warning The following 87 minutes would be better spent alphabetizing your spice rack. Wayans reteamed with Rick Alvarez to write this follow-up and he once again stars as Malcolm a man plagued by otherwoldly forces. He has just moved into a new house with his girlfriend Megan (Jaime Pressly) and her two children and no sooner do they start unpacking boxes but weird things begin to happen. Megans daughter becomes obsessed with a large box she found in her closet while her younger brother picks up an imaginary friend named Tony. Malcolm meanwhile stumbles upon an old film reel of a ghoulish and incompetent demon that cant seem to kill the houses previous occupants. Malcolm also begins an intimate relationship with a creepy doll Megan found in the closet leading to a series of sex scenes that are so graphic with such hardcore language coming from Malcolm that its hard to believe that only one-half of the participants is human. Other setups that are supposed to qualify as funny include the relationship Malcolm has with his Mexican neighbor in which the two trade racist barbs; a ""joke"" about Chris Brown and Rihannas violent past; an accidental puppy murder; and prison rape. If that werent enough the editing is sloppy the narrative is weak and every lame gag goes on twice as long as it should. ""A Haunted House 2"" definitely exceeds expectations but in the worst way possible. No stars R. At area theaters. Contains crude and sexual content nudity pervasive language drug use and some violent images. 87 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

D A Haunted House 2 Genre Horror Comedy; Starring Jaime Pressly Marlon Wayans; Release Date Wide 04/18/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 87; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Open Road Films Posted April 24 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT At the beginning of this unapologetically stupid sequel to A Haunted House Malcolm (Marlon Wayans) gets rid of his possessed ex-girlfriend (Essence Atkins) and moves in with Megan (Jaime Presly) and her out-of-control teen daughter (Ashley Rickards) and tween son (Steele Stebbins). As soon as Malcolm rigs the house with hidden cameras the found-footage-style paranormal occurrences begin A doll straight out of The Conjuring seduces and stalks Malcolm a talking box starts spewing bugs and the demon from Sinister shows up to do some weird menacing stuff. The actual ghosts -- and there are a lot of them -- arent the real villains here. The real bad guy is Wayans the star and writer for assaulting us with witless gratuitous visuals and pointlessly offensive gags. Malcolm doesnt just dismember one family dog he defiles another (and then does the same to a chicken). He gives us way too many flashes of his naked butt and runs through the gamut of easy-target would-be yucks N-word jokes Mexican jokes prison-rape jokes scat jokes pedophilic priest jokes slut-shaming jokes. Im just getting started. You dont walk into a movie like A Haunted House 2 expecting anything remotely scary or serious but you dont expect to walk out feeling a terrible sense of dread either.

TWITTER Marlon Wayans Jaime Pressly and Gabriel Iglesias co-star with support from Cedric the Entertainer in a follow-up to last yearas horror-movie spoof. With the Scary Movie franchise the Wayans brothers tapped into a lucrative vein of lowbrow humor parodying popular horror releases. Marlon Wayans attempted to extend that run with 2013s A Haunted House which tanked with critics but paid off nicely at the box office. While critical response is likely to be replicated on the sequel a 40 million gross may not be given the films tapped-out formula and lack of differentiation from the original. A year after his ex-girlfriend Kisha (Essence Atkins) possessed by a tenacious demon gets summarily dispatched Malcolm (Wayans) prepares to move in with new girlfriend Megan (Jaime Pressly) and her kids Becky (Ashley Rickards) and Wyatt (Steele Stebbins). Next-door neighbor Miguel (Gabriel Iglesias) appears relieved that the house is occupied again but by examining footage from his extensive network of in-home video cameras Malcolm soon discovers that it was never fully vacated after Becky finds a mysterious wooden box in the basement and Megan retrieves a creepy-looking doll in a 19th century dress from an old wardrobe. Meanwhile Wyatt starts developing a fixation on an invisible friend named ""Tony"" who proves highly disapproving of Malcolm. STORY Poseidon Rex Film Review Perhaps that sentiment isnt entirely misplaced as Malcolm becomes inexplicably attracted to the unusual doll called Abigail indulging in a marathon of nasty clandestine sex before calmly explaining to her that hell have to end their relationship since he has a girlfriend already. Abigails not having it however stubbornly returning after Malcolm attempts to banish her from the house. Then theres the strange box which seems to be taking possession of Becky and the home movies that Malcolm discovers featuring some type of hapless demon randomly preying upon the former homeowners. With this basic set of factors in play Wayans and co-screenwriter Rick Alvarez simply push ""repeat"" -- repeatedly. The same gags similar jokes and slavishly derivative situations keep cycling until Megan and Malcolm decide its time to call in the demon-exterminating experts to cleanse their haunted home including Malcolms gun-toting foul-mouthed priestly acquaintance Father Williams (Cedric the Entertainer) and a paranormal investigative couple (Hayes MacArthur Missi Pyle) who spend more time bickering than banishing the spirit thats now possessed Becky. And shes not the only one in need of exorcism -- Kishas back too and shes mad as hell at Malcolm. STORY Kid Cannabis Film Review If it all seems hopelessly confusing no need to worry -- just refer to the movies that Wayans Alvarez and returning director Michael Tiddes continue spoofing with diminishing returns. Paranormal Activity particularly the fourth installment again figures prominently among their targets augmented by frequent references to 2013s The Conjuring which makes for somewhat more creative satire perhaps due to the latters higher incidence of originality. All of the charges leveled against A Haunted House can be repeated regarding the sequel with the added observation that repeating the same formula works best for those with the least imagination -- a sizeable group judging by public response to the original. Wayans performance again relies primarily on mugging it up and outrageous attempts at self-indulgent humor to elicit laughs topped with copious doses of raunchy sexual innuendo and activity. STORY Transcendence What the Critics Are Saying The outcome is usually fairly tiresome but on occasion reaches levels of moderate originality as in an extended sequence involving the miscalculated ""blood sacrifice"" of a live rooster with Iglesias effectively instigating the attendant mayhem. Pressly doesnt get much of a chance to break out of scolding-spouse mode although Rickards and Stebbins as her demon-afflicted kids manage decent variations on familiar characters. Cedric the Entertainers appearance is perhaps the most strained particularly in a motor-mouthed monologue as the misguided priest. Tiddes faces few challenges indulging Wayans slapstick proclivities or replicating the Paranormal Activity-style found-footage aesthetic and multiple-camera setups which editor Tim Mirkovich cuts together with alacrity if not a great deal of creativity.

Its the type of movie that gets dumped into theaters with the intention of simply making enough at the box office and on DVD and cable to justify its low budget. There are almost no redeeming qualities to this movie. It is bad enough to trigger an existential crisis in the heartiest of movie-lovers. Have you ever gone to see a movie on opening night and sat in a theater with three other people who remained nearly silent for almost an hour and a half? Thats exactly what seeing ""A Haunted House 2"" was like although to be fair there was also a mom and her two sons in the theater at one point. She forced them to leave during an extended sex scene between co-writer and star Marlon Wayans and the wooden doll from ""The Conjuring."" To be fair you should probably expect to see a grown man simulate analingus on a prop if you see an R-rated movie these days. ""A Haunted House 2"" like Wayans previous horror spoofs ""Scary Movie"" et al has a narrative cobbled together from recent events in pop culture and the latest horror movies. The movie begins just after the first ""Haunted House"" ended with Malcolm (Wayans) his possessed girlfriend Kisha (Essence Atkins) and his cousin Ray Ray (Affion Crockett) in a car trying to figure out what to do with Kisha. Fast-forward a year later and Malcolm is shacking up with his new girlfriend Megan (Jaime Pressly) and her two kids Becky (Ashley Rickards) and Wyatt (Steele Stebbins). Supernatural stuff starts happening immediately -- all featuring events or totems cribbed from movies like ""Sinister"" and ""The Possession"" -- but no one believes Malcolm. Perhaps its supposed to be ironic since he didnt believe Kisha when it was happening to her? But its hard to really care. The story is a sprawling mess and it feels much much longer than 87 minutes probably because so many of the scenes are just of Wayans reacting to inanimate objects. Wayans and Abigail the doll have uncomfortably long energetic creative sex scenes with pretty graphic pillow talk; they fight she stalks him he kills her he buries her and defecates on the grave she reappears etc. etc. Or theres his dead dog a call back to the first movie. Shiloh Jr. is squished by a falling safe so Malcolm spends what feels like 10 minutes trying to resuscitate the dog bury him sob at his funeral and bury himself alive in the dogs grave. There are endless montages of him and of some of the other characters like his neighbor Miguel (Gabriel Iglesias) and Doug (Cedric the Entertainer) just riffing as if they did a whole bunch of jokes for the outtakes and never got around to picking just one. At best ""A Haunted House 2"" is a vanity project for Wayans who spends a great deal of the movie looking directly into the camera as part of the found footage/cameras everywhere ruse. The first movie had Atkins as Wayans foil and she has enough life in her to carry her own against a hyper comedic actor. The story of the first movie was also simpler; it was a spoof of ""Paranormal Activity"" but the actual heart of the movie was about a couple moving in together for the first time and getting used to each others quirks. Sure there are tons of gross-out jokes in ""A Haunted House"" but there was something a little bit real in there about the scariness of relationships and closeness and being real (and yes farting in front of the person youre sleeping with). And somewhere between the endless pratfalls and freakouts and expletives theres something similar happening here as it pertains to being with a parent and their children and fitting into their family dynamic. ""A Haunted House"" wasnt a fine movie by any stretch of the imagination but it was better than expected and maybe not even that bad. ""A Haunted House 2"" turns everything up to 11; it actually seems physically louder. The racial humor is ubiquitous and tiresome as opposed to the PC-tweaking humor of the first. Theres a lot more sex and its more graphic but more than that the scenes are just dragged out so long that theyre boring. Two minutes of pretending to hump the creepy doll from ""The Conjuring"" is tolerable but after a while you start to wonder if all of these scenes with Wayans and inanimate objects are filler because none of the humans wanted to share the screen with him. A movie like this isnt intelligent about the things it pokes fun of. If you didnt understand their very dubious theory that theres a kernel of truth in every racial stereotype maybe youll get it after Miguel actually does work as a gardener and does drink tequila and does have a cousin with an auto body shop although he called Malcolm out at every turn. And thats just one example The use of ""bitch"" and ""ho"" dont usually faze me but using those as the default nouns for all the women in the movie gets really grating. Its surface-level satire as if Wayans and co-writer Rick Alvarez just thought to themselves it would be cool to have the characters say the ""n"" word a lot because people find it offensive and boy its funny to make those uptight jerks angry. On a serious note the ongoing jokes about male rape are loathsome and tired and totally inexcusable. Just... No. Stop. Wayans and co-writer Rick Alvarez are sticking with the found footage ruse but its almost an afterthought; Malcolm has set up cameras everywhere and carries one with him all the time so every once in a while director Michael Tiddes throws in a hint of a shaky-cam shot for good measure. It stinks to go into a movie and expect to be disappointed but ""A Haunted House 2 is as half-assed as youd expect.

Thats enough to mark it as an improvement over its predecessor a Scary Movie take-off so poky and dull that it played more like a bad festival-circuit art film than a bad lowbrow comedy. However rubbery and manic though A Haunted House 2 still cant overcome star attraction Marlon Wayans severely limited comic skill set. A typical scene consists of a brief setup peppered with broad race jokes and references followed by a change of circumstances and 60 to 90 seconds of improvised reactions from Wayans shot from the same static angle and strung together by jump cuts. Though even the most accomplished improvisers occasionally rely on shtick Wayans simply recycles the same gags; his ""improv"" is all shtick with little riffing and no sense of flow. Over the course of the movie Wayans repeatedly does the following breaks down into hysterical sobbing; says the word ""doo-doo""; inserts awkward disses at his and his co-stars competitors; pulls down his pants (viewers will become very familiar with the sight of Wayans ass cheeks resting snugly on the waistband of his Calvin Klein boxer briefs); and mimes sex with inanimate objects which usually involves pretending to either give or receive a rimjob. The result is almost never funny and after the third or fourth time begins to seem sputtering compulsive and sad. The setups are similarly programmatic repeated until running gags become jogging-in-place gags. Wayans character Malcolm carries on an affair with a possessed 2-foot doll leading to interminable scenes of raunchy man-on-toy sex. Every scene involving Malcolms neighbor Miguel (Gabriel Iglesias) is built around the same ""stereotypes are real"" joke with Miguel pretending to get offended when Malcolm presumes that he works in landscaping or knows someone who runs an auto body shop before acknowledging that yes its true. Malcolms girlfriend Megan (Jaime Pressly) takes every comment he makes personally becoming angry at what she thinks are insinuations that shes fat or a bad mother. One imagines that the script--credited to Wayans and his regular co-writer Rick Alvarez--resembled a diagram. The movies repeat-as-necessary comedy is enlivened by occasional bouts of cartoon weirdness. An early scene in which Malcolm and Megan move into their new house ends with a rope snapping which causes a hitherto unseen Looney Tunes safe to fall and crush their dog. Malcolm lifts the safe discovers that the dog has been flattened into a pancake attempts to revive it using a bicycle pump but over-inflates it sending the dogs balloon-like corpse flying across the street. Cut to a funeral scene in which the grief-stricken Malcolm attempts to bury himself alongside the dogs tiny coffin. Like the moment in which Malcolm and Miguel wreck a kitchen while trying to behead a live rooster or the shot where Malcolm sees a CGI penis crawling up Megans daughters throat the scene is more gonzo than funny but comes as a welcome break from the repetition. One minor detail becomes emblematic of the humors cyclical crappiness A magazine remains in the exact same spot on Malcolms coffee table angled diagonally throughout the whole movie which takes place over the course of two weeks. Its difficult to tell whether the set dresser responsible should have been fired or commended for consistency with the movies overall vibe.

Johnson ""A Haunted House 2"" Kevin C. Johnson ""A Haunted House 2"" Kevin C. Johnson ""A Haunted House 2"" If ever there was a movie that was completely certifiable the ""A Haunted House 2"" is it.This send-up of current horror movies is a go-for-broke hoot a hot mess of a comedy that doesnt have a lick of sense.And knowing that going in adds to the often knee-slapping laughs. The fact the parody exists seems a bit of a surprise. This movie is a sequel no one was anticipating. The original 2013 ""A Haunted House"" was a hit-or-miss affair but its numbers were incredible. The original movie made for less than 3 million grossed 40 million.Cue the sequel.When we last saw Malcolm (Marlon Wayans) from ""A Haunted House"" he and Kisha (Essence Atkins) were battling demons in their new home as Kisha found herself possessed.Kisha is still possessed as the sequel opens but shes no longer Malcolms problem. He has moved on with Megan (Jaime Pressly) her young son Wyatt (Steele Stebbins) and daughter Becky (Ashley Rickards) to start anew in another new house. But its evident early on the ghosts and even Kisha have yet to give up on Malcolm. Strange things begin occurring once again for Malcolm starting with his beloved dogs violent death the discovery of some old VHS tapes featuring a demon snuffing out families and the arrival of a spooky doll that cant be killed.The new film cribs from the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise (once again) as well as ""The Conjuring"" ""The Last Exorcism"" and the less popular ""Sinister"" the Ethan Hawke horror flick from 2012. Some viewers may not get the heavy ""Sinister"" references but it wont matter.Cedric the Entertainer as a priest and Affion Crockett as Malcolms homie are back for more fun with Gabriel Iglesias among those added to the fold. Much of it sounds like the original ""A Haunted House"" and it is. Still this time around director Michael Tiddes and writer Wayans (with Rick Alvarez) really went for the jokes not caring who got knocked over in the process.Its crudeness isnt for everyone but for fans who care this ones a doozy.What ""A Haunted House 2""  Three stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 126  Content Rude and sexual content nudity pervasive language drug use and some violent images Kevin C.

JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 18 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 18 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Michael Tiddes Written by Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez Starring Marlon Wayans Jaime Pressly Essence Atkins and Cedric the Entertainer Classification 14A Year 2014 Country USA Language English Last year American poet and critic Kenneth Goldsmith wrote a treatise titled Being Dumb.In it Goldsmith outlined the differences between smart smart smart dumb and dumb dumb. Basically smart smart is NPR and The New Yorker; smart dumb is punk rock and Samuel Beckett; dumb dumb is ""rednecks and racists football hooligans gum-snapping marketing girls and thick-necked office boys."" Johnny Depp plays Will Caster a scientist who uploads his brain into an artificial intelligence. Video Video Weekend movie pick Johnny Depp is almost too good at acting lifeless in Transcendence Don Draper played by Jon Hamm in a publicity shot for season 7 of Mad Men. AMC Multimedia Mad Men recap The winners and losers of the season premiere Bracketing Goldsmiths dips into classism and thick-neck prejudice (its hereditary man) his distinctions are instructive. Smart dumb means possessing the tools of distinction and the savvy to know when to employ them. Smart dumb is cool. Smart dumb is being able to enjoy a Whopper if not as a hamburger then at least as an idea. And in film comedy as in life smart dumb is the ideal. When Monty Python or Tim and Eric make a scatological joke its a joke on the idea of that kind of joke.This is not to say that A Haunted House 2 the latest comedy-horror parody film/cultural concern from writer/producer/star Marlon Wayans is smart dumb. Its not even dumb dumb. Its boringly macho - from the cartoonish sex scene acrobatics to Wayanss tendency to flex his well-honed middle-aged man bod at every turn. And racist. And sexist. And homophobic. And when it makes a scatological joke its not even just a scatological joke. Its just scatology.A Haunted House 2 is so dreadful that it demands its own category of dumbness. Theres no way to even resuscitate it within the exalting framework of smart dumb. Theres no blinkered grad student writing a thesis called Post-Comedy and the Cinema Of Marlon Wayans. Theres no disingenuous French cinephile club that wants to mount a retrospective of Scary Movie White Chicks and Little Man. Theres nothing to elevate nothing to admire. Here a penis is a ""dingding"" a vagina a ""box."" Even the prospect of eviscerating A Haunted House 2 as some new nadir in the ongoing Plunge of Popular Taste feels laughably pointless like stopping on the street to sternly dress down a piece of dog plop for being precisely what it is.Like its predecessor A Haunted House 2 takes its cues from passably popular horror movies (The Conjuring Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones) and a splattering of other pop-culture bric-a-brac (Breaking Bad the Kardashians) to broadly lampoon the culture it relies on for its punchlines. This is a film that trusts that words such as ""Kanye"" and ""Craigslist"" and ""mojito"" have some inherent comedic value.When its not being actively and aggressively unfunny A Haunted House 2 is overexerting itself trying to find new ways to offend without offence. Its basically a tightly packed pomegranate of boring vulgarity repackaging the lamest racist caricaturing (all Mexicans are landscapers; all black men have big penises; all white women like black men because they have big penises) under the guise of ""post-racial"" tolerance. ""It wasnt racist until you clarified it"" Wayanss character protests when a white exorcist unpacks his use of the term ""you people.""Its just one example of the sort of clumsy juking and weaving A Haunted House 2 stumbles through in its blundering attempts to appear something other than straight-up racist something slightly better than awful. Even the tastelessness like the parody is toothless too scared to commit to its own dumb premises.A Haunted House 2 is dumber than dumb dumb which at least has the nerve to be unapologetically dumb. Worse its Wayans dumb.

A Haunted House 2 a witless horrific mess review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesA Haunted House 2 a witless horrific mess reviewA Haunted House 2 wastes the talents of everyone involved including star and co-writer Marlon Wayans in a horror spoof that is profoundly stupid. Marlon Wayans as Malcolm relaxes after a prolonged bout of love-making with a creepy doll in A Haunted House 2.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. April 17 2014A Haunted House 2Starring Marlon Wayans Jaime Pressly. Directed by Michael Tiddes. At GTA theatres. 87 minutes. 14AA Haunted House 2 is ostensibly a parody of Paranormal Activity and other recent horror films.It isnt. Thats because parody spoof whatever you want to call it implies wit and intelligence. This film has none of that.Article Continued BelowRather it is a vile wretched appalling waste of time a movie for morons that is offensive on so many levels. It is loud profane and profoundly stupid. One has to question how a film so awful could even be made it is that bad. Most regrettably it is not funny not even a tiny bit.Marlon Wayans is the ostensible brain behind the film no doubt encouraged by the success of last years A Haunted House which incredibly earned about 40 million. Wayans a member of the extended Wayans clan has demonstrated some talent as a comedic actor in older brother Keenans Scary Movie franchise. At least those were actual parodies.So this is not a man completely bereft of talent. He can handle physical comedy hes good looking and has some screen presence. But his talents as a comedy writer if this film offers any insight are completely imaginary.The membrane-thin plot goes something like this a year after his first encounter with the supernatural Malcolm (Wayans) has moved on and in to a new home with a new girlfriend and her two children. This time shes white allowing Wayans to riff on race. If only he had anything intelligent to say. Along the way there are a plethora of tasteless jokes a numbingly copious amount of profanity and use of the N word allusions to body parts and bodily functions (including a particularly cringeworthy demonstration of such) and pop culture references that should have those mentioned steaming and (fingers crossed) planning to sue for emotional distress.Wayans is front and centre throughout mugging flinching sweating screaming gesticulating gyrating weaving and bobbing. It is excruciatingly painful to watch.Everyone elses talents are similarly squandered including Jaime Presley as his wife Megan and Cedric the Entertainer returning from the first film as Father Williams demonstrating once again why he should stick to game-show hosting. Irredeemably dreadful in every way this is a film parents should actively discourage their children from seeing. Those who do find it entertaining should strongly consider seeking professional help. With a film this hauntingly bad the most terrifying prospect imaginable is the possibility of A Haunted House 3.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsDundas St. W.s Fugo Desserts serves up a smores coneIf you cant make it to a campfire this summer this treats for youNewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Imagine a Venn diagram charting three qualities silly gross and dumb. At the point where they overlap you will find the fright film spoof ""A Haunted House 2"" a scattershot anything-goes affair thats unapologetically stupid. Proudly stupid. Aggressively stupid. The film is writer-star Marlon Wayans take on suburban ghost stories. Putting himself a black man at the center of that usually lily-white genre gives him a target-rich environment for broad politically incorrect satire. The first entry in the series gave Wayans upwardly mobile new homeowner a head-spinning freak show of a girlfriend (weve all been there am I right guys?). Those demons banished he takes another shot at suburban life with his new girlfriend (Jaime Pressly) and her two teenagers. Once again the road to settling down and relationship-building is strewn with supernatural stumbling blocks. Wayans is repeatedly hypnotized by a chalk-faced creepy-eyed antique doll whose erotic magic sends him into a mating frenzy typically when Pressly or her kids are approaching the bedroom door. The stars gymnastic flesh-baring humping and randy pillow talk is funny at first. Its not the kind of joke that improves with repetition though. Wayans beats it to death then to smithereens then to dust motes. To the limited degree that the film works its thanks to the all-in commitment of the cast. In a Santeria blood sacrifice ritual Wayans has to catch pummel and slaughter a chicken that turns out to be remarkably uncooperative and tough. The scene is a master class in physically punishing over-the-top slapstick. Pressly is winning as Wayans oblivious cougarish new squeeze. Gabriel Iglesias provides good-humored ethnic awkwardness as Wayans Hispanic neighbor and Cedric the Entertainer returns as a serenely sinful exorcist. The film parodies a lot of movies that deserve it (its basic framework comes from the ""Paranormal Activity"" series the doll from ""The Conjuring"") and one or two that deserve better (the sublimely scary ""Sinister"" gets a thorough drubbing turning its occult killer into an accident-prone klutz). a haunted house 2 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for crude and sexual content nudity pervasive language drug use and some violent images. The script is lazy recycling countless genre cliches rather than inventing novel twists. The jokes arent just painted in broad strokes theyre applied with a roller. But at least in one way ""A Haunted House 2"" improves on the first entry in the series. That film had a long gratuitous shot of Nick Swardsons bare rump a horror that the sequel spares us. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.
