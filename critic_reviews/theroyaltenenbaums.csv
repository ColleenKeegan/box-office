With Gene Hackman Gwyneth Paltrow Ben Stiller Owen Wilson Luke Wilson Angelica Huston. Directed by Wes Anderson. Running time 103 mins. Rated R Language sexuality drug content. At the New York Film Festival. 3 1/2 Stars. While Hollywood has been carefully removing from its schedules movies that might seem inappropriate in light of current events its a shame Disney didnt decide to go the other way and move forward Wes Andersons offbeat gem ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" This comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family of eccentric geniuses is exactly the kind of movie America could use. Its funny poignant laced with irresistibly flawed characters and focuses on the power of love in a family even when nothing seems to be working. After ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" premieres in sold-out New York Film Festival screenings it opens Dec. 21. Seeming to take his inspiration from John Irving Booth Tarkington and J.D. Salinger Anderson has created a novel adaptation where no novel exists a movie where every character and scene implies depths that had to be shrewdly condensed for the shorthand demands of film. With a narrative introduction (by Alec Baldwin) we meet the family of the opportunist and narcissist Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) his anthropologist wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) and their three kids entrepreneurial genius Chas sports genius Richie and precocious playwright Margot - ""my adopted daughter Margot."" We meet them in the mid-60s and 22 years later long after the parents have separated as Royal is being kicked out of his hotel room for nonpayment. To move back into the family manse he says hes dying and has six weeks - tops - to live. Nobody pretends to care except Etheline and Richie (Luke Wilson) a disgraced tennis champion too worried about being in love with Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow). Chas (Ben Stiller) who made a fortune breeding dalmatian mice as a child is now a wealthy foul-tempered widower rearing two boys in his own image. Add to this loony arrangement Ethelines new romance with her long-time accountant (Danny Glover). Anderson (""Bottle Rocket"" ""Rushmore"") is a 31-year-old with a wonderfully wry and offbeat sense of humor a warm place in his heart for sibling relationships and a filmmaking style all his own. The performances are all terrific but Hackman is close to a career best as Royal the most useless man you cant help loving. The Oscar race has begun.

By Anthony Lane All happy families are functional; every dysfunctional family is dysfunctional in its own way although it may think of itself as perfectly functional and it may even end up happier in its own way than one of the happy ones. How lucky it is that Tolstoy did not live to see ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" a movie designed to revise all theories of domestic harmony. If Anna Karenina had been born a Tenenbaum she would never have jumped in front of the train. She would have lit a cigarette and put on the Rolling Stones. The setting is elusive. The time is the late seventies or early eighties but I wouldnt swear to it. The place is New York only it isnt. The director Wes Anderson shot most of the film in this city yet the New York that he came up with stands at one remove from the real thing--a step-city or a city-in-law somewhere more crumbling and crenellated than what we are used to and where the cabs are dying of rust. And here is a house as tall as a story was it really built you ask yourself or was it drawn by an eager child then painted and peopled accordingly? It has salmon-pink walls up the staircase a danceless ballroom and a tent of welcoming yellow pitched in the living room. This is the domain of the Tenenbaums the daylight answer to the Addamses the patriarch Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) his estranged wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) and their sons Chas (Ben Stiller) a widowed tycoon in a fuzzy red tracksuit and Richie (Luke Wilson)--hairy headbanded and dumb with discontent. He was a tennis star of international clout until one day he froze and folded on the court; the cause remains cloudy although it may involve his sister Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) with whom being a good Tenenbaum he happens to be in love. This isnt strictly incest because Margot was adopted. Nevertheless as her father points out ""its still frowned upon--but what isnt these days?"" I love that line; its at once breezy and nostalgic with a certain screw-you insouciance around the edges and Hackman tosses it off with his growling bonhomie relishing his status as the elder statesman who doubles as a Young Turk. Anderson plays a handy game of age-swapping in this film. Wisdom and skill are the property of the children whereas Royal races over the threshold of seniority with the grinning glee of a kid. (He disapproves of the risk-free no-fun atmosphere that is breathed by Chass young sons and when he spirits them out for a spree--swimming go-carting hitching a ride on the side of a garbage truck--it is hard to decide who enjoys it more.) By far the worst epoch we are led to understand is the prime of life the traditional hotbed of achievement. Take an advertising executive to this movie and he will choke on his Coke. All the Tenenbaum offspring were prodigies Margot was a playwright Richie was a racquet on legs and Chas as we are informed in the voice-over ""started buying real estate in his early teens."" But theres the joke. Hollywood loves a genius but these folk are exgeniuses has-beens and has-dones and their best days have faded by the time the movie begins. Gwyneth Paltrow gives Margot the faraway haze of a spent force; with her eyes so rich in mascara that she must have been taking tips from a panda and with the sad swish perfection of her Fendi mink she seems smaller and more defenseless than her earlier self whom we glimpse in a flurry of flashbacks. Paltrow like others in the cast bites hard into this role as if starved by most of the work shes been getting lately. The only performer who seems truly relaxed is Owen Wilson whose Bob Hope schnozzle and wide if secretive smile have become reliable tools to cheer an audience up. Not only does he play Eli Cash the boyhood pal of Richie and the adult swain of Margot; he also co-wrote the movie with Anderson and he gets to wear a cowboy hat. No wonder the guy looks pleased. Does ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" hang together and complete its mission? For all the funny glamour of its retro styling is it more than a freakorama? To begin with I wasnt sure; it was hard to establish what advance it marked on the majestic deadpan of ""Rushmore"" Andersons previous venture. (Bill Murray plays in both movies but his new role as Margots obliging husband is far more subdued.) Slowly however the communal oddity of the new picture began to hit home. For some reason I caught it first in the soundtrack notably in the sharp sprinkling of Ravel that Anderson throws over his chosen people--a pizzicato passage from the String Quartet which tightens our sense of the Tenenbaums as unpredictable toys either running down or whizzing out of control. Why else would Royal fake a fatal illness if not to move back into the palatial home? It is as though he were contriving to smuggle a little love--that most contraband of goods--into the household from which it has apparently been banished. Even when his impatient relations tip him out again he declares that the last six days have been among the finest of his life. A voice-over adds ""Immediately after making this statement Royal realized that it was true."" If you can explain the strange effect of that line youre doing better than I am. The whole tone of the film is like Paltrows eyes a steady gleam rimmed in darkness and only a blink away from mad. Look out for the fabulous shot near the end after Eli has crashed his sports car into the side of the house the camera travels along the scarlet flank of a fire truck leaping smoothly from one family member to the next and eavesdropping on their respective conversations--Royal befriending a dalmatian crossbreed for instance or the staid Henry Sherman (Danny Glover) Ethelines gentleman suitor explaining the legal and tax implications of the crash. Each character as ever is tucked into a shell of his or her obsessions and yet the filming itself--the grace of Andersons draftsmanship as it were--binds the figures together into a team. The movie has no climax no thundercrack of redemption and the death that rounds it off is no more grievous or unexpected than the rain that drops politely on the casket. The best way to approach ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" perhaps would be to visit your bookshelf and open your Edward Gorey; spend an evening with some of his writings and drawings rub against the velvet of his lugubrious wit and you will be ready for Royal and the clan. How do you cast Stockard Channing? Shes such a spunky presence that the camera doesnt always know where to look as though fearing the ferocity of her glance. Those rounded features still bear a vestige of the upbeat girlishness that won her the part of Betty Rizzo in ""Grease"" and yet so readily do they bunch and pucker with worry that Channing seems too grown up too wise to the layout of lifes trapdoors to be at ease in modern movies. If I could I would spirit her back to the days of Irene Dunne and Mary Astor--chipper neat-faced dames whose powers of reaction like Channings were comedy-quick even when there was nothing to laugh about. In ""The Business of Strangers"" Channing plays Julie Styron the vice-president of an investment company. That at any rate is her position at the start; by the end she has been not just professionally enhanced but emotionally wiped out. Dry deliberate and divorced from a husband who wanted children of all things Julie measures out her life in hotel rooms. The young writer-director Patrick Stettner knows how to dramatize an idea on a lo-cal budget; not for him the roar and bray of planes taking off but a simple abstraction of the grass beneath a jet combed in the downdraft like green corn. On the other hand I sensed the familiar arm twist that accompanies almost every film about business; if corporate existence were honestly as hellish and numbing as most artists--not just movie directors--would like it to be then nobody of any calibre would go into it in the first place. We are told in no uncertain terms how Julie feels about her work but we never really learn what she does. When a young tech assistant Paula Murphy (Julia Stiles) fails to arrive for a presentation Julie fires her. But planes get cancelled and the two women are stranded in an airport hotel with nothing in common but an empty evening and a full flow of Scotch. ""Thats a manly drink"" says Paula who far from being pissed at losing her job feels free to rib Julie for being stuffy middle-aged and cramped. Things turn nasty when Nick Harris (Frederick Weller) a feral headhunter (he prefers ""placement provider"") winds up in Julies room. Paula reveals that he once raped a friend of hers and egged on by Julie she exacts revenge. Looking back at the film I dont buy all this but no matter; Channing is so stormy so keen to unleash her resentments that for an hour or so you do believe in Julie--in all the wild words that she scrawls on the body of the half-naked Nick and the foxy right hook that she throws at Paula in return for a simple slap. If Patrick Stettner wants to be the Strindberg of the spreadsheet hes going about it the right way; think of the original Miss Julie taking fright in the clutches of her inferior. Just like the new one.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993. More Read something that means something Try The New Yorker for only a dollar a week. Subscribe Now.

Running time 110 minutes. Rated R (profanity nudity drugs). At the Lincoln Square and the Union Square; more theaters next week. ---- HOLLYWOOD has delivered its best Christmas gift 11 days early - ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" a ruefully hilarious star-bright faux-literary portrait of a highly dysfunctional family set in a storybook New York. Think the Addams Family meets J.D. Salingers Glass family with a little John Irving and Eloise thrown in for good measure. With a title and elegant opening narration (spoken by Alec Baldwin) that evokes ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" and mock chapter headings complete with character drawings its a classy if twisted treat. Fulfilling the promise he showed in ""Rushmore"" director Wes Anderson expertly sketches the sad story of the three Tenenbaum children prodigies whose accomplishments cease to become quite so prodigious when their father Royal (Gene Hackman) abruptly walks out on them and their mother Etheline (Anjelica Huston) when theyre barely in their teens. Twenty years later real estate tycoon Chas (Ben Stiller) is an anxiety-ridden basket case who holds midnight fire drills for his two young sons Ari and Uzi (Grant Rosenmeyer and Jonah Meyerson) - all three wear red sweatsuits all the time - in the wake of his wifes death in a plane crash. His sister Margot - who Royal never let anyone forget was adopted - was once a promising playwright. But now shes a kohl-rimmed depressive who locks herself in the bathroom when she isnt cuckolding her eccentric neurologist husband (Bill Murray) by sleeping with Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) a goofy author of bad western novels with a serious drug habit. Eli a sort of Tenenbaum wannabe with a best seller to prove it is the best friend of the third sibling the hirsute Richie (played by Owen Wilsons real-life brother Luke Wilson). Richie a one-time tennis star who secretly lusts after his adopted sister has banished himself to a never-ending round-the-world cruise since he blew the U.S. Open after Margos wedding. Chas decides to move himself and the kids into the upper Manhattan brownstone where he grew up - despite the fact that his mother an archaeologist is entertaining a marriage proposal from her longtime accountant Henry (Danny Glover). His jealous siblings soon follow along with the prodigal Royal - a disbarred lawyer whos been thrown out of his hotel for nonpayment. He isnt exactly given a royal welcome even when he starts claiming hes dying - a scam in which hes abetted by the family servant (Kumar Pallana) and an elevator operator (Seymour Cassel) who poses as Royals doctor. Hackman delivers an Oscar-worthy tour de force as the roguish Royal who will pilfer your heart as he reaches out to the extended clan for redemption - a montage where he teaches his overprotected grandchildren to ride on garbage trucks and shoplift is a classic. The rest of the cast is superb as well and Luke Wilson is particularly outstanding as the suicidal Richie. Anderson who collaborated on the script (as in his previous films) with his college buddy Owen Wilson gives everyone some of the best dialogue heard in a recent movie. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" which was shot at many unfamiliar locations around the city and boasts deliberately skewed geography is possibly the most quintessential New York film since ""Manhattan.""

Sign Up > Facebook Twitter Follow laweekly Other Manohla Dargis High Hopes Wednesday December 12 2001 at 12 a.m. By Manohla Dargis Wes Anderson is an authentic original -- an eccentric and heretical talent. Now 31 he has directed only a handful of films including an extended version of a short called Bottle Rocket and two other features the oddball romance Rushmore and now The Royal Tenenbaums about a family of former prodigies. As with the earlier films the new one is funny enough to be taken for a comedy but theres a deep vein of melancholia to its drollery an ineluctable air of sadness. Written as all Andersons films are with his close friend the actor Owen Wilson the film revisits the same passions that animate the earlier work -- friendship innocence love ennui -- this time through adult children who having never got over growing up live in a haze of disappointment. Their pathos is that while their genius has faded they can never succumb to ordinariness -- the grind from 9 to 5 the right girl or boy to love -- which is also their glory. Erstwhile genius has turned them into tragedians of their own existence however farcical or quotidian yet that early promise has been its own sort of benediction. Even at their most woebegone the Tenenbaums live in radiant hope that their lives can again be something other something different something better. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - This is no easy thing either for an individual to live or for an artist to convey particularly without pity or condescension. Its impossible if you dont love your characters as Anderson does -- generously and with aching tenderness. For all their mistakes missteps and spasms of outrageous narcissism his gentle misfits remain human never more than when at their worst The Royal Tenenbaums begins with Etheline Tenenbaum (Anjelica Huston) asking her husband Royal (Gene Hackman) to move out of the house. Royal breaks the bad news to the couples three young children -- two boys Chas and Richie and a girl named Margot -- while seated at the head of the familys vast dining table. Framed against a swirl of red velvet wallpaper his ubiquitous cigarette clamped in its holder Royal comes across less like a grieving husband and father than like a chief operating officer whos not only accepted the truth of a losing proposition but moved on already. ""It doesnt"" he admits with a shrug ""look good."" ""Was it our fault?"" asks one of the kids. ""No"" Royal answers before dispensing a nonchalant twist of the knife ""Obviously we made certain sacrifices as a result of having children.""Wearing a toupee that curls around the top of his head like a sleeping wombat Hackman makes a peculiar father though hes realer than most movie dads -- meaner too. The actor tends to play men who run cold or blistering hot and who often embrace both extremes at once which helps to explain why so many of them shiver with menace no matter what temperature theyre running. Hackmans Royal may not be a monster at least by the child-rearing standards of the late-1970s backdrop against which the story is launched but hes oblivious careless on the edge of cruelty. That Royal doesnt sentimentalize his three children and wouldnt begin to know how means that he also doesnt condescend to them. For better and often for worse he treats them like little adults as equals -- and sometimes calamitously as rivals. But all this fair play doesnt leave much room for kindness. Royal dismisses one of Margots fledgling theatrical efforts then tries to bandage the wound with a lie that neither of them believes ""Thats just one mans opinion."" Its Margots 11th birthday and shes just received the gift of her own imperfection; its a gift that will keep on giving.In Andersons first feature also titled Bottle Rocket (1996) theres a scene in which the character played by Owen Wilson Dignan decides to risk imprisonment in order to save a downed colleague. Dignan and his friends have just failed sensationally to rob a cold-storage company. They didnt need the money but they did need a reason to get up in the morning a reason to feel special. Mostly though they needed one another. Dignans friend (played by Owens brother Luke Wilson) tries to stop him from going back in the building but he refuses ""Theyll never catch me man cause Im fuckin innocent."" Hes caught of course but in doing so Dignan confirms his own freakish innocence as well as his poignancy. In that instant he finds a reason for being an escape hatch to a more perfect world maybe even transcendence; he becomes in another words yet another American hopeful buoyed by the specter of his own promise. The moment may be fantasy a reverie but as with the Tenenbaum childhood it glitters with possibility. In the new film Owen Wilson returns this time as Eli Cash a friend of the Tenenbaum children whos spent his entire life wanting to be one of them. Now a famous writer of anguished Cormac McCarthy--style prose Eli still yearns to be a Tenenbaum to find a place where he can safely hide from the outside world. Like Dignan he longs for a way out of the here and now. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Set in a gently fictionalized New York (the taxis are all heaps from the Gypsy Cab Co.) The Royal Tenenbaums unfolds primarily inside the familys sprawling brownstone a warren of startling color fanciful bibelots and objets trouves. As in The Magnificent Ambersons one of the storys touchstones (Salingers Glass family is another) the house tells a crucial part of the story first through the grandeur of its turrets (theres even a family flag) then 22 years later after the children have grown through its genteel dilapidation. By then Royal is long gone and the children have scattered. Chas (Ben Stiller) is lost in his work; Richie (Luke Wilson) is literally adrift a passenger on a transoceanic ship; back in the city Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) spends hours in a tub as her husband Raleigh (Bill Murray) taps on the locked bathroom door. Each of the children has spectacularly failed and failure has sealed them in solipsism Margot enjoyed early success as a playwright but soon fizzled while Richie went from tennis champion to burnout during one calamitous match. Entrepreneur Chas has endured a more brutal comeuppance He lost his wife in a plane crash. Always the straightest Tenenbaum he has become a neurotic protector of his sons to the point where he can no longer distinguish between genuine peril and the bumps of everyday life.Chas eventually figures out the difference but only after he returns to the Tenenbaum home and surrenders to adulthood. In Rushmore theres another prodigy who earns his comeuppance losing a woman he loves to his surrogate father (Murray again); but in losing he becomes the very child hed desperately tried to outgrow. In Andersons films adults and children rarely figure out how to play the roles that age has assigned them and who can blame them? In The Royal Tenenbaums the prodigies have become disappointed adults because theyre stuck in the dreams of childhood -- stuck there precisely because the dreams were so seductive. We first meet the kids through a series of fast funny montage sequences Theres Margot in fur and kohl eyeliner reading Chekhov and writing Chas wheeling and dealing in Brooks Brothers Richie racking up trophies. The sense of detail in these sequences is beautiful and fastidious recalling the obsessiveness you sometimes see in childrens play in the fantastic worlds they create from glass animals and figurines. But as the silky-voiced narrator (Alec Baldwin) guides us through these dioramas of precocious talent it becomes increasingly evident that the museum is also something of a mausoleum.It happens to all of us the fall from grace. Much depends on what happens next naturally but much depends on how you remember it -- as comedy tragedy or as Anderson has both. The world of The Royal Tenenbaums initially seems as unreal and at times almost as precious as that inside a glass paperweight. And its clear from the sheer verve -- the giddiness even -- with which he films the childrens early years that Anderson is as comfortable tucked inside his meticulousness as the Tenenbaums are tucked inside the family home -- hes more comfortable in a world of his own making than with the world beyond. But like Chas Richie and Margot hes starting to shake things up. By the time the children are grown Anderson has loosened his style almost as if he too were finally free of the constraints of so much early perfection. The framing seems less fastidious the camera movements more gestural while the vapor of self-congratulation that perfumed the Tenenbaums childhood has been blown away by the truth of adult lives in all their pain and new-found grace. In a film that verges on greatness it is a sign of terrific faith as well as of Andersons promise as a director that when one of the characters in The Royal Tenenbaums wears hospital pajamas after a detour into grief the words over his heart read ""recovery area.""

"ARTS-CULTURE - Family isnt a word it is a sentence{1} LOC[OK]{1} LOC[OK]LOC[Cancel]{1} LOC[OK]LOC[Cancel]LEADING NEWS SOURCE FOR TURKEY AND THE REGIONLogin | Become a member| I forgot my passwordxE-mailPasswordRemember meHOMETURKEYECONOMYWORLDSPORTSLIFEARTS/CULTUREOPINIONVIDEOPHOTOARTS-CULTURE Family isnt a word it is a sentence HDN | 12/15/2001 120000 AM | Wes Andersons ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" feels so much like a literary adaptation its surprising that the films source material is not a novel but the playfully off-kilter minds of Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson. Their original Wes Andersons ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" feels so much like a literary adaptation its surprising that the films source material is not a novel but the playfully off-kilter minds of Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson. Their original screenplay would make a nice template for a novel Rich characters with inner turmoil ripe for dissection on the page; interrelationships that lend themselves to equal parts comedy and drama; the marvelous premise that those blessed with genius can be more miserably absurdly ineffectual than the rest of us. While smart and highly entertaining ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" suffers some of the flaws of literary adaptations that dont quite hit the mark. With a rather artificial setup and overly contrived character motivations the film feels condensed as though it were the Cliffs Notes version of a bigger fuller story. At times the members of the Tenenbaum clan seem more like wacky types shaped to fit Anderson and Wilsons wacky situations; the opposite should be happening the circumstances arising organically from who these characters are. The movies saving grace is its terrific cast headed by Gene Hackman as patriarch-in-absentia Royal Tenenbaum. Once a prominent attorney now plunged into penury Royal maintains a rascally outlook as he contrives a scheme to reconnect with the family from which he parted ways years earlier by mutual consent of all involved. Anjelica Huston co-stars as Royals wife Etheline solicitous on preparing her three children for great deeds but less attentive on grounding them for the preoccupations of ordinary life and interaction. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Margot Tenenbaum a morose playwright who spends her time moping in the bathtub when shes not sleeping around. Ben Stiller is Chas Tenenbaum a frizzy-haired financial whiz paranoid over the safety of his two mop-headed sons after his wife dies in a plane crash. Luke Wilson (screenwriter Owens brother) is Richie Tenenbaum a champion tennis player who choked horribly in his final match and carries a huge torch for his adopted sister Margot. Owen Wilson co-stars as Eli Cash a childhood friend of the family whose abrupt success as a writer leads him into a Tenenbaum-like personal decline. Rounding out the main cast are Danny Glover as Ethelines colleague and suitor whose marriage proposal spurs Royal to re-enter the familys life; Bill Murray (a principal in Andersons previous film ""Rushmore"") as Margots dotingly dutiful husband; Seymour Cassel as a hotel elevator man Royal enlists as an operative in his ploy to reconquer the family; and Kumar Pallana as Royals servant-spy inside the Tenenbaum household. Each character brims with idiosyncrasies - Richie has spent a year aimlessly traveling on an ocean liner Chas and his sons wear identical red sweatsuits Margot wears a wooden prosthetic over the finger she mysteriously lost as a child (""Did you try to sew it back on?"" Margot is asked. ""Wasnt worth it"" is Margots listless reply.). While the situations sometimes feel forced Anderson has mounted an elegant production beautifully filmed and accentuated by pleasant narration from Alec Baldwin and classy storybook transitions. Hackman should merit serious best-actor consideration come Oscar time. Likewise for Huston and especially Paltrow on the supporting-actress front. The normally winsome Paltrow doesnt so much as crack a smile here creating a creepy Addams Family-like character who still manages to come across as pathetically lovable.

The bean counters are smiling -- the studios are enjoying a record-breaking year at the box office. But was anybody else happy? By consensus 2001 has been deemed the nadir of Hollywood creativity (although it was a strong year for the American independents and for foreign films ). Will the holiday season finally bring on all those great Oscar-worthy movies weve been waiting for? Truth to tell not one of the films we survey here gets our top prize of five stars. But dont despair. There are four here we smile upon and at least four more end-of-the-year worthies ""Iris"" ""Gosford Park"" ""Monsters Ball"" and ""Lantana"" -- in the wings. Roll emA Beautiful Mind (2 Stars)Dec. 21Jan. 4Director Ron Howards approach to the problem of the biopic is totally different from ""Alis"" Michael Mann. How do you make a mainstream movie out of the life of a man whose activity is almost entirely mental--the brilliant Nobel Prize-winning schizophrenic mathematician John Nash? Screenwriter Akiva Goldsmans clever solution is to turn the story of a troubled academic into a Hollywood thriller. How? He makes things up.I have to be vague here or Ill spoil the big twist of Howards movie which uses every trick in the book to keep you in your seat. It succeeds but at a cost. We meet Nash (Russell Crowe) at Princeton in 1947. ""I dont like people much and they dont like me"" he explains accurately in his deep West Virginia drawl. (The timbre of Crowes voice eerily resembles Jerry Falwells.) Hes prickly arrogant and antisocial but he happens to be a genius. His overactive mind captures the heart of his future wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) one of his students. But his life takes a dramatic turn when hes recruited by a CIA agent (Ed Harris) to do top-secret work breaking Russian codes. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Nashs increasingly dangerous cold-war adventures keep things lively but they prove to be a mere diversionary tactic. The real story is how Nashs mind is engulfed in madness and his and Alicias struggle to rebuild his shattered career. Howard knows how to make a difficult subject go down easy. Maybe too easy. Though Crowe proves again what a gifted chameleon he can be and Connelly is outstanding ""A Beautiful Mind"" is too facile to resonate deeply. Shouldnt a movie celebrating Nash give you some idea what his mathematical work is about? Fishier still is the suggestion that the cure for paranoid schizophrenia is love. Howards movie is being touted as an Oscar contender--Hollywood loves these ""triumph of the spirit"" sagas--but in ""solving"" the dilemma of the biopic its turned a fascinating life into formula.The Royal Tenenbaums (3 Stars)Dec. 28In the antic melancholy comedy ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" the singular Wes Anderson (""Rushmore"") abandons his native Texas for a storybook vision of New York. The unhappy Tenenbaum siblings owe an obvious debt to J. D. Salingers Glass family. Former child geniuses they have fallen on spiritual hard times. The widowed financial wizard Chas (Ben Stiller) is an angry fear-driven father obsessed with the safety of his two sons. Anhedonic failed playwright Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) who was adopted cheats on her husband (Bill Murray) with drug-addled Western novelist Eli Cash (Owen Wilson). Richie (Luke Wilson) is a former tennis champ miserably achingly in love with his sister. At the core of their problems is their long-absent rogue of a father Royal (an inspired Gene Hackman) who returns to the family brownstone feigning cancer in a duplicitous attempt to prevent his estranged wife (Anjelica Huston) from marrying the dapper family accountant (Danny Glover).Andersons style is as eccentric as his characters his unforgettable scenes unfold with the stillness and formality of tableaux. (The Tenenbaums are like colorful extinct creatures in a museum diorama.) Bursting with quirky details and unexpected detours the movie is almost too clever for its own good the whimsy can become self-admiring and the stop/start rhythm makes it feel longer than it is. ""Tenenbaums"" doesnt quite jell but its a beautiful near miss. And at the end in a poignant and funny scene of reconciliation this oddball family romance finally becomes as endearing as ones idea of it.The Shipping News (3 Stars)Dec. 25Jan. 11Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) the zhlubby browbeaten protagonist of Lasse Hallstroms affecting if somewhat ungainly version of Annie Proulxs novel isnt your typical movie hero. After the death of his brazen unfaithful wife (Cate Blanchett) this born loser sets off with his daughter and aunt (Judi Dench) to start a new life in frigid faraway Newfoundland the home of his ancestors. ""The Shipping News"" is the story of his rebirth his discovery of self-worth. Like the best of Hallstroms films ""My Life as a Dog"" and ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape"" it has a fresh uncondescending appreciation of the lives of people far outside the mainstream.This was not a novel screaming to be made into a movie. You can feel screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs struggling to stuff too many goodies into a short space. The seams show. But the dialogue has wit and home-cooked flavor. The characters--Denchs life-hardened Aunt Agnis Julianne Moores Wavey a widowed single mom and the cranky staff of the village newspaper where Quoyle gets work as a reporter--resist stereotype. Initially Spacey seems miscast overplaying his characters hapless naivete. But as Quoyle begins to discover his future by coming to grips with his familys dark past both Spacey and the movie hit their stride. ""The Shipping News"" has a quiet sense of community a wry unsentimental sweetness that grows on you. Its a patient movie for impatient times.Black Hawk Down (4 Stars)Dec. 28Jan. 18Imagine if the Normandy-invasion sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" went on for a hundred minutes instead of 20 and youll have some idea of the bloody harrowing intensity of Ridley Scotts movie. As brilliantly shot as it is brutally single-minded this is a war movie shorn of all its usual accouterments the battle is the plot. Following the blow-by-blow details in journalist Mark Bowdens book Scott and writers Ken Nolan and Steve Zaillian put you in the shoes of the Rangers and Delta Force soldiers who were sent into Mogadishu in 1993 to capture the lieutenants of the Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. What was meant to be a quick and easy strike turned into an 18-hour nightmare that left 18 American soldiers dead many more wounded and resulted in the hasty withdrawal of our troops from Somalia.You barely get to know the men Josh Hartnett Tom Sizemore Sam Shepard Eric Bana William Fichtner and the rest of the fine cast express their characters solely through their actions. The African enemy is virtually faceless. Scott isnt interested in politics or flag-waving the heroism he depicts has nothing to do with a cause and everything to do with a soldiers reflexive instinct to protect his brother in arms. Its hard not to admire Scotts uncompromising vision and the craft on display--editing cinematography production design sound--is awesome. But the relentless ferocity is punishing. You leave this long movie feeling battered drained--and thinking about the soldiers in Afghanistan whose lives are on the line right now.The Majestic (1 Star)Dec. 21Director Frank (""The Green Mile"") Darabonts ponderous attempt to make a Capra-esque fable set against the background of the McCarthy-era witch hunts is remarkably consistent theres not a spontaneous moment in it nor one that isnt inspired by another movie. Jim Carrey whos never looked so at a loss plays a blacklisted (though apolitical) screenwriter who wakes from a car crash with amnesia and wanders into a small town where hes mistaken for a war hero long thought to be dead. (Does anybody work in this town? The entire population seems to spend its time standing in the middle of Main Street alternately cheering and vilifying our hero.) Michael Sloanes secondhand screenplay--which reaches its accidentally timely climax when our Jimmy Stewart-like hero passionately defends the First Amendment--feels like a student work and Darabont makes things worse by treating the audience like infants. He. Directs. Very. Slowly. I staggered out of this shameless interminable movie feeling as if Id been force-fed a ton of mealy artificially sweetened baby food.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Perhaps the most effectively realized American comedy of the 90s 1998s Rushmore catapulted director Wes Anderson to the forefront of what was briefly known as the ""new sincerity"" movement along with partner Owen Wilson and fellow wunderkind Paul Thomas Anderson. Each draws heavily on the French New Wave and the work of directors like Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese while eschewing ironic distance and treating their outsider protagonists with affection and warmth. P.T. Anderson followed his magnificent 1997 breakthrough Boogie Nights with 1999s Magnolia a star-studded messy overreaching ultimately compelling ensemble drama in the vein of ambitious masterpieces like Hannah And Her Sisters and Short Cuts. Two years later Wes Anderson returns with his own star-studded messy overreaching ultimately compelling ensemble comedy-drama The Royal Tenenbaums a film that resembles Magnolia nearly as much as it does Rushmore. Just as Magnolia seemed designed for people who loved Boogie Nights but somehow felt that it wasnt long or ambitious enough Tenenbaums is the work of an artist who appreciates his own stylistic voice even more than his most ardent fans could. Painting on a huge delicately wrought canvas the film casts a wonderful Gene Hackman as the patriarch of a large dysfunctional clan of eccentric geniuses bearing a resemblance to J.D. Salingers Glass family right down to its Irish-Jewish heritage. Broke and tumbling rapidly down the social ladder Hackman attempts to reconcile with his estranged family in the process running roughshod over the delicate egos of his three grown children tormented former tennis star Luke Wilson resentful business maven and widowed father Ben Stiller and sullen secretive Gwyneth Paltrow. Hackmans separated wife Anjelica Huston meanwhile attempts to marry tweedy business partner Danny Glover over Hackmans unsubtle objections while Paltrow cheats on her Oliver Sacks-like husband (Bill Murray) with sweetly drug-addled Western writer Owen Wilson much to the chagrin of love-struck Luke Wilson. Like Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums is often hysterically funny but with a prominent undercurrent of death sadness and loss. Ultimately Anderson seems intent on making his latest film not just good or even great but a flat-out career-defining masterpiece. If he and Wilson love their actors characters and ideas too much to reign themselves in they at least overreach in the service of one of the years warmest funniest films.

Wes Anderson somewhat overreaches his considerable talents in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" an ambitious serio-comedy about an errant fathers attempt to reconcile with his eccentric family before its too late. As richly conceived as the novel it pretends to be and full of distinctive characters and scenes this piquant tale of a clan of underachieving New York geniuses underachieves in its own way by trapping an expansive probing story in a brittle highly artificial style that constricts character and emotional development. Like another grandly conceived third film by another fine young director named Anderson ""Magnolia"" ""Tenenbaums"" will provoke the full range of critical response from masterpiece to the emperors new clothes. Expect eager curiosity among upscale and serious auds in Christmas release following its world preem tonight at the New York Film Festival and possible general crossover based on its accessible dramatic and humorous content. Andersons first two features the Texas-lensed ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" also co-written with Owen Wilson were justly praised for their originality and distinctively sly comic voice but never broke out beyond cult status. Everything about the new pic announces more lofty aims -- the larger canvas the distinguished cast the family-saga format and literary ambitions that can most immediately be traced to J.D. Salinger. In the style of old studio adaptations that began with the turning of the first pages of a book so does ""Tenenbaums"" begin with the positioning of the narrative as a written account of a seriously fractured family. Narrator Alec Baldwin is busy right off the bat supplying reams of exposition about the clan which as its patriarch points out is ""one-quarter Hebrew and three-quarters mick Catholic"" but 100% American eccentric. Royal (Gene Hackman) is a formerly successful litigator who since abandoning the family years before was disbarred and imprisoned before becoming a hotel-dwelling layabout. Older son Chas (Ben Stiller) a financial genius from an early age is now a widower with two young sons; it was he who engineered his fathers ruin. Adopted daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a precocious playwright who hasnt written anything worthwhile since school days and leads a dubiously promiscuous life even while married to protective child therapist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). Younger son Richie (Luke Wilson) a former tennis prodigy wanders the high seas in apparent flight from professional disenchantment and the impossible love he has always felt for Margot who at one point ran off with his best friend successful novelist Eli Cash (Owen Wilson). Then theres the Tenenbaum mom Etheline (Anjelica Huston) who raised the kids after Royal left hasnt had sex in 18 years but now is considering the marriage proposal of her reserved colleague and bridge partner Henry Sherman (Danny Glover) even though shes not officially divorced. A sour lot to begin with the Tenenbaum kids move back into the family abode for their own reasons but become even more hostile when Dad shows up wanting to make amends. His initial claim that he has but six weeks to live -- designed to win back Etheline -- is immediately exposed as a lie driving his estranged wife to new heights of fury and the sincerity with which he asserts his longing to reconnect with his children to meet his grandchildren and to feel something resembling love from them is met with unyielding resistance. Exiled once again Royal takes up residence at the Y and takes a job at his hotel as a lowly elevator operator in order to pay his heavily accumulated dues. Most interesting story strand belongs to Margot and Richie. On the surface Margot is the one who seems the closest to being suicidal; unrelievedly listless and still insecure due to her adopted status she is the one who appears to have been most injured emotionally by Royals abandonment. But in fact its the more emotionally opaque Richie who is teetering nearest to the abyss. As fixated on Margot as he is Richie still considers the mere idea of their love illicit despite the fact that they are not technically brother and sister; even when he shares his pain with Royal and surprisingly receives the green light to pursue his desires he cant get over the barrier that both is and isnt there. By the final stretch the ache these characters feel -- about their unfulfilled potential and their unrealized relationships with those closest to them -- should be palpable not to mention deeply moving. Its a story of a desperate attempt to repair missed connections one inevitably doomed to failure but not without dividends. But the arch precise calculating style that so well served the prankish aims of ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" proves unwelcomely restrictive to the more demanding needs of this picture; Andersons crisp narrative approach and tidy visuals havent matured to accommodate a more fulsome storyline and diverse set of characters. If one looks closely at the text of the would-be ""Tenenbaums"" novel that periodically flashes on screen the sentences all appear to be simple declarative ones without subtext shadings or emotional evocation. So it is with Andersons cinematic style in the service of a tremendously ripe subject. One can scarcely fault this wonderful group of gifted actors. Bringing a goofy over-the-hill swingers edge to Royals earnestness of intent Hackman is wonderful as far as the scripts lack of psychological dimension allows him to go; his boisterous presence and refusal to be defeated give the pic extra energy. Huston bestows Etheline with nicely paradoxical opposing elements of caution and a willingness to still be surprised by life and cast against type Glover must certainly be playing the most timorous recessive man hes ever portrayed onscreen. Stiller is called upon to express little beyond intolerant stoniness and co-writer Wilsons self-consciously humorous swagger is seen to more comic effect currently in ""Zoolander."" But his brother Luke takes advantage of his best screen opportunity to effectively explore a truly haunted figure and Paltrow discovers a new register for her talents in a strong turn as a woman who has everything -- looks talent and money anyway -- except a properly functioning heart. Anderson stalwart Kumar Pallana amusingly appears as the longtime family majordomo who follows Royal into exile while Murray is underutilized compared to his brilliant turn in ""Rushmore."" A valentine to a very particular notion of New York pic is technically immaculate and sports especially resourceful production design by David Wasco and costumes by Karen Patch. Film is festooned with significant pop tunes particularly by the Beatles and Rolling Stones which Anderson stressed at the New York Fest press conference had not yet been cleared as of the premiere.

Not that the extended dysfunctional New York family of the title are happy campers by any means; like Salingers Glass family theyre a disarming mix of prodigal talents crippling incapacities and diverging ethnicities. The movies affection for them all is certainly infectious and the cast is wonderful Danny Glover Gene Hackman Anjelica Huston Bill Murray Gwyneth Paltrow Ben Stiller Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson.

"Vanilla Sky and The Royal Tenenbaums reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Vanilla Sky and The Royal Tenenbaums reviewed. Vanilla Sky and The Royal Tenenbaums reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 14 2001 1038 AM Close Your Eyes Vanilla Sky leaves a bad taste; Wes Anderson traps his actors in The Royal Tenenbaums. By David Edelstein The prospect of sitting through another hapless Hollywood remake of a foreign art film is only mildly more enticing than a colon exam; that said I was hoping for a better night out from Vanilla Sky (Paramount) Cameron Crowes MTV-style mortification of the 1997 Spanish psychodrama Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). No matter what else they lack Crowes movies-- Say Anything ... Singles Jerry Maguire Almost Famous--have a core of feeling You can discern the writer-directors struggle to spin his fear of loneliness into doleful comic gold. And he was reportedly excited about translating Alejandro Amenabars surreal meditation on identity into Hollywood-ese perhaps as a happy respite from having to streamline his own experiences in such projects as last years Almost Famous. But Crowe is like a Method actor whose talent is proportional to how much of himself he can draw upon. It speaks well for him that he cant identify too closely with the dream life of Tom Cruise. Advertisement The template that hes working from (and to which he has stayed faithful) is a hysterical but resonant fantasy Rooted in solipsism Abre los Ojos successfully evolves into a sci-fi exploration of solipsisms perils. A rich jaw-droppingly handsome young man (Eduardo Noriega) who treats women and close male friends with casual disregard feels the first stirrings of real love in the presence of a beautiful but authentically quirky woman (Penelope Cruz). His spurned female lover then rises like a wraith to destroy his face--which means his life is destroyed too since his world has only existed to accommodate (and reflect) his shallow beauty. In the second half his visage might or might not be repaired and he might or might not end up with the nice girl--disorientation comes thick and fast. The film builds to an awakening thats both physical and emotional ""Eyes Wide Shut"" would have made a good title better for this parable than for Stanley Kubricks somnolent dream-movie. The title of the American version is a reference to the seductive palette of Monet whose world the protagonist David Aames (Cruise) longs to inhabit. He makes a speech to that effect to Penelope Cruz who repeats her role in English or whats meant to be English--the vowels are rearranged and the consonants somewhat approximate. The Monet monologue is only one of Cruises unconvincing scenes; he radiates inauthenticity even in a rubber mask. Admiring his silken locks in one of innumerable mirrors Cruise portrays self-intoxication the way Sylvester Stallone portrays obnoxiousness The self-send-up is so superficial and so suffused with the real thing that he ends up looking like the only one whos not in on the joke. Aames is not just a rich boy but a hip-magazine publishing magnate a change that seems calculated to give the star the opportunity to act out his Jann Wenner/Graydon Carter fantasies but that only adds distractions (and red herrings). His lifestyle is probably also meant to justify Crowes rock-video syntax which is designed to show how Aames is even further distanced from his real self by all the TV monitors giant video billboards and holograms that fill his space. Theres nothing inherently wrong with this strategy; it seems an honest attempt by Crowe to use his beloved rock n roll (many of the songs were written by old friends as well as by his wife Nancy Wilson) to underscore the heros dislocation. The problem is that Crowe and Amenabar come from opposite vantage points on popular culture. The Spaniard (he made his English-language debut with TheOthers) dips into his literatures rich tradition of subjectivity-as-reality (la vida es sueno and all that) to portray fantasy as a solipsistic dead end. Crowe on the other hand has built his aesthetic on the belief that passionate fantasy (especially rock-n-roll fantasy) is the best way to transcend the self and make contact with other people. Its no wonder that Crowe cant generate any real feeling. The narrative is alien to him on every level. Advertisement The ear-grating dialogue is a good indication that he didnt know what he was doing; hes usually pitch-perfect. I was too busy wincing to get down the worst line--something about how after you go off a bridge at 80 miles an hour you dont accept happiness without a full body search. (Its hard to read my paraphrase without wincing.) Even the casting is screwy. Kurt Russell reportedly agreed to play Cruises psychiatrist before hed read the script; he kept his word after he had read it which makes him both an honorable man and an incredible sucker. As the demonically obsessive woman whom Cruise throws over to make happy-talk with his cartoon Spanish mouse Cameron Diaz throws the whole ominous dreamscape out of whack I can think of many words to describe the notion of going to bed with Penelope Cruz and waking up with Cameron Diaz but ""nightmare"" isnt one of them. In Wes Andersons The Royal Tenenbaums (Touchstone) the estranged self-centered father (Gene Hackman) of a family of tortured geniuses discovers hes broke and tries to wheedle his way back into the hearts of his wife and grown children. Its the sort of role that has ""Jack Lemmon"" written all over it--i.e. slippery shading into moist. But Hackman gives the con-man lines a simple straight-ahead urgency that makes the man first hilarious and then as the pleasures of human company are withdrawn and his resentment begins to bubble up inexplicably touching. This is a great performance It transcends Andersons jokey near-symmetrical frames (the film is designed as a kind of ""only in New York"" childrens storybook with the characters living in life-size dollhouses) and achieves its own truth. The rest of the movie has moments Its an elegant witty frame that hasnt been filled in. Anderson wants to show the Tenenbaum kids (played by Ben Stiller Gwyneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson with co-writer Owen Wilson as a neighbor and ""honorary"" Tenenbaum) as having been driven by their unhappy upbringing to turn themselves into caricatures--and then to show how miserably trapped they are in their own personae. But apart from Hackman the actors look more trapped by Andersons rigid framing color scheme and enforced deadpan. Paltrow manages to be funny as the playwright whos a prisoner of her own woe (her eyes are rimmed with black but she wears little-girl Lacoste dresses) and Owen Wilson does a riotous stoned-paranoid shtick on a send-up of Charlie Rose (Larry Pine slouches artfully in the role) but Anderson doesnt throw the others (especially the seething one-note Stiller) any lifelines. At least hes responsive to criticism. At this years New York Film Festival in September the pop songs vied with the actors for attention (the actors came in second) and Mark Mothersbaughs nudge-nudge score left me feeling as if my ribs had all been broken. In the face of critics complaints most of that music is gone now and the volume has been lowered on the vocals too. That means that some of the lamer jokes play to eerie silence but the performers--and their emotions--have less competition from the show-off Wunderkind director. Its an excellent trade-off and one that bodes well for the next installment in young Wes oeuvre. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

The `Royal Whee Infuses Tale - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-New Yorker The `Royal Whee Infuses TaleMovies - REVIEW - The Royal TenenbaumsIts The Little Things That Help The Tenenbaums Say A Lot About FamilyJanuary 4 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticThe Royal Tenenbaums is a movie thats inspired by a magazine.Not a magazine article you understand. A magazine.In particular the film (which opens today) is inspired by The New Yorker of the period before it decided to be more like other magazines. That was back when it still cherished whimsy ran long profiles about eccentric personalities and cultivated a clubby air of concerned but comfortable detachment.Wes Anderson (Rushmore) who co-wrote and directed this one-of-a-kind comedy about a family of failed geniuses has cited as inspirations such authors as A.J. Liebling J.D. Salinger and James Thurber all of whom are closely associated with the publication.Even if youre not a longtime New Yorker reader you will immediately recognize that The Royal Tenenbaums is different from other movies. Adjectives such as whimsical detached and eccentric -- adjectives not often found in contemporary movie reviews -- are appropriate to this film. And so is one more soulful.Ultimately the movie is deeper than it appears to be -- sort of like the old New Yorker come to think of it.Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson take as their subject the Tenenbaum clan flaky residents of an idealized New York.These include Royal (Gene Hackman) and Etheline (Anjelica Huston) long estranged and now up in years as well as their sons Richie (Luke Wilson Owens real-life brother) a former tennis prodigy and Chas (Ben Stiller) who began an amazing career in real-estate speculation in his early teens.There is also Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) an adopted child who as a ninth-grader was already a celebrated playwright. Eli Cash (screenwriter Owen Wilson) an author of western novels isnt really a Tenenbaum but rather a neighbor who grew up with the family and has become an unofficial member.For three years Royal hasnt spoken to anyone in his family; in fact he abandoned them many years earlier for reasons unspecified.But now dear old dad has run out of money and wants to reconnect. And so to that end he pretends that he is terminally ill and asks to live in their mini-mansion.How can they refuse?The Tenenbaums arent as obviously weird as the people in The Addams Family the 1991 comedy inspired by the drawings of New Yorker cartoonist Charles Addams. But there is something of the Addams strangeness about them.They also bring to mind the off-the-wall family in You Cant Take It With You the Frank Capra movie comedy based on the Kaufman and Hart play. That film no one ever seems to remember won the Academy Award for best picture of 1938. (Filmmaker Anderson has mentioned it too as an inspiration for his film.)There is little chance of The Royal Tenenbaums winning a best-picture Oscar. Whimsy detachment and eccentricity are even more out-of-fashion in Hollywood than they are at todays New Yorker.But that only makes Andersons unpretentious achievement all the more heroic.Where does the humor come from in The Royal Tenenbaums?From little things mostly.Some of it comes from the way the characters dress. They all pretty much wear uniforms suggesting a profound lack of personal growth that is both disturbing and hilarious.Eli in keeping with his chosen literary milieu sports a 10-gallon hat and buckskin togs. Margot meanwhile is usually seen in raccoonlike eye makeup Lacoste dresses preppy loafers a mink coat and pink gloves. (The gloves hide a wooden finger but thats another story.) As for Chas and his two young sons they have curly black hair and wear matching red jumpsuits for safety -- so that they can easily spot one another.The humor also comes from the many ways the actors bring their characters to comic life.Chas is inconsolably angry at his father for the years of neglect while the adopted Margot seems somehow to have accepted (or at least learned to tolerate) the horrible fact that Royal has never considered her to be a true Tenenbaum. Luke yearns for a romance that seems hopeless Etheline remains a little in love with Royal despite everything and Eli is well weird in a way that even his sagebrush affectations and stoner habits dont fully explain. (If all of these people are extraterrestrials Eli is from the dark side of the moon.)As for Royal this shifty yet endearing old liar is the motor that drives the movie. Its hard to imagine anyone but Hackman taking such a disgustingly selfish character and making him seem lovable precisely for his selfishness and for the obvious delight he takes in behaving that way.There are other amusing people here too notably Margots long-suffering spouse (Bill Murray) the familys wary accountant and Ethelines new beau (Danny Glover) and Royals inexplicably faithful confederates (Seymour Cassel and Kumar Pallana). Narrating the movie as if he were reading aloud a novel or a long magazine article is Alec Baldwin.There is much humor too in the always-surprising ways these people interact Margot to take just one example is clearly far more embarrassed at being found out as a smoker than as an adulterer.Despite the stylization of this movie and the exaggerated behavior of its characters The Royal Tenenbaums has a lot to say about family as well as about early promise and how to live with not living up to it.There is something a little sad about this movie just as there was always an implicit melancholy about the old New Yorker. It seemed to have been created by people whose aspirations were once impossibly higher than their eventual achievements and read by people who often had their glory days behind them.Both of these things apply to the Tenenbaums who in the end at least have each other.

The Royal Tenenbaums cements this reputation for quirky comedies powered by sly intelligence. But it also ventures onto new ground. Its darker than Rushmores jaunty schoolboy odyssey tossing bizarre deaths drug abuse and an on-screen suicide attempt into the mix. Its also less focused owing to a large cast with complex relationships. But Anderson again gets the job done. He makes us laugh he makes us think and he does it in a distinctive screwball style both as director and as co-writer with Owen Wilson. Wilson also stars playing Eli an envious neighbor of the gifted intellectual colorful and once-affluent Tenenbaums. Ground Zero for these dysfunctional geniuses is a declining manse on New Yorks Upper East Side topped by a weakly waving flag of the family crest. As the ads say family isnt a word Its a sentence. Serving time in isolation is patriarch Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) a self-absorbed shady lawyer with simple yet voracious tastes. Hes lived apart from the family since wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) threw him out for womanizing two decades ago. As shown via a dizzying delightful backstory at the start -- in the strongest echoes of Rushmore -- she devotedly raised their kids alone. And much like Rushmores Jason Schwartzman they proved to be amazingly precocious. Chas (Ben Stiller) conquered business in his teens marketing spotted white ""dalmatian"" mice and dealing in real estate. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) won a grant for playwrighting in the ninth grade and wrote a string of strong works. Ritchie (Owens brother Luke Wilson) became a champion tennis player. But having vented their drive and creativity as kids each has faltered as an adult retreating into shells of insecurity resentment and loneliness. All feel abandoned by a dad who was inattentive even when he was around and who forever reminded Margot she was adopted. Margot has married a staid scholarly man she doesnt love (Bill Murray) and glumly spends hours smoking soaking in a tub and disengagedly watching television. Ritchie has drifted -- literally -- for two years taking aimless cruises to forget his secret incestuous love for Margot. (At least theyre not blood kin.) Since his wifes violent death Chas has become overprotective of his kids to the point of smothering them and he vents the paternal anger his siblings have internalized. Circumstances fling them together again when Royal returns home to announce hes dying. Hes not. Hes just broke and needs a roof. But he also wants to reassert family bonds especially with Etheline about to marry a kind and responsible man (Danny Glover). Their ensuing misadventures are rife with social commentary nods to J.D. Salinger whimsical Gotham romanticism and spiritual undertones. Yet Tenenbaums can be embraced just for the twisted smile on its face -- for that peculiar brand of humor Anderson has burned into cinema. Again he shows careful attention to detail. Sets are crammed with mischievous flourishes (Andersons brother Eric created the crude drawings that Etheline lovingly framed) and dusty anachronisms signal the clans decline. Anderson also peppers Mark Mothersbaughs spare but potent score with his usual astute array of vintage rock from Rolling Stones album tracks to the obscure but influential Velvet Underground. But his large casts performances are a mixed bag. After getting the role of a lifetime in Rushmore Murray is wasted here as an odd man out who never gets to be oddly entertaining. Neither of the laid-back Wilson brothers seem driven by the inner demons their characters require unlike Stiller who chews into a rare semi-dramatic role. Paltrow paints a pitiable portrait yet her sad sulking is lifeless. But the child actors are superb. Anderson has a knack for casting credible nonactorly kids with goofy charm and endearing ordinariness. Also Huston is a sympathetic source of strength bravely maintaining a severely tested resilience. Yet the film belongs to Hackman whos both its charismatic heel and its heart. His Royal is flush with blunt boorish behavior but hes also honest about his failures and truly wants to make amends. Royal even plays impish Auntie Mame to Chas stifled kids teaching them to hurl water balloons and merrily drive go-carts (which after Rushmore have become an Anderson signature). In short youre rooting more for his redemption than for the forced romantic unions that greet his return. Without this drive for atonement The Royal Tenenbaums might drift in a sea of quirks searching for pat boy-girl resolutions to complex family crises. Instead it rides waves of offbeat insightful humor toward one mans grasp for grace. He may have clumsily branched apart from the family tree but as they say blood is thicker than water balloons.

Salingers invention might well live down the street from the fairy-tale clan that represents the soul of a fragile but bountiful New York City in Wes Andersons shimmering new picture The Royal Tenenbaums. Reminiscent of Salingers Manhattanites the Tenenbaums are privileged natives in a landscape that doesnt exist and perhaps never existed but seduces with the possibility of having existed once in a cozier more Christmasy past. Like the Glass progeny - and indeed like the young people in Andersons previous childs-eye productions ""Rushmore"" and ""Bottle Rocket"" - the Tenenbaum children are precocious and extraordinary yet not protected from unhappiness by their own gifts. Chas (Ben Stiller his truculence harnessed to unusually good effect) a child tycoon grows into an angry fearful widowed father of two overprotected sons. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow tapping into funny inner sullenness) the Tenenbaums adopted daughter was once a baby-genius playwright but is now the mournfully kohl-rimmed fur- wrapped chain-smoking depressed wife of a moth-eaten neurologist (Bill Murray fluent in Andersons language). The baby Richie (Luke Wilson) a former tennis prodigy ruined his career out of his obsessive love for Margot and now travels the world in woeful loneliness his dorky Bjorn Borg-issue headband the only relic of his former athletic fame. Even the envious kid across the street a hanger-on with none of the T familys financial or cultural assets shares in his neighbors mixed fortunes Eli (Owen Wilson who also cowrote the fabulous screenplay with Anderson) is now a famous writer of the fake-cowboy school - but hes also got a drug problem. Unlike the Glass kids though who seemed to have grown themselves from coffee beans the presence of the Tenenbaum parents Etheline (Anjelica Huston) and Royal (Gene Hackman) can be felt everywhere. Actually the state of the adult childrens disrepair is a direct legacy of their parents long separation during which Etheline eventually snuggled up to the familys bow-tied gentlemanly accountant (Danny Glover) and Royal blew just about all the goodwill anyone might have had for him with his loutish irresponsible behavior. ""Two decades of failure and betrayal"" is the cause of dysfunction as diagnosed with dry empathy by the unseen narrator (Alec Baldwin). Theres cause for optimism that the legacy can be changed The movie chronicles Royals attempts to make amends with his family before its too late - and in so doing help mend the injuries of everyone else in the household right down to the family nonbutler (Kumar Pallana). ""I want this family to love me"" the old man demands. And the soul of the movies eccentric generosity of spirit beats in Hackmans great wise subversively unsentimental performance as Royal a grandfather who teaches his overdisciplined grandsons how to bet at dogfights and cross streets against the light. The pictures creative pulse though is clearly brightly powerfully that of Anderson a filmmaker whose storytelling style is so fresh so happily idiosyncratic and so all-encompassing that it stirs up strong response from people who either love or dont love his stuff. But Anderson never demands love or attention never demeans never makes fun of his dollhouse family even when being funny about their extremis. Heres a movie guy (the Texas-bred Anderson is too homegrown I think to be encumbered with a barfight-starting French designation like auteur) whose cinematic vision gives off a personal identifiable glow. ""Tenenbaums"" is intricate fine-stitched embroidered with sumptuous details - sometimes nuttily sumptuous - from the texture-obsessed production design of David Wasco to the garment-for-garment perfect costumes of Karen Patch. Few ensembles express sadder sad sack defiance than the matching ""shlub and sons"" firetruck red track suits worn by Chas and his two boys Ari and Uzi. Few musical choices meanwhile are as inspired a way to circulate air under the movies glass-domed biosphere as the snippets taken from Ravels ravishing F Major String Quartet and Vince Guaraldis glistening Peanuts hymn ""Christmas Time Is Here."" The filmmaker who knows how to speak Ravel as well as Gwyneth is indeed a royal gift to the future of American movies.

Directed by Wes Anderson from a screenplay by Anderson and Owen Wilson. 108 minutes. Rated R for some language sexuality/nudity and drug content. Neptune. E-mail this article Print this article Wes Andersons ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" like his sublime 1998 film ""Rushmore"" is a rich mixture of sadness comfort and joy. Its sad because many of its characters have suffered losses and are grieving (for a loved one for childhood for security); comforting in Andersons trademark optimism and fondness for forgotten objects (a library card a game on a shelf); and joyful in its ultimate affirmation of the heroism of ordinary life. Oh and its really funny too. The young directors films (hes 32) may be an acquired taste -- those who didnt like ""Rushmore"" are likely to have similar objections to ""Tenenbaums."" Andersons hyper-stylized world is immediately recognizable; he likes to showcase his actors in single perfectly centered shots as if posing them for a Christmas card. Costumes verge on the surreal (Gwyneth Paltrow wears the same mink coat and striped shirtdress for the entire movie) and everyone behaves oddly The adults are childish the children strangely quiet and adult-like. All this adds up to outsized unpredictable filmmaking -- life as if drawn by an Etch-a-Sketch. Its perhaps inevitable that ""Tenenbaums"" feels a little less fresh than ""Rushmore"" as it shares so many similarities (down to several cast members and the wistful use of Vince Guaraldis ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" music). But the new film creates an oddball happiness of its own. Among the stellar cast are Gene Hackman as a flawed paterfamilias Anjelica Huston as the distracted divorced mother of a troubled genius brood Ben Stiller as her eldest son Chas (once a financial whiz kid now a grieving widower) Paltrow as her troubled playwright daughter Luke Wilson as the youngest son a former tennis star who still wears sweatbands. Outside the family Owen Wilson is marvelous as a writer of pulp Westerns (""the James Joyce of the West"") who becomes mesmerized upon hearing his own words read aloud. And Danny Glover brings a quiet goodness to the role of Henry Sherman Hustons fiance. He and Stiller share a remarkable moment Chas whos been angry for much of the film tentatively tells Henry that hes a widower. Henry who also lost his first wife says gently ""I know you are Chas."" Its such a perfectly kind hopeful moment that it almost inspires tears. Turns out Andersons telling us the same thing that the Beatles did years ago All we need is love.

Starring Gene Hackman Anjelica Huston Gwyneth Paltrow Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller. Directed by Wes Anderson. (VHS and DVD. R. 115 minutes.) ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" might have been about the rise and fall of a family of gifted children. That would have been the typical way to approach the story. Instead its something rare -- a movie about people who have already fallen whose best days are behind them. This is the third film by Wes Anderson who started his career with the irritating and incoherent ""Bottle Rocket"" then took a giant step with ""Rushmore"" about a gifted 15-year-old. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" represents another giant step. At times its clumsy but then smoothness is an overrated virtue easiest to achieve when one has nothing new to say. In ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" Anderson explores a new tone gives vent to a distinct sensibility and style of humor and finds completely offbeat ways of tugging at the emotions. In the process he has made a film like no other an epic depressive comedy with lots of ironic laughs and a humane and rather sad feeling at its core. A brief prologue -- narrated by Alec Baldwin -- introduces the Tenenbaum siblings as children. Oldest son Chas was a gifted international trader while in junior high school. Adopted sister Margot was a successful playwright in her early teens. Richie was a tennis pro from the minute he picked up a racket. But then the father Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) left the mother Etheline (Anjelica Huston) and the familys magic began to wane. The movie has a light-fingered quirkiness thats original and engaging. Chas trapped in a state of furious shell shock and fear after his wife dies in a plane crash torments his sons with middle-of-the-night evacuation drills. Like most of the comic bits the spectacle is infused with recognition of lifes unavoidable tragedies. In Royal Tenenbaum Gene Hackman finds one of his classic roles one calling for that combination of geniality and menace thats the actors hallmark. As Royal hes a charismatic delight with a dapper lack of sensitivity and an unerring instinct for inflicting offhand damage on his children. That Hackman succeeds in making this the essence of Royals charm is really rather brilliant. . This film contains strong language and nudity.

So watch for the shot of an unfolding book at the start of The Royal Tenenbaums.The book bears the same title as the movie and suggests a literary antecedent that doesnt in fact exist. Instead the screenplay by director Wes Anderson and his writing partner Owen Wilson is an original -- highly original because as these two proved in Rushmore they deal in a brand of humour thats easier to appreciate than describe. Its dark but not exactly black and the serious stuff between the laughs is equally unique -- sad but not precisely tragic genuinely odd and yet strangely familiar. But back to that first shot. The pretense of the book serves a specific purpose reminding us that the family were about to see has deep novelistic roots. Through an introductory flashback it soon grows clear that the Tenenbaums bear more than a passing resemblance to the doomed Glass clan of J. D. Salinger. They too are a ""family of geniuses"" whose three offspring displayed prodigious talent at a callow age Chas the little financial wizard; Richie the tennis phenom; and adopted Margot the gifted playwright. But the Tenenbaum kids like the Glasses did not age well. Cut to the present where its obvious the years havent treated them kindly -- after ""more than two decades of failure"" each one is fruit-cake nutty and loon-crazy.Why? By consensus the blame seems to fall on the patriarch. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) walked out on his archeologist wife (Anjelica Huston) when the children were at the peak of their precocious powers. Since then its been a slippery slope for everyone including Royal himself who is now a disbarred lawyer and an icon of shabby gentility his glory as faded as the hotel he lives in.As for his adult offspring heres the pathetic box-scorePale of face and eyes rimmed in kohl Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) has suffered a catatonic case of writers block is reduced to smoking furtively behind locked doors and cheating openly on her ersatz-daddy husband (Bill Murray).Having lost his Midas touch Chas (Ben Stiller) is hardly better off; widowed when his wife died in a plane crash he obsesses over the safety of his own children and nurtures an abiding hatred for his long-absent father.Finally theres Richie (Luke Wilson) who after a meltdown on centre court during a championship match has abandoned his tennis aspirations but not his tennis attire -- hiding out on some round-the-world freighter he still sports his Bjorn Borg headband and matching wristlets.Episodic yet weirdly funny these establishing scenes lead to the narratives central conceit The dysfunctional clan find themselves reconvening under the same roof in the old family home -- a decrepit mansion that like the wounded souls within it and the big city around it seems to exist in a time out of time. The place is Manhattan but not one youll recognize just some anachronistic burgh of rusty cabs and crumbling brownstones. The setting the costumes -- it all seems neither here nor there neither past nor present. Anderson has given the film the appearance of a bizarrely fractured fairy tale.Of course the tales toppled king is old Royal. His bad tidings are the reason for the Tenenbaum reunion. Ostensibly suffering from terminal cancer Royal has six weeks left ""to make up for lost time"" to become the caring father he never was.Problem is Royal doesnt look sick and hasnt a remorseful bone in his robust body. Hackman serves him up as a careless force of nature and has a ball doing it. You get the feeling that the entire ensemble including Danny Glover cast against type as a staid yet shrewd accountant is grateful for the chance to chew on the meaty eccentricity of their parts. But Hackman swallows his role whole.Check out the sequence where Royal trying to breed ""some recklessness"" into his sheltered grandsons has them crossing the street against the light and joyriding on the back of a garbage truck. Now look at Hackmans face -- its lit up more brightly than the kids a beacon of devil-may-care joy.Later when Richie confesses his incestuous longings toward his adopted sister the same face flickers with interest but not disapproval and Royals response is classic ""Its still frowned upon but what isnt these days."" Hackman has displayed a broad range in his distinguished career; however just as Rushmore did for Bill Murray this film opens up a whole new side of him -- hes never before seemed quite so giddily liberated on camera.In a sense the whole movie is like Hackmans performance -- wonderfully free-wheeling and delightfully mad yet brought off with a fluid confidence that somehow makes the disjointed parts magically cohere. Or maybe another comparison is more apt. At one sad-funny point a distraught figure tries to kill himself but chooses to leave off writing the suicide note until after he regains consciousness. Well The Royal Tenenbaums plays like that de facto note -- completely unhinged yet graced with a peculiarly optimistic charm.Admittedly theres scant redemption here and little in the way of a deeper theme. Nevertheless although the splintered characters essentially remain cocooned in their unhealthy obsessions they do come into beguiling focus for the audience (if not for themselves). In other words we care about these lost people. And thats Andersons great achievement and perhaps his only message.Many of us will love this movie this troubled clan in the same way that many of us love our own families -- despite ourselves counterintuitively yet warmly and for reasons that have little to do with reason itself.

We are all say Anderson and Owen Wilson his cowriter and cast member stuck with the traumas and tics that we had when we were kids. Being an adult is essentially just one big struggle to work out the unrealized dreams of youth the grudges and crushes the hurt and the well hurt. Inevitably disillusionment sets in and before you know it youre smoking cigarettes or pot and just acting like a jerk.Set in a time-warped New York City (rotary phones comfortably frayed hotels battered gypsy cabs) Andersons picture is about a deadbeat patriarch Royal Tenenbaum (a brilliant Gene Hackman - give this guy the Oscar) who dead-broke and feeling a twinge of guilt about his years of parental indifference returns to the family manor to spend some quality time with his three grown children and the woman who is technically still his wife. Child geniuses who excelled at finance (Chas - played by Ben Stiller as an adult) tennis (Richie - played by Luke Wilson) and dramaturgy (Margot - a sublimely sullen Gwyneth Paltrow) the Tenenbaum brood has spent decades haunted by its precocious successes and respective and considerable neuroses.Better off is Etheline Tenenbaum (Anjelica Huston) the childrens mother and Royals estranged spouse who has fashioned a life as an urban archaeologist and enthusiast of contract bridge. A suitor (Danny Glover) who also serves as Ethelines accountant comes along promising the one thing she hasnt had in 20-odd years sex. Well two things He truly madly loves the woman too.As he did in Rushmore Anderson orchestrates various dovetailing whimsical melodramas throwing in familiar motifs (fake doctors bedsheet-escapes from institutions) and punctuating particularly poignant moments with perfect 60s and 70s pop (Nick Drake the Velvet Underground Between the Buttons-era Rolling Stones). Because it presents a tangle of characters above and beyond its Tenenbaumian quintet (additional players include Bill Murray as an Oliver Sacks-like therapist Owen Wilson as a hack author and Tenenbaum-wannabe Kumar Pallana as the family manservant and Seymour Cassel as a hotel elevator operator) the film is by nature a messier more ambitious thing than Rushmore. This means that a few threads can be seen unraveling a few actors dont have enough to do (Murray as ever is deadpan hysterical but hes on the periphery) and a few jokes dont fly.But it also means that the interplay among the various Tenenbaums (and friends and foes) is fraught with tension tenderness and terrible sulking fits in ways that only make the experience richer.

The key is that Anderson and Owen Wilson are exceptionally keen sympathetic writers and Anderson extends that specificity to his direction. The music (he remains fond of lilting 60s British invasion plus ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"") production design and cinematography (by repeat Anderson collaborators David Wasco and Robert Yeoman respectively) put you in a time and place governed by their own rules.Only here could one of the biggest laugh lines be ""Push fluids and continue the stomach cancer medication.""

In the ever-expanding roster of twerp filmmakers Mr. Anderson is now located somewhere between Todd Solondz though not as nasty and Richard Linklater though not as relaxed. The humor is curdled deadpan Jim Jarmusch and the ultimate stylistic and thematic model is the J.D. Salinger of The New Yorker . The Royal Tenenbaums is also the most deliberately unreal Anderson film to date. Largely narrated by Alec Baldwin the story of the Tenenbaum family is broken into pseudo-literary segments introduced by opening sentences on a printed page from the chapters of a novel that doesnt exist. In the early days the Tenenbaums boasted three childhood prodigies young Chas (Aram Aslanian-Persico) young Margot (Irene Borovaia) and young Richie (Amedeo Turturro). Chas excels in business Margot in playwriting Richie in tennis and each is labeled a ""genius"" in his or her field. When the patriarch Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) abandons his wife Etheline (Anjelica Houston) the rest of the family proceeds to go all to pieces with the former geniuses growing up to be very mixed-up adults played by Ben Stiller (Chas) Gwyneth Paltrow (Margot) and Luke Wilson (Richie). Margot-who as it turns out was adopted-develops a romance with Richie despite her marriage to self-caricatured behavioral scientist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray) and her affair with longtime neighbor and novelist Eli Cash (Owen Wilson). And Etheline though not divorced from Royal is considering marriage to her rich real-estate employer Henry Sherman (Danny Glover). At this point Royal decides that he misses his family a decision made easier by his being broke and about to be thrown out of his hotel. Pretending to be mortally ill he worms his way back into the house and schemes to break up Ethelines romance with Henry. Have I forgotten anything? Richie attempts suicide Chas loses his wife in a plane accident and Eli develops a destructive drug problem. The eccentricities and neuroses that make up the Tenenbaum cosmos bounce around an imaginary world that bears little resemblance to New York or any other city. Gypsy cabs with the words ""Gypsy Cab"" on the doors can be summoned with a wave. There is no otherness in the movie to provide any social restraint on the most outlandish whims of the Tenenbaums and the privileged members of their circle. The moral if any seems to be that family is ultimately all we have in this life to comfort and console us. The problem here is similar to the one George Orwell discerned in the novels of Charles Dickens Once your characters are endowed with too much color and strangeness its difficult to make them interact with the other characters in a coherent narrative. The Tenenbaums and the equally eccentric characters around them work so hard at being distinctive soloists that they lose contact with the rest of the ensemble. Mr. Anderson is not lacking in cleverness and ingenuity as a filmmaker but it takes something more to produce a dramatically and emotionally satisfying movie. In Kandahar  A Desperate State of Being Moshen Makhmalbafs Kandahar  from his own story screenplay and improvisations was actually shot near the Iranian border with Afghanistan but not in Afghanistan itself since the Taliban had refused him permission. Nonetheless the stream of Afghan refugees to Iran-a large number of them amputees from 20 years of war and mine fields-provide the director with an approximation of the misery in Taliban-governed Afghanistan before the recent upheavals. Mr. Makhmalbaf noted in a recent interview that Afghanistan belonged to Iran 250 years ago and that of the six million Afghans who fled the Taliban two and a half million took refuge in Iran. The story of Kandahar is centered around Nafas (Nelofer Pazira) an Afghan-born female journalist who fled the country as a teenager for Canada. Nafas receives a letter from her sister in Kandahar who has been maimed by a mine and in a further state of despair over the Talibans brutal suppression of women has sworn to commit suicide at the time of the next solar eclipse. Nafas must race across southern Afghanistan to rescue her sister but she must also disguise herself by wearing the Taliban-imposed head-to-toe covering of the burqa. Along the way she witnesses much hunger and suffering as she enlists a series of unreliable or inadequate guides including a mercenary desert urchin a crafty trader and-most helpful of all-a black American activist who has mixed in with the population false beard and all. We never see Nafas reach Kandahar but we have been taken on a colorful and exhilarating trip just the same. The actress who plays Nafas is re-enacting her own pilgrimage from Canada but for the sake of a best friend rather than a sister. There is very little acting in the film only a desperate state of being. Those Lying Eyes Fatih Akins In July  from his own screenplay plays out as a helter-skelter road movie with two shaggy-dog stories for the price of one as it zigzags between Hamburg and Istanbul. The writer-director himself pitches into the chaotic stew to play a Romanian border guard who encounters a nerdy physics teacher Daniel Bannier (Moritz Bleibtreu) in the course of the latters love-driven quest for his Turkish dream girl Melek (Idil Uner). Daniel is accompanied most of the way by Juli (Christiane Paul) his suspiciously dazzling friend who predicts that Daniel will find his true love-all the while casting herself in the role. The romance is always too close to knockabout farce to allow any variations in the formula. From Ms. Pauls first close-up when she charges up the electricity in her eyes the final outcome is preordained. No matter how foolishly Daniel behaves and how long he persists in his delusion that Melek is the girl for him the eyes of Juli will determine his fate. The Turkish presence in Germany has seldom been treated so amiably and despite all the disasters that befall Daniel as he encounters hashish and LSD for the first time when he reaches Istanbul the city seems to bathe him in sunlight as it bestows its blessings on his discovery of true love after a long and grueling search. Ms. Pauls mesmerizing eyes remind me of the old saw about actors on the stage communicating with their voices while actors on the screen communicate with their eyes. Of course its up to the director to find the context in which to release the voltage necessary to seal a loved ones fate. Budd Boetticher (1916-2001) I didnt know director Budd Boetticher personally when I paid tribute to his critically neglected westerns back in the 60s. I had caught them a short time before in the 42nd Street grindhouses during a period when movie research was a much sleazier enterprise than it is today. I had gotten to know him personally only recently along with his lovely wife Mary Chelde to whom I send my deepest condolences. Now Id like to go down memory lane to describe what I thought about Boettichers work in my salad days ""Does anyone know where Budd Boetticher is? The last we heard our gifted friend was on his way to Mexico to make a movie on bullfighting his third. Be that what it may Boetticher is one of the most fascinating unrecognized talents in the American cinema. How many admirers of Peckinpahs Ride the High Country recognize this film as an attempted summation of the incredibly consistent Boetticher-Randolph Scott-Harry Joe Brown series of westerns which from 1956 on established a new style in the genre? Constructed partly as allegorical odysseys and partly as floating poker games in which every character took turns at bluffing about his hand or his draw until the final showdown Boettichers westerns expressed a weary serenity and moral certitude that was contrary to the more neurotic approaches of other directors in this neglected genre of the cinema. ""One wonders where directors like Boetticher find the energy and the inspiration to do such fine work when native critics are so fantastically indifferent that they probably couldnt tell a Boetticher western apart from a Selander or worse. This unyielding taste and dedication in relative obscurity is what makes the American Cinema so exciting and at times so miraculous. ""Whatever his action setting be it the corrida the covered wagon or the underworld Boetticher is no stranger to the nuances of machismo  that overwhelming masculine pride that provides a style and a fatal flaw to his gun-wielding or cape-flourishing characters. Boettichers films strip away the outside world to concentrate on the deadly confrontations of male antagonists. No audience is required for the final showdown. It is man to man in an empty arena on a wide screen before a very quiet elemental camera. Elemental but not elementary. Boettichers timing of action is impeccable. He is not a writer-director like Burt Kennedy or Sam Peckinpah but he is a much better storyteller."" As you can see I was more insistently polemical back in those days and more presumptuous in calling Boetticher a friend when I had never met the man. What I do not regret is calling attention to a career otherwise destined to languish in the shadows. Goodbye Budd. I hope that your movies will give future generations as much pleasure as they gave me.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The breakup of the marriage is the core of the film. The kids now adults are still dealing with Royals neglect--they havent spoken to him in years. Financial whiz Chas (Ben Stiller) a widowed father of two remembers how his dad shot him with a BB gun. Adopted sister Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) a secret smoker unhappily married to neurologist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray hurray) won a 50000 playwriting grant in the ninth grade--Royal didnt like her play (""It didnt seem believable to me""). Retired tennis champ Richie (Luke Wilson) has spent the past year traveling alone on an ocean liner hiding his love for his sister who is having something too woebegone to call a fling with Richie s friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson). In the words of the films narrator (Alec Baldwin) "" . . . All memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbaums had been erased by two decades of betrayal failure and disaster."" The Royal Tenenbaums plays like a New Yorker story that J.D. Salinger never wrote. Set in a Manhattan of the imagination (Royal lives at the 375th Street Y) the film opens--in Magnificent Ambersons-style--like a book with chapter headings. That it works is due to director Wes Anderson who has made something eccentric and hilarious that can suddenly--or maybe not for hours or even days later--choke you up with emotion. Anderson and his Texas chum Owen Wilson have already written two screenplays (Bottle Rocket and Rushmore) that have won them a cult following. The cult should expand exponentially with Tenenbaums. Not because its cast is starrier but because the film has an accessible maturity. Anderson has been accused of overreaching of pushing beyond his capabilities. If so all young filmmakers should have such faults. Anderson has marshaled all the elements of cinema from costumes to production design to create a unique world. Each of the actors is distinctively wonderful including Kumar Pallana as the Tenenbaum major-domo. And Huston amazes as the mother who doesnt know what to do with a marriage proposal from her bridge partner (Danny Glover) or with an ex-husband telling her that hes dying and wants his family back again. Paltrow seems like someone altogether new as Margot and Luke Wilson finds the grieving heart in Richie. But this is a triumph for Hackman. They say he can do no wrong as an actor (we wont mention The Replacements) and the complex comic gravity of his performance proves it. Anderson offers no phony uplift for the Tenenbaums or for audiences. But he does know how to take a sad song and make it better. In these troubled times thats a gift.

So The Royal Tenenbaums -- about a dysfunctional family of geniuses made by a filmmaker who relishes show casing his characters idiosyncracies -- would seem the ideal tonic. One cant help but have high hopes for a movie directed and co-written by Wes Anderson whose previous Bottle Rocket and Rushmore struck just the right notes with a fascinating slew of oddballs. But Andersons third and most star-studded production tries too hard to be dotty. His preoccupation with intriguing but sometimes distracting visual details (a recurring presence of battered Gypsy cabs and homebred Dalmatian mice) seems to supersede his characters development. The story centers on a narcissistic disbarred lawyer aptly named Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman at his best) who abandons his archaeologist wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) and his three young prodigies. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the brilliant but depressed adopted daughter who is the poster child for nurture vs. nature having written a play at 12. Glumly glamorous with her black-rimmed eyes and taste for fur coats shes secretly in love with her former tennis-champ brother played by Luke Wilson. He shares the passion so when she inexplicably marries a dull scientist (Bill Murray wasted in a minimal role) he despairs and ruins his career by throwing a crucial tennis match. Older brother Ben Stiller plays a morose financial whiz who hasnt gotten over his dad shooting him as a child with a BB gun. A widower hes left with two glum boys who share the best scenes with Hackman. Royal decides he wants to regain his role as family patriarch and engineers bizarre and alienating schemes to win his family back. Among them is teaching his serious grandsons to indulge in some irresponsible childish antics. Hackman as the reprehensible Royal is a delight to watch as he demonstrates how to shoplift jaywalk in traffic and throw things at cars. Anderson wrote the film with childhood friend and Rocket co-writer Owen Wilson who has a funny turn as a macho adventure-seeking author. The film grows on you but more substance and less calculated quirks would have been a royal treat.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" marks Wes Anderson as a director whose heart is in the right place The problem is that everything else is out of whack. Theres an awkward self-consciousness to the way he strings scenes together like giant wooden beads that some critics and fans have hailed as visionary in his previous films ""Bottle Rocket"" and particularly ""Rushmore."" But to the rest of us those scenes dont connect in any meaningful rhythm. And thats only the beginning Andersons other hallmarks here are brilliant gags that deflate in the execution potentially interesting characters that end up so flat they feel as if theyd been cut out of paper a plot thats all setup and no story. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" strives to be ambitious and homey at once and even though I want to trust that Andersons impulses are pure the movie is so calculating that I could only imagine Anderson sitting in some darkened room somewhere toting up the laughs and tears on a childs chalkboard. Anderson is the kind of director who with his quirky awkwardness puts distance between his movies and the audience instead of collapsing it. Some people enjoy his style and bridge the distance easily; others like me may feel that hes more interested in his own precocity than he is in his characters. The charm of his bumptiously lauded 1998 ""Rushmore"" eluded me but I will grant that he has a pointed understanding of class issues He realizes that class-based insecurities are much more interesting (and more deep-rooted) than the favorite topic of so many other young filmmakers suburban ennui. (In other words hes not part of the loathsome ""Im so bored out here in my parents big expensive suburban house"" school of filmmaking.) Theres also sincerity in Andersons approach if you have the temperament and the energy to look past his constant smirking to see it. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" especially makes that pretty hard work. Gene Hackman is Royal the taciturn and mostly absentee head of the Tenenbaum family a neurotically grand bunch that has splintered and fallen on hard times. He and his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) have been separated though not divorced for years. Their three offspring each of whom was a child prodigy have grown up and left the nest but all of them feel at sea in the outside world unable to adjust to its relentless rolling and pitching. As a kid Chas (Ben Stiller) started a business breeding Dalmatian mice. Hes now a high-roller tycoon with two kids; hes also a crankily grieving but intensely guarded widower. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a tennis champ until one fateful day he mysteriously flipped out on the court during the match of his career. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) wrote an award-winning play at the age of 9. Now she no longer writes and spends much of her time indoors in her bathtub hiding her secret smoking habit from her adoring Oliver Sacks-like hubby (Bill Murray). Circumstances among them Royals announcement that hes terminally ill cause them all to return to the homestead. And although each is acutely aware of his or her miserable childhood and the neglect and indifference with which Royal treated them (Etheline was always vaguely supportive but distracted) they feel more at home in the big old family house than anywhere else. Anderson spends a great deal of time introducing the characters and explaining their histories. (Theres a voice-over by Alec Baldwin that ""Virgin Suicides""-style outlines everything we need to know.) Anderson captures an aura of wry mournfulness in these flashback tableaux particularly the sight of the child version of Margot in a striped sports dress her hair tucked back with a plastic barrette tapping away solemnly at one of her plays. Set against an instrumental version of ""Hey Jude"" -- a song written for a neglected child -- these vignettes establish a delicately morose mood that the rest of the movie doesnt live up to. For one thing though its splashed with color ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is too flat to be vivid. Each shot is like an inert comic-book panel (and without the intentional angularity that Terry Zweigoff achieved in ""Ghost World"") in which the characters look like lost foreigners. Its faux folk art. You Might Also Like And the story written by Anderson and Owen Wilson (Lukes brother who also appears in the movie doing a loopy turn as a Richie Rich neighbor kid who grows up to be a modern-day Zane Grey) ambles nowhere after that long setup. Theres no dramatic electricity to draw you in or set you buzzing; with few exceptions the characters feelings and motivations are put on-screen in an expository rather than visceral way. Most of the characters particularly Stillers feel vague and unshaped. The device of dressing the present-day characters in grown-up versions of the same clothes they wore as kids feels forced and gimmicky in all cases but one Paltrow her eyes done up in thick smoky rings of kohl slinks around mousily in a big-girls version of that same striped sports dress with a mink coat thrown on top as her one conscious concession to adult mystery and glamour. Shes like a mod version of those elegant spookily remote Edward Gorey ladies. Paltrow has some lovely moments with Luke Wilson particularly a scene in which they huddle in the indoor tent Richie has set up in his old room at the homestead. (The eccentricities pile up in this movie like a heaping platterful of petits fours at a patisserie run by a neurotic baker.) He and Margot connected by a special bond talk to each other in a scene that has an uncharacteristic (for Anderson) low quiet swaying rhythm set to the Rolling Stones elegiac ""She Smiled Sweetly."" (Anderson has a good ear for music recorded before his time; he brings new audiences to it and delights and surprises some older moviegoers too.) Most of the other actors look and feel lost in this 2-D showpiece of a movie. A subplot involving Etheline and her gentleman suitor played by Danny Glover feels particularly patched-in and seems to serve only as an excuse for some forced unfunny banter between Glover and Hackman. But Hackmans Royal crusty enchantingly off-putting and not above cheap fakery if it means earning the love of his family (a love that previously he never had nor wanted) is the one character who resonates every time hes on-screen. Hackman knows just what to do with Anderson and Wilsons lines many of which are -- or more accurately should be -- genuinely funny. In trying to express sympathy to Chazs children (played by Grant Rosenmeyer and Jonah Meyerson they have the snidely poetic names ""Ari"" and ""Uzi"") he sputters the most comforting line he can come up with ""Im very sorry for your loss. Your mother was a very attractive woman."" Realizing that he didnt spend enough time with his own kids he takes Ari and Uzi under his wing. The movies best sequence shows him teaching them to jaywalk and shoplift cartons of juice. One triumphant snippet shows Hackman zipping along on a tiny go-cart Its a grand visual gag. But Hackmans turn only points up the monotonous failed jokes that make ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" so top-heavy and ultimately topple it. A gag involving a gypsy cab is hilarious the first time and exhausting by the eighth. There were dozens of times Id find myself staring in disbelief at the screen realizing that joke after joke was brilliant and yet Id barely laughed at all. Chazs Dalmatian mice -- tiny spotted scampering things -- should have been one of the finest miniature visuals of the year. But when I saw them they just seemed planted and obvious -- a detail so carefully mechanized to delight us that it simply doesnt. The jokes in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" dont tickle you -- they wallop you. Andersons movies have the innocence of a crayoned drawing which is part of what some moviegoers like about him. His ramshackle charm comes with a price though Andersons movies are assertively asexual. They exist in a world where nothing so messy as sex intrudes except at the most basic childlike-crush level. If there are essential nooks and crannies of human experience that Anderson finds yucky and off-putting his alleged brilliance is going to hit the ceiling pretty soon. Meanwhile though his overconfident feyness generally unbecoming in any artist above the age of 8 is already wearing thin. Like those rarefied assertively cute mice hes showing his spots. Its up to us whether to buy them or not. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

"Their Particular Brand of Dysfunction - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Their Particular Brand of DysfunctionThe Royal Tenenbaums the latest from Wes Anderson has a peculiar through-the-looking-glass quality about it.December 14 2001|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC Watching ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is as close as were likely to get to being kidnapped by extraterrestrials and spirited away to their strange world. No nasty probes are not in evidence but theres no doubt youre in the presence of an extremely sophisticated yet completely alien reality.Director Wes Anderson who also co-wrote the ""Royal"" script with actor Owen Wilson unquestionably has one of Americas most distinctive filmmaking sensibilities but that is part of the problem. As my mother used to say too good is no good.Its rare frankly to see a movie that lives inside its own head as completely as this one does. Its like going to a party where everyone speaks a version of a familiar language that cant quite be understood. The words star Gene Hackman has used to describe his character--""very peculiar""--apply to this entire enterprise as well.Densely imagined with the smallest character tendency and the tiniest on-set knickknack predetermined in almost fiendish detail ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is such a hermetic film that the Coen brothers work seems practically Capra-esque by comparison. The difficulty is that it is hard to find any connection points with such an insular forbidding style hard to find the handholds that make the climb inside possible.""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a bleak farce set in an imaginary New York-ish city with landmarks like ""the 375th Street Y"" and ""the Valenzuela Bridge."" Its not about a royal clan like the Windsors but about one mans family the wife and children of Royal Tenenbaum who at one time all resided in an enormous red brick pile that seems imaginary as well but turns out to be an actual house in Harlem not far from where Ralph Ellison wrote ""The Invisible Man.""When the films main action opens only Royals estranged wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) lives in the house. Royal (Hackman) a once-prominent litigator who has been disbarred and imprisoned has been gone for 20 years. So too are the three Tenenbaum children. Once they were child prodigies but after their father left that youthful brilliance a literary voice-over tells us ""was subsequently erased by two decades of betrayal failure and disaster.""Eldest son Chas (Ben Stiller) once a financial mastermind is now after the plane-crash death of his wife reduced to running his two young sons through constant disaster drills. Daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) won a major playwriting grant when she was in the ninth grade but now shes married to neurologist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray) and spends hours at a time sulking and soaking in the tub. Youngest son Richie (Luke Wilson) was a tennis sensation who won the U.S. Nationals three years in a row. After a much-publicized breakdown he now travels the world on tramp steamers. His childhood best friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) is the groups only success having somehow morphed into a cowboy-hat-wearing literary celebrity.In one of those movieland coincidences all three adult Tenenbaum siblings contrive to move back to their childhood home just when their archeologist mother is considering a marriage proposal from her accountant Henry Sherman (Danny Glover). At the very same time father Royal is being evicted from his longtime quarters at the Lindbergh Palace Hotel and needing a place to stay as well. Given the general disrepute in which hes held Royal needs to do some conniving to get a room at this particular inn.His quest is not just lodging; he wants to win his family back to worm his way into their good graces once again. The question is not just whether he can do it it is more to the point whether anyone can be made to care. For one of ""Royals"" drawbacks is that its characters come so completely out of a very specific sensibility that a sameness is created--they seem almost identical. Its as if the irritating Max Fischer character from Andersons ""Rushmore"" has taken over the personalities of everyone in this picture.Adding to this difficulty is that as a director Anderson has carefully and intentionally leeched the energy out of almost every performance leaving actors like Murray and Glover with pitifully little to do. His sensibility is also impervious to any outward show of emotion the idea apparently being that the less feeling his film shows the more we will be forced to supply it ourselves to redress the balance. Its a nice idea but it doesnt work.Though each succeeding project makes Anderson more and more of a media celebrity its hard to fight the feeling that his first picture the neglected ""Bottle Rocket"" was his most satisfying. It had the unmistakable strangeness that is the filmmakers trademark but perhaps because writer-director James Brooks was involved as an executive producer it was more accessible opened more of a window to the outside world. With each succeeding film that window has been closing. Its now shut tight and not surprisingly the atmosphere is stifling.MPAA rating R for some language sexuality/nudity and drug content. Times guidelines more weird than overtly sexual but with a few kinky moments.The Royal TenenbaumsGene Hackman...Royal TenenbaumAnjelica Huston...Etheline TenenbaumBen Stiller...Chas TenenbaumGwyneth Paltrow...Margot TenenbaumLuke Wilson...Richie TenenbaumOwen Wilson...Eli CashBill Murray...Raleigh St. ClairDanny Glover...Henry ShermanReleased by Touchstone Pictures.

But Andersons coy wistfulness is so rigorously organized you feel like he grew the heart in a test tube. The general impression is that of a New Yorker-informed nerd whos determined to get all the pretty girls to kiss him for being so sensitive. Andersons story about three eccentric Manhattan-bred children who strive to reconcile with their long-gone father when he feigns stomach cancer is presented as a cross between John Irving and J.D. Salinger. Chapter headings and quaint illustrations even pop up to offset an undercurrent of droll nihilism. Alec Baldwin supplies dulcet narration that sounds like a popular 11th-grade English teacher seducing his students via a tale thats a little bit funny a little bit sad and a little bit dirty.

"Royal Tenenbaums The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; royal-tenenbaums-the ) Royal Tenenbaums The (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli When I first heard the title of this movie I thought it was a great ploy to release it around Christmas. Then I realized it was ""Tenenbaums"" not ""Tannenbaums""... so much for that idea. Actually Touchstone has elected a year-end release because they believe this movie the third feature from critics darling Wes Anderson (Rushmore) might have a shot at an Oscar or two. Despite the high profile cast which features Gene Hackman Anjelica Huston Ben Stiller Gwyneth Paltrow Owen amp; Luke Wilson Danny Glover and Bill Murray the movie probably has limited box office potential - its a little too quirky for mainstream America. But the mercurial Academy may feel differently about the production than the multiplex masses - at least thats the distributors hope. For those who enjoy skewed deadpan humor The Royal Tenenbaums has enough to sate the appetite. The movie is a twisted satire on the feel-good genre in which an estranged family member returns to the fold and redeems himself. Its Frank Capra crossed with David Lynch with a little Monty Python thrown in on the side. The movie is rarely (if ever) side-splittingly funny but there are so many clever moments that nasty chuckles and devilish smiles come at frequent intervals. The movie doesnt have more heart than Andersons vastly overrated Rushmore but its a smarter more sophisticated endeavor - a clear indication that the filmmaker has grown. The Tenenbaums are dysfunctional in only a way a movie family can be dysfunctional. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) the patriarch is not a good father. Although he and his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) have raised three gifted children all of them have grown up to be burnt-out neurotics with ""issues"". Chas (Ben Stiller) a real estate wheeler-dealer in high school is afraid of his own shadow. Margot a promising playwright (and the adopted daughter) is trapped in a loveless marriage with a much older man (Bill Murray). And Richie a former U.S. Open tennis champion who had the biggest meltdown in the history of the sport pines for his true love - his sister. Royal meanwhile has left the family home to live in a hotel. Although he has never officially divorced Etheline he has not seen her or his children for three years. Then comes the news that Etheline is considering the marriage proposal of Henry Sherman (Danny Glover) and Royal decides he wants to win her back. So faking a terminal illness he returns to the Tenenbaum home - at about the same time that Chas Margot and Richie all show up. Suddenly all the members of this none-too-happy clan are back together under the same roof. The Waltons they arent. Anderson doesnt seem to mind breaking movie taboos. Not only does he have a lot of fun with the incestuous relationship of Richie and Margot but he does something no director seems willing to do these days kill a pet dog. Much of the humor is sly and dry not outrageously flamboyant - very little of it belongs in the same category as that of Owen Wilson and Ben Stillers most recent outing Zoolander or Gwyneth Paltrows entry into the Farrelly Brothers canon Shallow Hal. Dramatically The Royal Tenenbaums is on uncertain ground. Anderson wants the characters to grow on us and seems to believe that Royals Scrooge-like transformation should have some meaning but it doesnt really work. The reason has to do with Andersons style. He is a master of understatement; all of his actors underplay their parts. That works to emphasize the satirical elements but distances us from the characters. Still while Anderson would like it if The Royal Tenenbaums strikes an emotional chord thats not his primary goal. He wants us to laugh far more than he wants us to cry and in that aim he succeeds. With the names in this cast it may come as a surprise that the best performance is given by Gwyneth Paltrow whose mannered portrayal of Margot shows hints of tremendous turmoil just beneath a seemingly placid exterior. She is nearly matched by Gene Hackman although Hackman has the easier character to portray since the only thing Royal is hiding is the truth. Ben Stiller essays the kind of on-edge individual hes good at and Luke Wilson manages to hold his own although just barely. (His more charismatic brother Owen takes a supporting role and is careful not to eclipse Luke.) In a way expectations may be The Royal Tenenbaums greatest adversary. Stiller/Wilson fans anticipating another Meet the Parents or Zoolander will find themselves adrift in unexpectedly offbeat and cerebral territory. There are no flatulence jokes and little in the way of physical humor. The tone is dark not feather-light and the thinking viewer will definitely derive more from this movie than the one who approaches it mindlessly. Lovers of Rushmore will probably be delighted but The Royal Tenenbaums contains enough that even those who were put off by the earlier movie may find something here worth savoring.
