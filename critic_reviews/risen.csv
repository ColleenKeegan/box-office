It is literally not the case in Risen a clever evocatively-told twist on the crucifixion story. Risen is the story of a cynical war-weary Roman tribune named Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) whos called away from the battlefield to Judea by his erstwhile mentor Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth). His mission to investigate and debunk the obvious hoax of a resurrected prophet named Yeshua (Fear the Walking Deads Cliff Curtis). Actually his initial assignment is to prevent the theft of said prophets body after his execution Pilate having anticipated that such an act was planned to validate predictions of Christs resurrection. But that simple security measure goes awry. Sony-backed Affirm Films one of the key production partners has found commercial success making faith-driven films that are undeniably entertaining to non-believers (like me). Among these Soul Surfer the true story of surf champion Bethany Hamilton who staged a comeback after losing her arm to a shark and the cop movie Courageous. In both those movies the protagonists Christianity was tangential to a compelling story. Risen is a little more on point. Suffice to say that though we see half the movie through the eyes of a guy who worships Mars the God of War the movie eventually sets aside ambiguity and lays its cards on the table. But if skeptics are willing to suspend disbelief for entertainment purposes with Harry Potter they can do the same here. Risen has two acts both fairly well done. The first - following a brutal battle scene that conveys the efficiency of Roman military tactics - is more or less a detective story. Clavius and his hero-worshipping ambitious young protege Lucius (Tom Felton from the aforementioned Potter) proceed to interview various followers of Yeshua - including the Apostles and Mary Magdelene (Maria Botto) with tactics varying from compassion to brutality. In every case they encounter people who are so frustratingly blissed-out they could be on Ecstasy. But an investigative imperative will prevail and eventually Clavius does find a body he identifies as Yeshuas. The second act is Fiennes acting showcase his reaction to encountering a living breathing Yeshua. To his credit and those of the screenwriters the supernaturalism he encounters does not turn him into one of the rapturous. He stands apart from the faithful throughout clearly shaken in his beliefs but still not one of them. This is where an actor of Fiennes caliber lifts a story like Risen beyond Sunday school. In fact the acting is top-notch across the board. Firths Pilate is a consummate politician only caring about the Yeshua business because unrest would embarrass him on the eve of a visit by the Emperor. (All of Risen is historical fiction. There is no historical Roman mention of Christianity until decades after the fact). Felton manages to fall a touch below the snottiness of Draco Malfoy with a single human act. And Curtis isnt required to do much as Yeshua but look beatific. But its nice to finally see the Messiah portrayed by somebody whod probably get extra attention at a U.S. airport by Homeland Security.

"Review Biblical epic Risen flaunts a Game of Thrones style - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Biblical epic Risen starring Joseph Fiennes flaunts a Game of Thrones style Risen Rosie Collins / Columbia Pictures Joseph Fiennes right portrays a Roman tribune and Tom Felton is his aide in the biblical epic ""Risen."" Joseph Fiennes right portrays a Roman tribune and Tom Felton is his aide in the biblical epic ""Risen."" (Rosie Collins / Columbia Pictures) Katie Walsh ""Risen"" the biblical epic arriving in theaters during Lent to get audiences hyped for Easter plays as fascinating counter-programming for one of Februarys other auspicious releases. The film puts a grimily modern lens on the Resurrection story of Jesus with a Roman tribune (Joseph Fiennes) discovering salvation in Christ.Directed by Kevin Reynolds it arrives just a few weeks after the bow of the Coen brothers classical Hollywood tribute ""Hail Caesar"" in which George Clooney plays an actor playing a Roman tribune who finds salvation in Christ. ""Risen"" has an ""everything old is new again"" feel harking to the time when sword-and-sandal religious epics ruled the studios while also freshening up a familiar Bible story with the grit and wry humor of contemporary historical properties.

Thanks to ""Olympia"" filmmaker Leni Riefenstahls two-part documentary fantasia on the 1936 Berlin Olympics the eternal film image of Jesse Owens is that of a calm then fiercely competitive then jubilant American dominating the Germans and everyone else in the air (the long jump) and on the... (Michael Phillips) Youre probably already familiar with the Easter story and thats one of the issues with ""Risen"" -- you know where things are going so its hard to sustain patience while the incredulous characters play catch up. Fiennes is tribune Clavius who answers to scheming Roman bureaucrat Pilate (Peter Firth) a man overly concerned with the optics of his political career. Clavius and his men carry out the brutal realities of Pilates word inured to the violence of crucifixion and disposal of bodies. One victim whom they call ""the Nazarene"" just wont die so they finish the job and with Pilates approval allow his loved ones to give him a proper burial sealed in a tomb. The Jewish rabbis offer predominantly political reasons for the seal -- he claimed he would rise again so they want to make sure his disciples dont steal the body. Pilate wants to contain any Messiah figures that might threaten his station.So when the corpse goes missing Clavius amp; Co. set off on a process of ""CSI Jesus"" tracking down every disciple friend and follower unearthing fly-ridden corpses turning Jerusalem topsy-turvy at Pilates behest. Its an original and inventive way to illuminate the well-known story bringing a sense of rotting-flesh reality to this whole resurrection business. It also ensures that this Nazarene was absolutely deader than dead his reappearance a true magical miracle. This is the case when Clavius meets Yeshua himself -- a beatific and groovy Cliff Curtis and his tribe of merry men.Because ""Risen"" doesnt dare push biblical boundaries the only way in which it feels compelling or fresh is in the way that it rebrands this content. The messages and meaning remain the same but the style and tone are modified for an audience accustomed to the bloody dusty visages and sweeping landscapes of something like ""Game of Thrones."" See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story ""Risen"" as written by Reynolds and Paul Aiello sacrifices the far more interesting political intricacies and machinations to dwell on a touchy-feely representation of Jesus Christ replete with sunrises and moonbeams. The concept of unwavering faith in Yeshua is the driving message throughout ""Risen"" but in upholding this moral it fails the cinematic story. Theres no nuance to these characters who spout vague spiritual truisms and hokey one-liners punctuated with unrelenting grinning and group hugging. ""Thats why"" exclaims a punchy Bartholomew as Yeshua embraces a leper no other explanation needed or offered. ""Risen"" is a fascinating cultural artifact but as a film its destined for no glory greater than as an appropriate cable rerun on Easter.------------RisenMPAA rating PG-13 for biblical violence including some disturbing imagesRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesPlaying In general releas Walsh is a Tribune News Service critic.

Did you find him ... different?"" Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) asks this of Joseph Fienness Roman tribune Clavius early on in the new Biblical filmA Risen. ""I found him dead"" is Claviuss curt response. They are speaking of the crucifixion itself -- an unfussy affair treated admirably free of sentimentality in this low-key faith-based drama. Its the kind of dry exchange that helps lend a quiet authenticity to the film directed and co-written by Kevin Reynolds. Clavius is a gruff veteran Roman officer tasked by Pilate of overseeing Jesuss entombment and investigating his whereabouts after the prophets body goes missing. It perhaps goes without saying that Claviuss cynicism will eventually be defeated once he finds out what ""really"" happened to Jesus. But for much of its running timeA RisenA plays out like a no-nonsense procedural as Clavius interrogates a variety of apostles soldiers and others in an effort to get to the truth. Its a novel way to tell an oft-told tale. Mostly free of overt piety (at least in its first half) Risen situates itself in the political and spiritual atmosphere of the period Clavius is busy putting down rebellions left and right; Pilate worried about an upcoming visit by the Emperor wants to quell the tensions in the area. A crucified prophet gone missing is the last thing anyone needs right now. ""Without a corpse to prove hes dead we have a potential Messiah"" says Caiaphas (Stephen Greif) the Jewish high priest. (The Sanhedrin dont quite get the skewering here that they do in other films like Passion of the Christ but they are very much in cahoots with the Romans in desperately seeking to suppress any sign of dissent.) As Clavius investigates accompanied by his aide-de-camp Lucius (Tom Felton of Harry Potter fame) Reynolds grounds the film in physical reality as well. We see the mass graves of those executed by the Romans - decaying bodies wasted faces sliced-off limbs. (Is this movie really PG-13?) Its not gratuitous or exploitative but rather a window into the protagonists mind. Clavius has been fighting Romes battles for so long hes jaded numb to suffering and pain and carnage. And Fiennes portrays him as a man with a perpetual cloud over his head with a thousand-yard stare and a terse tongue to match. When asked what he longs for his response comes wearily ""A day without death."" Its clear he knows he wont find it in this life. Though more aloof Pilate is also resigned to the misery around him. ""What does it all matter really?"" he says looking at a mans decomposing body. ""In a few years thats us."" Oh ye of little faith. That brings us to the Jesus part of this Jesus tale. Exclusively referred to as Yeshua here hes played by the part-Maori actor Cliff Curtis a veteran performer who has covered pretty much every ethnicity on the planet (from an Arab in Three Kings to Pablo Escobar in Blow.) Refreshingly this is a Jesus who actually looks like he might have lived in ancient Judea. But its smart casting for other reasons too A constant scene-stealer Curtis has perfected the art of conveying the world in a simple glance ideal for a film in which his character is largely a defining absence. We see just a glimpse of his dying face during the crucifixion itself and in little moments throughout. Each time he seems both approachable and mysterious. Thats a tough thin line to walk but for much of its running time Risen benefits from Reynoldss grounded economical direction. One of the most notoriously beaten-down auteurs of the 1990s the director made his name with the stylishly silly Robin Hood Prince of Thieves starring frequent collaborator Kevin Costner. That partnership went south with the catastrophe of Waterworld a mostly solid occasionally bloated action-adventure that suffered toxic buzz around its immense price-tag and Costners grandiose ways. (This was back when being the most expensive Hollywood film in history was a mark of shame not a selling point.) Reynoldss work has been uneven since then though his hit adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo was a bright spot. While nobody will mistake him for Martin Scorsese his films usually demonstrate a nice mix of atmosphere and grit. He tells mythic heroic stories but he usually finds convincing ways into them placing us in these worlds. That works well in Risen ... until it doesnt. As you might expect the God stuff eventually becomes more pronounced. This is a film produced by Sonys faith-based handle Affirm Films and aimed at the evangelical market so we do get some (clunky) pyrotechnics and worshipful looks by the time its all over. But still for a film that could have easily become bogged down in Sunday School reverence or culture-war opportunism Risen presents an intriguing oblique approach to a Bible movie.

Peter Firth (left) as Pontius Pilate and Joseph Fiennes as Clavius in ""Risen."" Photo Rosie Collins Associated Press Risen an earthy view of miraculous events 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The abundance of biblical epics over the decades has left behind a minefield of movie cliches. The result is that with the slightest misstep the most pious and well-intentioned film can explode into unintended farce. The only hope is to devise a brand-new strategy and thats what we find in ""Risen"" a movie thats different not only in its point of view but also in its presentation of biblical events. The movies whole approach is secular. To be sure the movie is ultimately a critique of secularism but its a shrewd critique one that begins by persuading us to root for the Romans against a mob of Jewish insurgents. After all the Jews look like a bunch of scruffy humorless religious fanatics while the Romans are efficient well groomed and ironic. They seem like people who can actually run an empire and probably should. At the head of the small Roman force is the military tribune Clavius played by a sturdy-looking Joseph Fiennes. Clavius is an ambitious guy just putting in his time in some miserable outpost of the empire. His boss is Pontius Pilate who has no idea that he has just stepped into history by crucifying Yeshua a Nazarene religious zealot. Clavius arrives at the scene of the crucifixion in its final minutes and the sight is squalid and horrible -- but also in the most dispiriting possible way routine. That would seem to be the end of a very minor chapter in Clavius life but the Jewish high priest Caiaphas shows up insisting that the Romans guard the tomb. Caiaphas is worried that Yeshuas associates might steal the body and proclaim his resurrection and so Clavius gets the job of sealing the tomb and appointing guards to stand watch. You pretty much know what happens from there but how its all perceived by the characters and by the audience makes ""Risen"" a different kind of experience. In every biblical epic of the 1950s the Romans were effete and had English accents while the Jews were more or less like the audience. But here the Romans are like us -- modern people with recognizable worldviews and life plans living amid a poverty-ridden backward and superstitious culture. At least a third of the movie is like a detective story with Clavius and an assistant questioning witnesses trying to locate a dead body. Here and there are little hints that maybe its not so great being a Roman. In a reflective moment Pilate asks Clavius what the younger man hopes to achieve through worldly success. His reply tells us that all Clavius really wants is to work like a dog in the hope of a little peace at the end of his life. A bit later Pilate points to a corpse and tells Clavius ""In a few years thats us."" The secular life is attractive and recognizable but a dead end. Every biblical epic treats Jesus disciples as either gentle simpletons or wooden idols but in ""Risen"" they are just normal men from various ages and backgrounds trying to process the miraculous. Bartholomew (Stephen Hagan) is like a proto-hippie freaking out at the delight of it all while Peter is a middle-aged no-nonsense fisherman just trying to keep up with events. And Jesus (Cliff Curtis) instead of speaking like an oracle (like say Jeffrey Hunter in ""King of Kings"") is calm benevolent and baffling. The difference between ""Risen"" and other biblical films perhaps can best be described in this way Here whenever the miraculous happens it happens on an otherwise unremarkable day. And so people react as they would -- they are transformed and yet theyre not. Theyre astonished and yet normal reality surrounds them so that its hard to believe their own eyes. At one point Clavius is sitting with Jesus expressing his religious doubts even after all that he has seen. And yet this doesnt seem at all strange. We understand. Director Kevin Reynolds who also co-wrote the script doesnt strive to lift audiences up into the sky. He keeps one foot on the ground and lets you experience it as the people must have 2000 years ago. Whatever your religious affiliation you will come away thinking that if all this did actually happen it probably happened something like this.

Courtesy Columbia Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The centerpiece of Hail Caesars mid-century Hollywood satire is the eponymous film-within-a-film itself an overwrought biblical epic in which a skeptical Roman centurion played by George Clooney has a literal come-to-Jesus moment. Risen whose plot can be described in exactly the same way never inspires one of its own.Co-writer/director Kevin Reynolds doesnt give the same graphic play-by-play of the crucifixion that The Passion of the Christ did instead using death and resurrection as the occasion for a proto-police procedural. Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) is called upon by Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) to locate the Nazarenes missing body -- the name Jesus Christ is never uttered -- lest his followers claim he has indeed returned from his tomb thus calling established order into question. Cliff Curtis is appealingly low-key as Christ humble in a way that the film around him would have done well to emulate.Film Details Risen RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time107 min. More Info Trailer Despite not doing much more than preach to the choir Risen is still more nuanced than the lions share of recent faith-based dramas. Clavius characterization is easily its most three-dimensional aspect; less hateful oppressor than overworked middle manager he regards his mission not as a polytheistic call to arms but as a fire he has to put out in order to get some rest and move on to whatevers next. That the film itself is never as doubtful of whats transpiring as he is makes his eventual revelation feel like a matter of course free of the grand dramatic heft its we-told-you-so plotting precludes.

Think of it as a two-hour episode of CSI Jerusalem about Jesuss missing body. Amy Nicholson 02/19/2016 TheAmyNicholson The Bible is the best-selling book of all time thanks to its popularity in churches and hotels. But Kevin Reynoldss Risen a thriller set in 33 A.D. had the brainstorm Would it be more popular if we rewrote it like an airport paperback read on a plane? Its the New Testament meets CSI Jerusalem starring ambitious -- and fictitious -- Roman cop Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) Pontius Pilates top enforcer whos been tasked to suppress rebellion in the Holy Land where a new messiah anoints himself every week. The Witch Better Not Have Your Money To the Roman officials this Nazarene whats-his-name is just another crackpot or as Clavius groans ""a crazy poor dead Jew."" Shrugs Pilate ""I had to crucify him."" Nothing personal. The Romans sometimes executed hundreds of people a day. Pilate (Peter Firth) doesnt seriously think Jesus -- here called Yeshua in the movies pretense of sounding historically accurate -- would supplant his own Mars and Minerva. Jesus has to go because he started a small riot in Jerusalems most sacred temple. (Picture Fox Newss outrage when a Ferguson protester burned a CVS and triple it.) And he also has to go because in the Roman Empire religion is politics. When the Caesar family claim to be gods some guy convincing his own followers to call him the King of the Jews isnt just cuckoo -- its treasonous. No matter what your take is on Jesuss death you have to admit that this true-life assassination had a staggering epilogue. Two thousand years ago a young man -- arguably black -- was murdered by the local police. (To avoid controversy Risen cleverly cast its Jesus to be played by Cliff Curtis a Maori actor famous for being able to pass as various ethnicities.) The victims friends wrote and shared defenses of his actions -- early viral think pieces -- and two millennia later the dead man is a deity. Imagine time-traveling to 4016 and discovering a billion people praying to Malcolm X. The best parts of Risen plod along with a flat-footed realism that reminds us that everything that happened after Jesus died was a surprise. When Pilate discovers that the zealots corpse has disappeared he panics. Those damned disciples must have stolen it to start a revolution -- awful timing as Emperor Tiberius is visiting the city in two weeks. Like an angry sergeant in an NYPD drama Pilate orders Clavius to find the body or else saddling him with a newbie partner Lucius (Tom Felton) who has a wimpy blonde mustache that looks embarrassed to be clinging to his face. Clavius a pagan never considers that the culprit could be Christ himself. ""The disciples are key"" he barks to Lucius. ""Find them find him."" The investigation section of the film ticks by like an episode of 24 or really 48 the number of hours before a rotten corpse is unrecognizable. (At least Kiefer Sutherland gets tidy morgues with cold crisper drawers.) The whole thing is sillier than the bleached taupe cinematography would have you believe. I snorted happily when Clavius slammed an hourglass on his desk instead of a digital clock and giggled at the recognizable cliches disguised by togas Claviuss late night in the office hunting for clues in the shroud of Turin (""Sweat and herbs"") his forensic examination of the broken ropes that sealed Jesuss tomb (""Its as if they burst""). Other nods are more pointed about how we treat todays zealots as when Clavius assumes the disciples have a stockpile of weapons and later likens the pain of crucification to ""sucking air through a wet cloth"" -- a description of waterboarding. Focus FeaturesWhen Clavius and Lucius start hauling in eyewitnesses Risen becomes a good centurion/bad centurion farce. Before a stakeout when Clavius asks his soldiers who among them can identify Mary Magdalene (Maria Botto) the worlds most famous prostitute half of the barracks raise their hands. After Magdalene stonewalls Lucius offers ""Should I have her stoned?"" Maybe that threat explains why Stephen Hagan plays the disciple Bartholomew like the second coming of Sean Penns Spicoli. No wonder Clavius rolls his eyes when this half-brained hippie says Jesus promised him eternal life. Eventually sensible Clavius is stunned by the supernatural twist we all know is coming. Risen is the rare movie I wished were more banal. All this pragmatism is a plot trick If even Clavius scraps science for spirituality then the movie figures its audience also has to be swayed. The upside is that at least the resurrected Jesus doesnt really preach. Instead hes happy just to kick it with his buddies and transform a leper into a Mark Ruffalo clone. In fact Curtis plays his Jesus so cool that he still seems half-dead or maybe just high on Bartholomews stash. No wonder Clavius might prefer serving chill-dude Jesus to Pilate a tyrant who threatens to reassign him to ""a post in Hell."" At this I raised an eyebrow. Wouldnt a Roman pagan say ""Hades""? Then I realized that Risen had suckered me into trusting that it was more realistic than the cop thrillers on TV. My penance four fistfuls of popcorn the apropos communion for a goofy night at the movies.

Essentially a biblical detective story that begins as a Roman-led hunt for a missing messiah gone from his tomb then grows into a semicompelling quest for something higher Risen has sincerity and honest spiritual grappling on its side. All thats missing from the movies early interrogations is that clanging Law amp; Order noise as battle-exhausted military tribune Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) calls in various Jewish caricatures for questioning confers with a scowling Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) and runs down leads. (Claviuss hot-headed aide is played by Draco Malfoy himself Harry Potters Tom Felton.) Bursting into a private get-together attended by the stigmata-marked Jesus--here referred to throughout by his Jewish name Yeshua (a serene Cliff Curtis)--Clavius is stunned and falls to the floor. He follows the group into the desert shedding his armor. Director Kevin Reynolds is no Martin Scorsese Once upon a time he made Waterworld a sin for which he should still be atoning. But he does linger on Fienness heavy brow an appreciable shift to capturing an internal disquiet. The actor follows suit sometimes approaching a hangdog Roy Scheider-esque confusion that shades the movie nicely. The back half of Risen is stronger cutting through occasionally cheesy special effects with some well-written conversations about religious awakening. (Fiennes doesnt exactly ""squint against the grandeur"" per the Coens remarkably similar Hail Caesar but comes close.) Its not often that faith-based films competing in the same marketplace that rewards action embrace the deeper more difficult idea of meeting hate with love but Risen tries. Its a drama that neither seeks to convert viewers nor confront true believers with anything uncomfortable--only reaffirm their bedrock convictions the ones that are worth repeating.

Maybe something like ""Risen"" a new faith-based movie set in the days following Jesus death which derives its dusty grittiness from maimings fanciful threats a mordant wit and intricate plays for power. Add its small sets sublime vistas exquisite period costumes and calculating antihero and youve got a fairly ambitious picture tailor-made for that slice of the Christian audience accustomed to the tropes and beats of prestige cable dramas. The pretty-close-to-good ""Risen"" is the first religious movie Ive ever considered recommending to non-believers. Centered on the search for Jesus cadaver after his crucifixion the films first half is a brisk diverting dryly funny procedural with a serious sociological quandary To what lengths should one go to prevent devout fanatics from destabilizing an already troubled city? Roman official Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) is ordered to locate the missing body -- rumored to be walking around alive once more per its owners prophecy -- by Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) who wants to ensure that the unhappy Jewish minority not make any trouble during the emperors imminent visit despite the recent public execution of one of its religious leaders. Also Read Joseph Fiennes Defends Playing Michael Jackson No Ones Trying to Do an Exact Impersonation For Sunday school alums Clavius conversion story will be a familiar one; there are unmistakable echoes of the Apostle Paul a brutal oppressor of early Christians until he became one himself after a celestial intervention. But the delights are in the details the world around Clavius is recognizable enough to contain guards griping about their overtime shifts and the PTSD symptoms of a witness who cant quite bring himself to believe the resurrection of Jesus (Cliff Curtis ""Fear the Walking Dead"") -- its simply too reality-shattering to think about without a round of drinks. Then there are the cable-drama touches. Helmer Kevin Reynolds (""Waterworld"" ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"") stuffs in as much gore as a PG-13 rating will allow including blood seeping out of Jesus eyes (a ""True Blood"" staple) and corpses in various states of decomposition. ""I can have what I want pulled from you"" Clavius menaces softly attempting to scare Mary Magdalene (Maria Botto) out of her uncooperative silence. Later he threatens disciple Bartholomew (Stephen Hagan) with Jesus fate showing him the kind of rough-hewn nail -- thick as a finger long as a hand -- thatll be driven into his extremities if he doesnt start talking. Also Read Stacey Dash Is Thrilled a White Actor Is Playing Michael Jackson The most impressive feature in Reynolds and Paul Aiellos script though might be its rejoinders. Charmingly Fiennes and Firth make the most of their back-and-forths. Standing before a blood-soaked post-battle Clavius Pilate teases ""Did you win?"" When Apostle Peter receives a reflexive slash across his calf for sneaking up on the Roman enforcer the future saint keeps ribbing Clavius in a way that quickly establishes their instant fraternity. But after Clavius comes to face with face with the dead man hed been searching for -- and is thus forced to reconcile what he used to know about the world with the new reality in front of him -- the movie quickly stretches out into eternity. After Judas Iscariots (off-screen) suicide Clavius becomes in essence the twelfth disciple waiting with the rest for His return wishing and hoping and thinking and praying. Despite the gorgeous mountains where the dirt-streaked dozen are nestled watching people sit around anticipating something to happen is about as interesting as it sounds. See Video Gods of Egypt Trailer Sees Gerard Butler on a Path of Destruction When Clavius finally gets close enough to reach out and touch the divine well like most famous people theyre rarely all that youve hyped them up to be in your head. (Clavius would disagree but hes lost to starstruck-dom.) Unlike the first half which felt like a fresh look at Biblical events from an unfamiliar POV the latter section simply recreates the end of the Gospel of Matthew with little of the urgency or humanity that fueled it before. A leper cured of his deformations toward the films end looks less impressed than if hed seen the Miracle Mop in action. And if hes got no reason to be moved neither do we.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 19 2016 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 19 2016 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Kevin Reynolds Written by Kevin Reynolds Paul Aiello Starring Joseph Fiennes Tom Felton Classification PG Genre drama Year 2016 Country USA Language English In one of the early scenes in the new biblical epic Risen the Roman tribune Clavius returns from battling messianic Judean rebels to discover that his helpful boss has destabilized things yet further by crucifying some pesky prophet from Nazareth. Just as you are savouring the delicious irony here - the most famous scene in Western history has taken place off-camera before the audience has even arrived - the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate justifies himself in the language of a contemporary police chief whinging to Clavius ""I had a situation."" At that any hope that the clever concept behind Risen might produce a clever movie is thrown to the ground where it lies quivering for the next hour or so before expiring noisily in the films second half.The concept is that the film is told from the Roman point of view or as the producers of Risen like to advertise it the view of a non-believer. Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) is a hard-working and ambitious Roman officer trying to rise in the ranks by keeping the peace - or suppressing the locals - in the province of Judea and the peace is definitely threatened by the Nazarene whose followers seem to believe he will now rise from the dead. Sensing an existential threat the rabbis insist the Romans guard the tomb to ensure those followers cant snatch the body away and claim a resurrection. But of course on the third day the body mysteriously disappears.There follows a more-or-less exciting attempt at a thriller as Clavius runs around Jerusalem digging up corpses and tracking disciples in an attempt to find out where Yeshuas body went. Directed by Kevin Reynolds who co-wrote the script with Paul Aiello the film features a lush historical setting and some satisfying action scenes but the dialogue is often laughable a mix of the pseudo-archaic with oddly contemporary lingo. Pilate who Peter Firth renders as an exasperated colonial functionary is always saying things like ""Your ambition is noted"" or ""I am for bed"" while at one point somebody actually describes Yeshua as ""special.""Meanwhile the resolution to his disappearance is both annoyingly abstract and ploddingly unmysterious Where has the missing man gone? Turns out he has risen to sit on the right hand of God. Reynolds and his cast strive mightily to capture what it is that inspires Mary Magdalene (Maria Botto) and various of the disciples but mainly the first Christians sound like people who have overindulged in happy drugs. They are smiley and harmless but not very coherent. (Although to be fair as the big guy himself the Maori actor Cliff Curtis does radiate a certain magnetic certitude in his few appearances.) The experience of revelation or spiritual ecstasy is an exceedingly difficult thing to represent on film. God only knows what the Coen brothers are trying to say about religion in their recent comedy Hail Caesar but it does contain a rather amusing spoof of that overstuffed moment when the infidel sees ""the Christ"" for what He is.Here in an attempt to depict revelation seriously Fienness hitherto admirably macho and tough-minded Clavius goes all goopy replacing an impressive glare with a slack smile as both the performance and the film lose all momentum.No atheist or infidel is going to be converted by this nonsense produced by Sony subsidiary Affirm Films in the name of ""wholesome and trusted entertainment."" Even the lapsed or perfunctory Christian seems likely to bristle at the films didacticism and wonder at Reynoldss decision to insert Clavius as some 13th disciple into the post-Resurrection meeting at Galilee.Perhaps the born-again will thrill to a story that echoes their own journeys toward faith but I would have thought many ardent believers might also be troubled by Reynoldss presumption. The revisionist theology becomes particularly questionable when Clavius actually saves the disciples from the Romans thereby permitting them to continue to Galilee and receive their mission.Hail Clavius Apparently without him there would be no Gospel. His story on the other hand could have happily remained untold.

VPCJoseph Fiennes stars as a Roman tribune who is ordered to find the body of Jesus after the crucifixion in Kevin Reynolds film. Well-enough made but not particularly challenging.Joseph Fiennes stars as a Roman soldier charged with investigating the resurrection of Christ in ""Risen.""(Photo Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 stars out of 5Fiennes in particular is good as a non-believer who is converted to a follow of JesusThere is plenty for faith-based audiences to latch onto but the story is pretty straightforwardThe tagline for ""Risen"" gives you some idea of what the filmmakers have in mind ""Witness the manhunt that changed the course of human history.""There was a manhunt? For Jesus? In this story yes.The film directed and co-written by Kevin Reynolds (""Fandango"" um ""Waterworld"") is a nice-enough telling of the Resurrection of Jesus which at times seems like it also wants to be a Very Special Episode of ""CSI Jerusalem."" Its well-made and well-acted particularly by Joseph Fiennes as Clavius a Roman tribune whom Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) assigns to find the missing body of Yeshua (Cliff Curtis) or Jesus. But truly the original story has held up pretty well over the years no?Pontius laments to Clavius that his ordered crucifixion of Yeshua was unlike any punishment he had ever called for. Now hes worried Yeshuas followers will steal his body and claim the crucified man rose from the dead as he said he would.Clavius shows up for the tail end of the crucifixion as Yeshua and the two men crucified alongside him die. Pontius has ordered their legs broken and Clavius follows through on the command.AZCENTRALRisen (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsHe allows Yeshuas followers to take Yeshuas body and put it in a tomb. (The other two men are dumped into a fetid mass grave.) The tomb is sealed and Clavius assigns a couple of guards to protect it to keep anyone from taking the body. One guard pulls out a wineskin after everyone else has gone -- they werent exactly geniuses to begin with -- and sure enough the next day Yeshua is gone.It doesnt take Clavius long to deduce the guards story doesnt hold water. Thus begins the manhunt though its mostly conducted by two people Clavius and his sidekick Lucius (Tom Felton). Neither believes Yeshua could have been resurrected. Clavius in fact prays to Mars and his goal in life is to make enough money to have a house in the country without any of his current stress -- ""a day without death.""Clavius (Joseph Fiennes left) warns Lucius (Tom Felton) to let them all pass after he discovers him leading the apostles away from the Roman soldiers in a scene from ""Risen."" (Photo Columbia Pictures)But first hes going to have to locate Yeshua. He and Lucius interrogate townspeople but they dont really get anywhere. Someone mentions a former prostitute named Mary Magdeline (Maria Botto) but her answers seem cryptic. Finally Clavius hits upon an idea Find the apostles he figures and hell find Yeshua.Its a solid plan and from that point ""Risen"" becomes a pretty straightforward conversion story with Clavius a sort of Forrest Gump of the Gospels. Hes on hand when Thomas doubts are satisfied and he witnesses a couple of miracles (ones that more typically occur before the crucifixion).Its all perfectly fine though for a story told from a non-believers point of view (at least at first) its not especially challenging. But it is several steps up from some faith-based fare and it will doubtless appeal to its target audience. Whether it will convert non-believers as readily as Clavius remains to be seen.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebookfacebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Joseph Fiennes plays Clavius an officer in the Roman military tasked to find out why Jesus tomb has gone empty. Think of it as ""CSI Nazareth"" and Clavius as your David Caruso. All thats missing is a pair of sunglasses and a theme song by the Who.He tracks down witnesses kicks down doors (there is never ever any knocking) and conducts interviews with Christs followers all at the orders of Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) who is looking to quell an uprising among the people.Clavius is stern smart and determined to find answers and for its first half or so ""Risen"" is a compelling competent take on the familiar story. But once Clavius finally lays his eyes on Cliff Curtis Yeshua (the Hebrew name for Jesus) he and the movie become quivering piles of mush.Director Kevin Reynolds (""Waterworld"") who co-wrote the screenplay with Paul Aiello pivots in the movies second half and has Clavius join a team of Christs followers on a mission into the desert. Hes a reluctant believer but is converted when he sees Yeshua fix a mans deeply mangled face and fill a net with fish miracles he pulls off with the confidence and swagger of a table magician.Yeshua is bathed in adoring light and his smile beams with the light of 1000 burning suns. No wonder Clavius is so enamored by him. The turnabout renders the first half of the film something of a fake out but ""Risen"" was never meant as anything but a tool for the converted.

Mel Gibsons extraordinary The Passion of the Christ is the rare exception that proves the rule - most films in that crowded genre are tired derivative affairs. Its all the more reason to celebrate Risen a modestly budgeted drama set in the days following Jesus crucifixion and resurrection. A faith-based Christian film co-written and directed by Kevin Reynolds (Tristan amp; Isolde Hatfields amp; McCoys) Risen is an innovative narrative that tells Jesus story from the point of view of a most unusual character a fictional Roman official named Clavius who helped execute Jesus in the first place. Portrayed by Joseph Fiennes as a charismatic intensely intelligent army officer Clavius and his assistant (Harry Potters Tom Felten) are asked by Pontius Pilate (MI5s Peter Firth) to find out how Jesus body disappeared from his tomb. Slowly the Roman wakes up to the truth of what Jesus followers preach. Risen which features Cliff Curtis (Training Day) as Jesus plays like a clever procedural. While it descends too often into the melodramatic its a solid smart picture and a welcome addition to the genre. tirdadphillynews.com 215-854-2736 Published February 19 2016 -- 1025 AM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer Continue Reading More in entertainment Steven Rea > Philly director from NoLibs making waves in Hollywood Television > HBO confirms end to Game of Thrones but spinoffs still possible Celebrities amp; Gossip > Clintons party at Kimmel Center post-acceptance speech Austin folkie Sarah Jarosz goes to the head of her class with album tour Folk music is a rich fine palate for Sarah Jarosz the classically trained but rustic singer/songwriter coming to Ardmore Music Hall Sunday...

Sun-Times Media LLC All Rights Reserved. Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Movie Reviews 02/18/2016 1100pm Risen Biblical semi-epic turns silly at times grisly at others Richard Roeper richardroeper | email Give the Sony Pictures-backed Affirm Films and ""Risen"" director and co-writer Kevin Reynolds credit for making a different kind of Biblical semi-epic. Jesus Christ called by his Hebrew name of Yeshua in the film is played (and played quite well) by Cliff Curtis an actor of New Zealand Maori descent whose dark features more closely resemble what many historians claim Jesus would look like -- as opposed to the light-haired blue-eyed Jesus characters from old movies. (See Jeffrey Hunter ""King of Kings."") The disciples along with the Jewish high priest Caiaphas are also played by actors who look authentic to the heritage of the characters and the geography of the period. ""Risen"" focuses on chapters in the New Testament rarely explored at great length in fictional drama the immediate aftermath of the crucifixion from the time Jesus was taken from the cross and entombed to his resurrection and his appearances before the apostles before his ascension. Biblical scholars will do an infinitely better job than I of telling you exactly how faithful ""Risen"" is to the Scriptures. I do know that on more than a few occasions what we see onscreen is an almost literal translation of events as described in the Bible and told in churches. Alas ""Risen"" is told mostly from the point of view of Clavius (a bulked-up Joseph Fiennes covered with sweat and blood most of the movie like a light-heavyweight version of Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator"") an original character with no Biblical origins I can unearth. Clavius is a Roman military tribune -- a mighty warrior and the right hand of Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) who is already scheming and plotting his next political moves just hours after he ordered the execution of Jesus Christ. When the body of Jesus disappears from the tomb Pilate assigns Clavius to the case as if were in a 33 A.D. edition of ""Law and Order."" Clavius questions the bumbling idiot guards who got drunk and fell asleep; bursts into a house of ill repute and nabs Mary Magdalene (Maria Botto) who may hold the key to the case and questions the disciple Bartholomew (Stephen Hagan) who according to this movie was basically a New Testament version of Spicoli -- all white teeth and surfer hair and wide-eyed giggling. As Bart tells Clavius until recently it was just him and a handful of other hardcore followers of Jesus -- but now that Christ has risen and I quote ""This changes everything"" This isnt the only time ""Risen"" produces unintentional laughs. After Jesus appears to the disciples and then suddenly vanishes Simon Peter is asked what happened to Jesus. ""How should I know"" he bellows. Other times ""Risen"" is downright grisly. With the body of Jesus missing Clavius orders an inspection of all recently buried Jewish men -- and we get a number of gruesome close-ups of decomposing corpses while Clavius men gag and ward off swarms of flies. (Even with scenes of Roman soldiers breaking the legs of crucified men; blood spilled on the battlefield; and dozens of men suffering violent deaths ""Risen"" still gets a PG-13 rating. At least the MPAA is consistent in its ridiculous embrace of violence over sex and language.) Fiennes sticks with the brooding stoic performance even when Clavius is undergoing some major changes. Its not his best work. Peter Firth has a fine time playing the odious Pilate who cares only about saving his own hide. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy in the ""Potter"" movies) does fine work as Lucious the loyal apprentice to Clavius. In the last act ""Risen"" turns into a chase movie with the Roman soldiers in hot pursuit of Clavius and the disciples.  Do we really need to see Simon Peter et al. covering their tracks and finding a secret passageway to avoid the posse as if theyre in a mediocre Western? [s3r star=2/4] Columbia Pictures presents a film directed by Kevin Reynolds and written by Reynolds and Paul Aiello. Running time 108 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for biblical violence including some disturbing images).

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Refreshingly unpretentious Risen reimagines the Gospel as an ancient Roman cop movie in which a seen-it-all military tribune and his rookie second-in-command have to track down the missing body of a recently crucified Jewish preacher. Shot in stolid widescreen with every scene staged against a limestone wall or rock formation Risen skates by for a time as a no-frills budget-conscious genre piece tailing Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) and Lucius (Tom Felton) as they knock on doors interrogate Jews in potato-sack robes and badger the occasional hippie Apostle at the bidding of limp-wristed Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth). Unquestionably sincere the movie eschews the glowing blond Jesus of kitsch in favor of a brown-skinned Yeshua who hugs lepers and avoids giving Clavius a cowering ""big speech"" conversion. (In other words this isnt a real-life version of the film-within-a-film from Hail Caesar though it looks like it at times.) But just as the Roman starts to find himself in the thing that will eventually be called Christianity the movie begins to hobble shedding its eccentricities in favor of a less-than-inspired re-telling of the Gospel Of John. Produced under Sonys ""faith based"" Affirm Films banner Risen stands apart from its evangelical-targeted brethren by being an actual movie with some kind of values instead of a grab-bag of wishes in which Jesus name is sprinkled like fairy dust. (In fact no one says ""Jesus"" here or mentions heaven.) Best known for the notoriously expensive Waterworld director and co-writer Kevin Reynolds is an old hand at sword-and-cloak flicks (Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves The Count Of Monte Cristo); in a funny way the story of the Resurrection fits all of his pet motifs including sailboats (in a handsome Sea Of Galilee sequence) aristocratic bad guys (the movies decidedly non-conflicted version of Pilate) and plots that hinge on birthright secret identity and messianic destiny. Once the epitome of Hollywood bloat Reynolds aesthetic seems measured and classic compared to todays cut- and close-up-heavy norms. He frames mostly from the waist up and uses every opportunity he can to add in beams of light passing through lattices--the defining obsession of a generation of filmmakers who entered the industry wanting to be Ridley Scott.Risen has low-wattage charm as long as its working the supernatural mystery angle helped by the fact that it has just enough of a sense of humor about itself; when Clavius needs someone to identify Mary Magdalene he plucks a random soldier from the Roman barracks. But the very thing that defines the movies comparatively mature take on belief--the relationship between Clavius and the resurrected Yeshua (Cliff Curtis who has spent much of his career playing every ethnicity except Maori)--robs the movie of driving force. Given the state of the evangelical sub-industry Risen feels like a welcome alternative in that it feels like it was made by people who pray for something other than miracle cures and box office returns. But faith will only get you so far. Though its bolstered by some likable supporting performances (including Curtis feel-good messiah and Stewart Scudamores tetchy Peter) the film ends up falling into a loop of abortive climaxes set against an indistinguishable beige-gray backdrop of limestone before the inevitable cheap-looking flash of CGI light in a scraggly field.

"Risen treats crucifixion story as a police drama review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRisen treats crucifixion story as a police drama reviewRisen is a Bible parable told in the form of a modern police procedural concerning the quest for the body of the crucified Jesus Christ.Joseph Fiennes is Clavius in the newest crucifixion telling Risen.  (Columbia Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 18 2016RisenStarring Joseph Fiennes Peter Firth Tom Felton Cliff Curtis and Maria Botto. Directed by Kevin Reynolds. Opens Feb. 19 at GTA theatres. 107 minutes. 14ARisen is a Bible parable told in the form of a modern police procedural.Set in the Judea of A.D. 33 this story of faith resurrection and redemption concerns the hunt for the missing body of the crucified Jesus Christ. Its intended primarily for an audience of Christian believers but genuine drama precedes the preaching.Article Continued BelowJoseph Fiennes is appropriately just-the-facts as Clavius a brutally efficient Roman military tribune who acts as right-hand man to Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) the politically shrewd prefect (governor) of this Roman province.When Pilate needs a problem solved he turns to Clavius. And he has a big one in the continuing social unrest over the crucifixion of Christ a.k.a. Yeshua an upstart Nazarene whose still-breathing body hangs from the cross at Calvary. A growing number of people continue to proclaim Christ as the Messiah even after Clavius intervenes to make sure hes well and truly dead in a scene where the torment and tragedy are brought graphically home by director/co-writer Kevin Reynolds who spares no tender sensibilities.Clavius figures his work is done -- he longs for a ""day of peace"" -- but then Christs tomb is discovered empty three days later with rumours spreading that the Messiah has risen from the dead.This doesnt sit at all well with Pilate who is under pressure from Jewish elders to rid Jerusalem of Christ and his disciples whom they fear may lead a revolution. Worse still is the imminent arrival of Emperor Caesar from Rome who expects order and good government not disorder and rebellion. Clavius is tasked with finding Christs body along with a rookie sidekick named Lucius (Tom Felton) who threatens to make Risen suddenly turn into an extremely early Training Day prequel.Fortunately Fiennes is the battle-hardened anchor for a solid drama that resembles any number of film and TV crime stories.The Roman rousts Christs disciples interrogates repentant sinner Mary Magdalene (Maria Botto one of the few female cast members) and generally acts like the heavy cop he is all while attempting to resist the growing feeling that Christ and his teachings may offer the truth hes been seeking.And its thoroughly involving at least until it turns back into a boilerplate Bible tale.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The man in question is named Clavius (Joseph Fiennes). Hes dirty and haggard wandering around the ancient Judean desert until he comes upon a lonely inn. The innkeeper recognizes the Clavius ring as that of a Roman tribune. So what exactly brought a high-ranking member of the imperial Roman bureaucracy to the middle of nowhere? The short answer is Jesus (here known as Yeshua the original Hebrew version of his name). Upon returning to Jerusalem after some battles with Jewish insurgents Clavius is instructed by Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) to oversee the last hours of a crucifixion. So begins a sort of Rosencrantz amp; Guildenstern Are Dead riff--the aftermath of the Passion as seen by people who dont know whats going on. Clavius and his aide Lucius (Tom Felton) are hit by a firmament-tearing earthquake on their way to Golgotha for instance but dont think much of it. When they arrive at the execution site Clavius is the one who orders Yeshua (Cliff Curtis) to be stabbed in the side with a spear. Later he is instructed by Pilate to seal the tomb to prevent Yeshuas followers from stealing his body and claiming resurrection. Despite their best efforts of course the tomb is broken anyway and Yeshuas body vanishes. Clavius thus embarks on a bit of a CSI Ancient Jerusalem investigation examining the crime scene and interviewing witnesses to figure out whats going on. Despite Clavius best attempts at a logical explanation his search eventually leads him to a risen Yeshua and he must learn to reconcile the contradictory things he has seen. Those interesting story forms are then discarded in service of a fly-on-the-wall situation. Aside from one significant life-saving action Clavius does little but observe Yeshuas disciples on their journey to follow their risen leader. Risen is more entertaining than Bible-adjacent stories are usually allowed to be. The action sequences such as Clavius opening battle with Jewish rebels are visceral on a near-Game of Thrones level. Soldiers get stabbed in the crotch and everyones covered in dirt. The movie is also surprisingly funny. Pilates exasperation at pushy Jewish high priests Lucius struggle to adapt to dirty work and Clavius prickly relationship with Simon Peter (Stewart Scudamore) all throw dashes of levity into the serious proceedings. Ultimately however the movie fails to answer its own central question. Its unclear whether Clavius quit his prestigious position because of the crazy supernatural events he witnessed or because he was legitimately moved by Yeshuas message of forgiveness and peace. And what was the use of following this guys journey anyway if he just ended up in the desert after all? B- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Whether or not it triggers a craze for divinely inspired detective stories ""Risen"" makes a decent case for itself as the ""Columbo"" of the genre Its amiable creaky and not remotely predicated on the element of surprise. Set in the days after the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ this pleasantly plodding New Testament noir follows a Roman soldier who under orders from Pontius Pilate sets out to solve the mystery of the missing Messiah -- only to realize long after most viewers will that he is in fact playing a key role in the Greatest Story Ever Retold. By dint of its unusual time frame and perspective Kevin Reynolds film adopts a lighter more playful tone than most Hollywood biblical epics largely steering clear of heavy-handed dramatics and kitschy pageantry as it tells a slow-moving story of spiritual awakening. Still Sonys pre-Easter release is unlikely to ascend to the upper echelons of faith-based cinema culturally or commercially. Though this is Reynolds first film in a decade the director of ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" (and the ripe-for-rediscovery 1995 flop ""Waterworld"") still knows his way around a period piece and here he achieves a modest throwback to the grand studio Sunday-school lessons of yesteryear. In line with that tradition most of the prominent roles in this English-language production are played by white British actors though perhaps in the wake of the widely criticized ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" some effort has clearly been made to diversify. To that end the ensemble includes several Spanish performers including Maria Botto as Mary Magdalene Antonio Gil as Joseph of Arimathea and Paco Manzanedo as a Roman centurion. And in the boldest stroke of casting Jesus or Yeshua is played by the New Zealand-born Maori actor Cliff Curtis (a veteran of Reynolds ""Rapa Nui"") making for a darker-skinned and probably more accurate-looking version of the Christ than weve typically seen on screen. In the beginning (around A.D. 33) there is a clumsily shot and edited action sequence in which Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) a high-ranking tribune in the Roman military calmly slaughters a hostile Jewish fighter named Barabbas. Presumably this is the same Barabbas whose release from prison the Jews recently called for while condemning Yeshua which just goes to show that God and ahistorically minded screenwriters work in mysterious ways. Arriving in Jerusalem during Passover (nicely re-created on a budget by production designer Stefano Maria Ortolani) Clavius learns that the ever-weary Pilate (Peter Firth) having just ordered Yeshuas execution so as to placate the Jews still has a mini-crisis on his hands. A highly intelligent and resourceful leader as well as a skilled soldier Clavius is tasked with overseeing the removal of Yeshuas body leading to a sequence at Golgotha that offers viewers a slightly morbid primer on post-crucifixion disposal methods. The scene also gives us a brief solemn glimpse of Yeshua hanging on the cross plus the key detail that he died after several hours -- somewhat unusual since it often takes days to expire. (Could the timing of his death have had something to do with the earthquake that we saw tearing a CGI gash through a building minutes earlier? Verily.) With the body entrusted to the Arimatheans care Clavius thinks hes done with Yeshua for good -- but no. In an amusing running gag Pilate summons Clavius again and again each time with slightly greater urgency to take care of a situation that keeps finding new ways to spiral out of control. The calculating Jewish leader Caiaphas (Stephen Greif) is convinced that Yeshuas disciples will try to steal the body and claim his resurrection and so Clavius goes to secure the tomb with thick ropes and a Roman seal. But no matter Three days after the crucifixion the seal is broken the stone rolled aside and the body nowhere to be found prompting a severe interrogation of the centurions who were guarding the tomb. Desperate to find the corpse -- or at least a passable replacement -- before unrest breaks out Clavius and his younger aide Lucius (Tom Felton) begin an extended inquiry into Yeshuas life. They speak with many who testify to his love compassion and disinterest in political revolt including an old blind woman named Miriam (a striking Margaret Jackman) and the apostle Bartholomew (Stephen Hagan) whose laid-back surfer affect briefly threatens to turn the movie into ""Dude Wheres My Christ?"" Which isnt such a bad thing With the torments of Good Friday a thing of the past ""Risen"" is free to marble the investigative proceedings with welcome flashes of humor -- not all of it intentional as in an aborted chase scene that suggests Mary Magdalene may have had the makings of the worlds first parkour artist. A lame slut-shaming gag proves far less amusing and its unclear whether the film is mocking or indulging anti-Semitic attitudes when Pilate makes a snide remark about ""Caiaphas and his pack of raving Jews."" These instances of questionable levity aside however the otherwise literate script by Reynolds and Paul Aiello (who is credited with the story) gives Clavius a playful patrician wit that dovetails nicely with his skepticism ""A marvelous recruiting tool"" he mutters sarcastically when Bartholomew waxes poetic about Yeshuas promise of eternal life. Its a shrewd line allowing our antihero to speak for the atheists and agonistics in the audience and Fiennes never loses sight of Clavius steely intelligence even as he brings out subtler dimensions of compassion and self-doubt. (Felton is just OK as the mans inexperienced aide though ""Harry Potter"" fans can amuse themselves by picturing him as Draco Malfoy tagging along with Voldemorts little brother.) Its no spoiler to reveal that Clavius will eventually shed his cynicism and experience his own major spiritual epiphany a Damascene moment avant la lettre. (Fiennes is basically playing a serious version of George Clooneys Roman character in ""Hail Caesar"") From there the film moves into its climactic passage by the Sea of Galilee (handsomely lensed on the white-sand beaches of Spains Almeria province) where Yeshua rejoins his 11 disciples -- none of whom are particularly well individuated on screen with the boisterous exception of Stewart Scudamore as Peter. Clavius will soon be unofficially welcomed into their ranks and his transformation is clearly designed to encourage the viewer toward a similar posture of soul searching and acceptance. Yet believers and nonbelievers alike may well feel that the mystery has been dispelled too quickly and in a way that devalues the very faith that is the movies ostensible foundation. An encounter with Yeshua in the flesh cant help but lend ""Risen"" a gentle swell of feeling but even through this critics God-fearing eyes its a reminder that in the movies at least seeing is a lot easier than believing.

Lou says July 10 2016 at 345 pm As a 76 year old graphic artist/ Illustrator and a lover of my part of Anglican/catholic Christianity I choose my faith-based films after reading reviews from ALLl sides of the spectrum of religious to religious-intolerant views coupled with the Trailers that go with the film. I was so proud of this production and glad that I was by myself with my own Bluray disc being bathed in cinematic widescreen surround sound awe because I was swept away with crying that I would not have wanted ANYONE to witness sitting next to my macho self in RISENs first run which I avoided.... being convinced that it was going to be a MUST SEE for me and that would HAVE TO BE in my own home entertainment chair I could not imagine seeing so many movies as a professional reviewer has to as it would dull my like for most..much like the reviewer here Mr Chang. He seems to have dulled his need for beautiful cinema because it has become a plodding job... not entertainment anymore Reply Clem says July 5 2016 at 351 pm Not sure getting borked by God can be considered humble - that Mary gave birth in a manger then thought her son had gone mad when he was nailed to a cross? did she forget the immaculate conception thing? Reply Eric says June 27 2016 at 351 pm RISEN does a great job at dispelling the myth that Saul/Paul of Tarsus was an apostle of Jesus Christ. After taking part in the death of Bar-abbas (Son of the Father) and the crucifixion/death of Jesus Bar-Jonah (Son of Holy Spirit/Dove) A Roman Tribune investigates the disappearance of the Jewish Messiah from the tomb of Joseph (earthly Father of Jesus turned rich man of Arimathea turned Apostle candidate to replace Judas - all 3 persons of the Father of Jesus are ""just"" men the last even called ""Joseph Justus""). Tribune eventually meets up with the RISEN Jesus face-to-face and even witnesses Jesus perform a couple/few miracles. But after the Ascension of Yeshua (witnessed by Tribune) the Apostle Peter Bar-Jonah (Son of the Holy Spirit/Dove) the Rock/Cephas upon whom Jesus would build his church asks Tribune to join the Disciples/Apostles as ""Fishers of Men"" i.e. ""Kippers/Purifiers of Men"". But was Tribune going to be his ""Brothers Kipper""? Apparantly not. Tribune goes his separate way. We dont even have reason to believe that Tribune will keep his vow to the Jewish God Yahweh and initiate games in Yahwehs honor for handing over the Disciples to Tribune. So how in the world are we supposed to believe that Saul/Paul of Tarsus who never met Jesus in the flesh did not witness the crucifixion nor resurrection nor ascension nor the miracles of Jesus how are we to believe that Saul/Paul (a type of Tribune) could become leader of the Christian religion and its doctrine and church completely dominating the direction of the faith? Kidnapping it in some respects from the True Apostles? Keep in mind that Saul/Paul was a Benjamite Pharisee. What was warned of these ravenous wolves in sheeps clothing and their yeast/false teaching with regards to Jesus flock? Ill leave it at that. Reply Ultram Casuale says June 4 2016 at 405 am Pretty good movie. I appreciated the better than average accuracy of the sets and the understated presentation by the director and the actors. It was just any other brutal human day until this savior guy shows up and recommends we not kill each other. Which is just absurd. Reply David says June 2 2016 at 1138 pm The movie Risen makes the Roman soldiers out to be nice people. The Sinaiticus Bible which is the oldest bible there is clearly ends in Mark 168 and ends with Jesus surviving the crucifixion in March of 33AD. The Vatican then added many extra verses to the end of Mark about Jesus rising to heaven 40 days after the crucifixion which is 100% a lie.The entire modern Christian faith is based on these end of Mark scriptures. There never was a Jesus of Nazareth who was a carpenter as there was no Nazareth until 3000 years after his death. There was a Jesus the Nazorean Tek-tone metal merchant of Nazara and monastic writings show he lived a long time in Somerset England. He died in 73AD in Aude France. The movie Risen is based on 100% fiction as Jesus-Mithra goes into the sun at the Sea of Galilee taken from John 2111-153 fish Stonehenge was constructed using the triangular number 153 as is the 6000 year old Dog Head( Rev.2215) where the bible legally ends at Last Mountain Lake Sask.which is the Stairway to Heaven and is also in King Davids Psalm 104 map and manifold code. Jesus wrote many parts of the New Testament in later life. Acts 2519 shows he was alive in 61 AD. Reply Sonny Ng says April 30 2016 at 1217 pm Yes the dark skinned Yeshua was historically archeologically and biblically accurate in contrast to the blond hair blue eyed Hollywood white washing on screen incarnations of the past which evolved from medieval times as Christianity becomes more prominent and established in the West rather than the Middle East where Jesus originates and most natives at the time are Semitic or Arab in ethnic appearance and culture (despite some strong modern day racist undercurrents of linking Arabs with terrorists and Islam). Israelis today if you ask them are an extremely diverse people of many races and ethnic comprises primarily of diaspora Jews (with European Jews being the largest group) who immigrated in waves after the founding of modern Jewish state after WW2. Until the Romans adopted early Christianity (which led by Peter was still considered an insignificantJewish sect offshoot that retains many Hebrew traditions and whose worshippers still observe the Sabbath) as a state religion and spread it far and wide (by Paul principally as he translated it from Hebrew to Greek so as to facilitate the Gospels among the Gentiles. So with the exception of the Romans the vast majority of the Empires subjects in the East circa 33 AD were of a darker complexion ethically from ancient Antioch Jerusalem and later on Constantinople (present day Istanbul predating Islam). Take some serious early Christian comparative scholar courses (um not Sunday bible study) to educate yourself and rid ones ignorance of biblical stereotypings perpetuated by Western media and in particular Hollywood. For instance the movies gross biblical conflation of depicting Mary Madeleine as a repentant prostitute (started by Gregory the Great in the 6th Century as a model for sinners and theologians over the centuries who want to play down her importance as the ""apostle to the apostles"" in the patriarchal medieval world). Even the Vatican has corrected this apparent misrepresentation. Now if you said God creates himself in our image and therefore can be portrayed as blond hair blue eyed then that would be plausible) Reply Florcy says March 21 2016 at 656 pm By ""agonistics"" Im sure your meant agnostics. Reply Brian Ford says March 11 2016 at 524 pm The descendants of Isaac amp; Jacob were Caucasian. The descendants of Ishmael must have mingled with the descendants of Canaan which were black resulting in a somewhat darker skin. Arabs are darker skinned Israelites are white. So having a Maori actor portray Jesus is NOT more historically accurate. Death by crucfixion is a slow suffocation. That is why they normally broke the legs of their victims in order to hasten death. Prophecies about Jesus foretold that not a bone of his body would be broken so the guards wound up piercing his side with a spear. But it was ultimately Heavenly Father who ended it for Jesus when Jesus asked why the Father had forsaken Him and left Him to hang longer and not die as was needed. Jesus acknowledged what the Father was telling Him that He would take Him now as He proclaimed that he reinquished his spirit to His Father of His own will. Reply Sonny Ng says April 30 2016 at 1237 pm As hard as it is to grasp the idea but Yehsua like all the locals of Judeah depicted in Risen were primarily of Semitic ethnic origins despite the decades of Hollywood Eurocentricism to the contrary. Sorry but with the exception of the Romans all of the locals__Jesus the Disciples and followers Pharisees__were Mideast Arab looking dark complexities people in the historical and archeological contexts of the time. Most Protestant Catholics and Orthodox bible scholars would concur. That said what Jesus looks like is not important as his message and salvation. I am just pointing out Hollywood stereotyping tendencies. The biblical epics of the past though colorfully gorgeous and grand in pageantry were also simplistic ethnocentric (no surprise here per the vast audience catered) romanticized compared to the gritty and realistic recent blockbusters like the Passion. See my review. Reply jim says April 2 2016 at 602 pm ""The descendants of Isaac amp; Jacob were Caucasian"" What? No. Reply robbie says March 21 2016 at 149 pm so the descendants of Isaac and Jacob originated from the Caucasus mountains? Really? Reply ROB says February 25 2016 at 430 pm Seeing is easier than believing So true The great spoiler for me was that Clavius saw Jesus. The New Testament upholds that only the believers saw Jesus. The later converts had to trust the witness of the believers. I would have had Thomas as the doubter turned witness and Clavius interact with Thomas to be challenged about the veracity of the resurrection. This would rightly leave ""faith"" as central and not ""oh yea its all happening right in front of my eyes"". Reply Joanne says February 26 2016 at 438 pm No Rob the New Testament clearly points that Jesus appeared to unbelievers as well. Look at Saul of Tarsus or even Jeusu own brother James. Both saw Jesus AFTER the resurrection and were unbelievers until they saw him. Reply Patrick says February 25 2016 at 857 am JUSTIN - Correction re ""production designer"" - Chris Cornwell was not the PD. It was ""Stefano Maria Ortolani"". Reply Still Crazy says February 22 2016 at 200 pm I think its an xcellent review Im sure the films not perfect-what is? Im very excited to see it. Reply Willy T Ribbs says February 21 2016 at 259 pm Its a movie. I am a devout Christian amp; I recognize its just a movie. The Life of Brian was also just a movie. Your faith should not come from Hollywood it should come from within. I do intend to see this movie as it looks like a well done movies. Reply Dean Jackson says February 19 2016 at 1115 am THE DEFT POLITICAL MANEUVERINGS OF JESUS AND JEWISH OFFICIALS UNDER A PRECARIOUS ROMAN SHADOW The existence of a Roman occupation throughout the Levant circa 30 AD precluded Jewish authorities in Judea and Galilee-Perea openly accepting Jesus as the Messiah. If Jesus was realized to be the Messiah the Jewish authorities in Judea and Galilee would have played a game of feigned hostility towards Jesus thereby placating an always watchful Rome that dealt swiftly with even perceived threats to Roman rule. We see then that the Gospels narrative of Jewish officialdom hostility towards Jesus ministry is behavior one would expect from those officials. Is there then within the Gospels themselves evidence of Jewish officialdoms acceptance and knowledge of Jesus claim to the Messiah? In fact theres direct evidence. When Jesus was in Jerusalem on His first mission there early in His ministry period the Pharisee named Nicodemus paid Jesus a discreet visit at night informing Jesus that the Temple leaders knew Jesus was sent from God. Nicodemus admits ""Rabbi we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with Him.""

Reply Kathy says February 19 2016 at 838 am Its interesting that you were upset about the ""slut-shaming"" incident. As a woman I was extremely encouraged by how they portrayed Mary Magdalenes leadership among the disciples - how they listened to her about going to Galilee. Reply elizabethellencarter says February 20 2016 at 923 pm Im with you Kathy. I thought the scene in the barracks was amusing and Mary Magdalenes character a strong resourceful one. Reply 160by2 login says February 19 2016 at 539 am Well for a religious film nowadays ""could be worse"" is high praise. I do think ""Cop movie about Jesus resurrection"" is a pretty clever idea but Im struggling to think of anywhere dramatically appealing the story could go. Well dramatically appealing and not comically blasphemous. Reply Don says February 18 2016 at 914 pm The name BARABAS was common in Bible days and Scripture does refer to another man by that name who was executed for his political rebellion. I find that the movie is not inaccurate in this.

Photo Columbia Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Risen Running time 108 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence decomposing corpses). A.D. 2016 is a late date to be adding new characters to the Christ story. ""Risen"" veers so far off the Bibles path that it might as well be a tale of this 13th apostle called Marty who was in charge of snacks and mini-golf reservations. ""Shakespeare in Love"" star Joseph Fiennes a man in need of a career resurrection plays a battle-hardened Roman soldier who is first sent to finish off Christ (hes the guy who orders the spear to the side) then to play lead detective in a kind of ""CSI Judea."" Pilate (Peter Firth) orders him to find the dead body of Yeshua as Jesus is known to forestall any Messiah-based uprising among the Jews. But er what if Yeshua isnt quite dead? The movie co-written and directed by Kevin Reynolds that 1990s relic who directed ""Waterworld"" is a low-IQ affair that supposes that the Gospels will sound more convincing if seen through the eyes of a skeptic. Instead it seeks to improve the New Testament by putting a layer of Naugahyde upholstery on it. Fiennes Clavius sets out to do some Rome-splaining to the Jews making it clear to them that any balderdash about the Messiah returning to life will be treated harshly. He spends a dull stretch of the film visiting Jewish cemeteries trying to find a body he can pass off as Yeshuas (put a stab wound in the rib cage of a fly-eaten stiff and who will be the wiser?) then tracking down disciples and grilling them about the disappearance of Yeshuas body. Clavius a man with an admirably flexible mind finally finds Yeshua hanging out with friends and has second thoughts about Pilates idea to ""kill him again."" Figuring this is an unwise strategy considering how comprehensively the Nazarene was killed the first time he instead becomes a literal follower setting out with the disciples on a trip to the Sea of Galilee witnessing the curing of a leper and sending away his assistant (Tom Felton still doing his slimy Draco Malfoy thing). Is not Clavius committing treason to Rome? Doesnt he fear catching a sword to the neck for not only failing in his mission but joining Team J.C.? Does not a man raised in a mystical pagan culture suspect trickery or magic? And why would such an interesting mascot not have played a prominent role in the Gospels? I say unto you ask not the ways of screenwriters who seeketh only to maketh a buck from the suckers. Bad movies work in mysterious ways.

Fiennes is Clavius a Roman centurion assigned to keeping the peace in Jerusalem but the peace he really wants is that of ""a day without death"" preferably in a country villa. Roman procurator Pontius Pilate wants peace too which is why he assigns Clavius to guard the tomb of one Yeshua a recently crucified Jew who apparently told his followers he would rise from the dead. (If such a thing were even rumored to be true were told theres no telling what might happen. What were shown is that goofy laughing hippies will rise up and share their mystical message of love sharing and oh yes eternal life.) When the body goes missing Clavius sets out to solve the mystery. He examines the Shroud like its forensic evidence and conducts pointed interrogations of Yeshuas followers. Why its almost like an externalized search for the basis of faith Except its not -- not for long anyway. And once the question is answered all thats left is pious illustration plus maybe a silly chase through the desert. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

(Rosie Collins/Columbia Pictures) Timing is everything. ""Risen"" a dramatization of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus arrives in the throes of the Lenten season giving devout Christian filmgoers an early glimpse of the narrative theyll be revisiting in several weeks time. For those who worship at the altar of the Coen brothers ""Risen"" also arrives on the heels of ""Hail Caesar"" an affectionate sendup of the kind of schlocky self-important biblical epic that has made such a hash of the central and defining mystery of Christian belief. Cynics expecting the cheesy sanctimony and cheap sentiment that ""Hail Caesar"" lampoons can lay down their blow-darts. ""Risen"" turns out to be an intriguing if ultimately frustrating retelling of the familiar story here reconfigured as a detective procedural wherein a skeptical Roman military tribune is sent to investigate the disappearance of Jesuss body from the tomb. Directed with modest taste and relative restraint by Kevin Reynolds from a script by Paul Aiello this biblical thriller for the most part avoids the simplistic storytelling and amateurish production that have plagued so many Bible movies of yore. Conceived less as a textual reenactment than as a speculative reimagining ""Risen"" manages to imbue a slightly new perspective -- if not deep exegetical meaning -- into a story that has survived the interpretive liberties of Mel Gibson Martin Scorsese and Monty Python to name just a few. Rather than focus on the most familiar characters from those retellings ""Risen"" is the story of Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) a tough ambitious Roman soldier who when the story begins is serving as an enforcer for Judeas peevish imperial prefect Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth). Following Pilates order to prevent an uprising inspired by the torture and death of Jesus (played by Cliff Curtis and called Yeshua in the movie) Clavius embodies the classic qualities of an antihero bearing no ill will or even interest toward the martyred leader as a revolutionary force much less the Messiah. Claviuss interest is in maintaining order so that he might quickly return to Rome and continue to pursue wealth power and a comfortable old age. ""Risen"" follows the Biblical story of the resurrection. Clavius a powerful Roman military official and his aide Lucius are tasked with solving the mystery of what happened to Jesus in the weeks following the crucifixion. (Columbia Pictures) Fiennes -- best known at the moment as the white actor who will play Michael Jackson in the upcoming television special ""Elizabeth Michael and Marlon"" -- is quietly convincing as a cynical warrior who despite his studied disinterest is not entirely agnostic. He steals a prayer here and there to the Roman god Mars (while Pilate prays to Minerva for wisdom). Among the most effective scenes of ""Risen"" which was filmed in Spain and Malta are those in which Yeshuas terrified impoverished apostles huddle together in bewildered defeat unwittingly beginning to form a mighty world religion. For its first two-thirds ""Risen"" is animated by a provocative double helix of skepticism and spiritual faith the latter of which is embodied by Yeshuas followers a laid-back band that includes Mary Magdalene (Maria Botto) Simon (Joe Manjon) and a particularly blissed-out Bartholomew (Stephen Hagan). The movie only falters -- succumbing to moments of wince-inducing ham-handedness -- when its time to represent the resurrected Jesus and his reported miracles and when Reynolds opts for clumsy literalism that relegates profound mysteries to magic tricks. Rather than explore the most radical challenging substance of Jesuss ministry ""Risen"" is content to wow Clavius -- and the audience -- with what are staged as supernatural stunts. Viewers already well-versed in the greatest story ever told might find their interest piqued by the filmmakers unconventional take. Its unlikely however that ""Risen"" will preach to anyone outside the choir. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains biblical violence and some disturbing images. 107 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint I must faithfully report that I entered ""Risen"" not imagining that I would enjoy it. I have seen too many faith-based films whose makers believe that kitschy cliches are the road to salvation. Its my deeply held belief that there is less value in what a movie preaches than in how creatively it spreads its message. Yet enjoy it I did. What a good surprise it was to watch a biblical feature less preachy less stuffy and more entertaining than most. ""Risen"" is an original crime-fiction take on a story as old as stories get. The film avoids wide swaths of dogma to create a theological detective story. The sure-handed script is laced with gladiator-style battling a dash of biting humor and a pinch of sensibility. Its like a Raymond Chandler mystery but with a lot more swords. At the center of the story is a character never mentioned in Sunday school. He is Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) a centurion commanding troops at a relatively unimportant area in a small corner of the Roman Empire. Judaea in 33 A.D. is not the sort of assignment that ambitious soldiers strive for. Its a rebellious unpleasant territory and a source of endless bureaucratic headaches for Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) who has been the governor for almost a decade. The ever-irritable diplomat may be the only official even more weary of his post than Clavius. Pilates latest annoyance is a rising tide of new spiritual arrivals Christians whose Nazarene leader is said to be God incarnate. This development is inconvenient for the empire. People of various religious tribes have been killing heretics infidels pagans and nonbelievers since time immemorial and the Romans didnt want that sort of culture-war fuss to pop up again. So a traditional public crucifixion was the expedient political choice to control the difficult population. Then three days later the executed mans body vanished from its tomb without a trace. As his followers spread talk about him being the resurrected Messiah Clavius is assigned to probe the case find the body and hush all this superstition. As the irascible armor-clad detective Fiennes is impeccably low-key. Hes aloof but for an occasional ironic smirk when the Nazarenes followers share new beliefs that sound laughable to him. Once he sets out to solve the disappearance the film is largely focused on his emotional and spiritual development a gradual process of conversion Fiennes handles with a feather-light touch. RISEN  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for biblical violence including some disturbing images. Writer/director Kevin Reynolds (""The Count of Monte Cristo"") keeps the tone away from overbearing piety. Its actually fairly funny about sin and vanity. When Clavius asks his soldiers which one has spent time with that woman-of-the-streets Mary Magdalene quite a few raise their hands. When the disciple Peter (agreeably played by Stewart Scudamore) gets in a spat with Clavius boils over his humble and meek character and pours a flask of water he was about to offer Clavius on the desert sand its not just a solid joke. Its a bulls-eye representation of what he believes the hostile and ignorant Roman is doing with his own soul. Showing a shared enjoyment in both frivolity and seriousness ""Risen"" may be just what fans of the good book are looking for. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

He doesnt find it because as you may remember from Sunday school He is risen. (Rosie Collins/AP) BY Stephen Whitty NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday February 18 2016 717 AM Title Risen Film Info With Joseph Fiennes Tom Felton The Gospel according to Hollywood as a Roman investigates the Resurrection. Director Kevin Reynolds (147). PG-13 Gory violence alcohol abuse. Area theaters. In the beginning was the Word. But now if youre really going to reach people you got to have the Movie. That belief has created a world of ""faith-based"" films -- pious pictures that range from modern morality tales to classic Bible stories. In the latest ""Risen"" old Pontius Pilate hears that the corpse of a certain crucified prophet has been stolen -- and so he sends two of his men to investigate. Cue ""CSI Judea."" What happens of course is not what the stalwart soldier Clavius expects as he discovers not grave robbers but a thrilled group of 11 true believers. And soon finds something strange in himself A hunger to believe too. ""Risen"" is in the old tradition of The Good Pagan movie like ""The Robe"" or ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" (or the movie-within-a-movie spoof of ""Hail Caesar""). A Roman sinner is saved; a doubter accepts. Peter Firth (with Joseph Fiennes in the background) is too by-the-book as Pontius Pilate. (Rosie Collins/AP) It works fine for a while. Joseph Fiennes is properly imperious as Clavius and his ambitious assistant is well played by the weasel-y Tom Felton of the ""Harry Potter"" films. And director Kevin Reynolds is fully in charge -- but then again having directed a couple of Kevin Costner films he knows something about epics and people who act like God. Reynolds gets many things right the blasted look of the desert the dusty provincial look of a far-flung Roman outpost. And the story he tells is both serious and modest. But ""Risen"" offers no fresh slant on the Greatest Story Ever Told. In fact theres too much Old School approach here the Jews? Vengeful and duplicitous as ever (one even spits on Jesus dead body). Women? Jesus most-loyal followers are forgotten. Even the Virgin Mary is an extra. Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth)? Boring when he should have been campier. In the end you get a Sunday morning sermon when what you really want is a Saturday midnight screening.

EntertainmentMovies Risen an intriguing skillful take on story of Jesus Originally published February 18 2016 at 1201 am Updated February 17 2016 at 441 pm Clavius (Joseph Fiennes left) warns Lucius (Tom Felton) to let them all pass after Lucius discovers him leading the Apostles away from the Roman soldiers in Columbia Pictures ""Risen."" (Rosie Collins) Movie review of ""Risen"" With intelligence and great moviemaking skill filmmaker Kevin Reynolds has created an unconventional and compelling picture about the events surrounding the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus. Rating 3.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer Its one of the best-known stories in history the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus. Its been depicted in countless movies. Yet writer-director Kevin Reynolds has succeeded in presenting the event from an intriguing and unconventional perspective. In ""Risen"" Reynolds treats the great mystery of the Resurrection as a kind of police procedural in which a Roman tribune named Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) functions as a skeptical detective as he tries to unravel the mystery of how the body of the crucified Jesus (here called Yeshua) disappeared from the sealed tomb. Under orders from Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) he rounds up suspects Mary Magdalene (Maria Botto) among them and gives them the third degree. Confessions are extracted informants are bribed bodies are exhumed doors are kicked in by the Roman equivalent of a SWAT team. Movie Review 1/2   Risen Joseph Fiennes Tom Felton Peter Firth Cliff Curtis. Directed by Kevin Reynolds from a screenplay by Reynolds and Paul Aiello. 108 minutes. Rated PG-13 for biblical violence including some disturbing images. Several theaters. Clavius turns Jerusalem upside down and yet the mystery only deepens.

A soldier left to guard the tomb who drunkenly falls asleep on the job weeps as he tells of being awakened by a ""terrible flash"" and finding the tomb emptied. ""Explain it to me"" he begs Clavius. The investigators skepticism turns to bafflement and when he encounters the risen Yeshua (Cliff Curtis) bafflement turns to wonder. Reynolds whose previous pictures include ""Waterworld"" and ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" knows his way around epic productions but there is no grandiosity in his direction of ""Risen."" With its sun-seared desert landscapes (shot in Malta and Spain) his Judea has the rough look of a frontier where rebellious Jews battle Roman soldiers a place that has forged Clavius into a hard-bitten fighter. Fiennes is superb portraying a man slowly transformed by events that shake his beliefs about the world and his place in it to their core. Excellent also is Firth whose Pilate is a tough-minded ruler who perceives the threat that the disappearance of the body -- and the growing belief among Jerusalems subject people in a miraculous return from the dead -- poses to Roman control of Judea. Reynolds meshes his modern police-story perspective with traditional biblical elements from the depiction of Jesus on the cross to his appearance on the shores of the Sea of Galilee before the ecstatic Apostles in a way that is respectful while skillfully avoiding the kind of sanctimony or religiosity that too often characterizes biblical epics. With intelligence and great moviemaking skill he has created a classic variation on a venerated ancient theme.
