But it misses the mark completely coming off instead as creepy. Waiting for Forever Bomb to bad Director James Keach. Cast Rachel Bilson Tom Sturridge Richard Jenkins. Rating PG-13 for violent content brief strong language and thematic material. Guide to this weeks new releases Qamp;A with actress Blythe Danner Director James Keach misjudges devotion for some sort of stalker vibe making the whole thing an uncomfortable mess. Rachel Bilson does what she can in a thankless role as a TV star who is the object of obsession for not one but two guys and Richard Jenkins is his usual welcome presence. But otherwise... ugh. We first meet Will Donner (Tom Sturridge) as hes hitchhiking. Hes wearing a bowler pajamas and a vest which is movie code for lovable eccentric or seriously damaged person. Keach tries to convince us of the former but it doesnt take long to realize Will is the latter. He is heading back to his hometown in Pennsylvania because he knows that Emma Twist (Bilson) is going there too to visit her sick father (Jenkins) whos being cared for by her unfortunately dippy mother (Blythe Danner). Will initially describes Emma as his true love but acknowledges almost as an aside that he hasnt actually spoken to her in years. They grew up together but his parents were killed in a train wreck and he had to move away but not before she promised to always be there for him. Since then he has whiled away the time moving to wherever Emma lives as her career as a TV star blossoms. Had she known of his presence a restraining order would have been appropriate. Unfortunately for her (and us) she didnt. Once hes in town it takes Will some time to work up the courage to actually approach Emma which gives him a chance to visit friends (Nelson Franklin and Nikki Blonsky) and be berated by his banker brother (Scott Mechlowicz). His friends encourage him to live out his dream of blindly devoting his life to his quixotic pursuit of Emma. His brother tells him he should grow up get a job maybe buy some real clothes. In theory youd probably side with his brother but Mechlowicz makes him so off-putting you simply dont care. Will finally gets up the gumption to talk to Emma but - if you can imagine - it doesnt go as he planned. She is upset because 1) her father is dying and 2) her psycho boyfriend (Matthew Davis) also has shown up in town to ""forgive"" her for cheating on him despite the fact that he has done far worse. Thus a dumb story becomes with a ludicrous plot twist truly stupid. But dont worry theres time for it to get still more ridiculous. There is a place in the movie world for offbeat romances. Whenever something as clever and original as ""(500) Days of Summer"" comes along its embraced because so many romantic comedies or dramas are rote lifeless affairs. You cant say that about ""Waiting for Forever"" but it strains both credulity and patience in its attempt to be different and it leaves you feeling creeped out as well.

Everyone keeps telling the delicate dreamer Willie (a squinty Tom Sturridge clad in the hobo-dork style of a lesser member of Culture Club) that hes such a free spirit rebel and nonconformist that he has no chance with dream girl Emma (Rachel Bilson). She was his childhood pal until he was forced to move away from his Pennsylvania hometown when his parents were killed in a rail accident. Emma an actress who is home comforting her dying dad (Richard Jenkins whose gruff wit is the sole bright spot) has moved on and forgotten about Will. Shes got a snarly boyfriend but nobody (including her) likes him and he serves as no more than the semi-beef-like chemical filler in this insipid little taco of a movie. Hugs and tears and a mewling soundtrack fill the time with congealed emotion. These extravagantly bungled hopes-and-dreams discussions mingle with an even more appalling set of flashbacks filmed in glowy overexposures indicative of lost heaven. Also somebody should tell Sturridge that the manic-pixie-dreamgirl act really isnt very attractive in a dude.

"Movie review Waiting for Forever - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Waiting for ForeverThe reality-challenged film is an insipid contemporary fairy tale about a lovestruck young vagabondFebruary 04 2011|By Robert Abele At least when Peter Pan refused to grow up we got flying island peril heroism and pirates as part of the package. With ""Waiting for Forever"" an insipid contemporary fairy tale about a lovestruck young vagabond shadowing a childhood sweetheart he cant bring himself to approach we get stalking juggling and cancer. Happy Valentines Day Its rare to find a movie protagonist who singularly fails on every count to be a compelling sympathetic or even understandable figure but dopey street performer Will (Tom Sturridge) is one such character. If his twee bowler-hat/vest/checkered-pajamas get-up doesnt reel your eyes upward a and make you mourn for the term ""Chaplinesque"" a then his irritatingly moony behavior open-mouthed looks of infantile confusion and reality-challenged outlook should. The object of Wills affection a better yet affectation a is Emma (Rachel Bilson) the girl who when they were children helped him through the tragic death of his parents. Since losing touch with her though Will has tracked her to every city shes lived in a and now their hometown where most of the movie takes place. His operating principle is that a day in which he might see Emma is better than a day in which he knows hell never see her a sentiment one can only imagine screenwriter Steve Adams picked up from the depositions of convicted stalkers. That Emma is a melancholic TV actress with a canceled series whos back home to tend to her dying father (Richard Jenkins) and distraught mother (Blythe Danner) only makes Wills fantasy quest seem that much more tone-deaf. Whenever his fed-up brother (Scott Mechlowicz) shows up to burst Wills merry-misfit bubble with intimations of mental unhealthiness the effect is supposed to be true-love buzzkill. Instead hes like a voice of reason. Bilsons sense of nervous accommodation then dawning worry is spot-on when Will finally engages with Emma halfway through but she cant sell the inevitable as director James Keach haphazardly stumbles toward happy-ending-land. Sturridges task meanwhile is so impossible it will hopefully a for the sake of this gung-ho (and for all one knows perfectly talented) young mans career a warrant its own post-traumatic disconnect trying to forget it ever happened.

Joe Neumaier Thursday February 3 2011 537 PM Title Waiting for Forever With Rachel Bilson Tom Sturridge Richard Jenkins. Director James Keach. A street performer hopes to meet up with the girl he loved in his childhood.  (134). PG-13 Language. At the Empire 25.As a lovestruck street performer in ""Waiting for Forever"" Tom Sturridge seems to be suffering from the same incurable state of whimsy that afflicted Johnny Depp in ""Benny amp; Joon.""He walks around in a bowler hat wears pajamas all day hitches rides when hes not traveling on top of a train car ... yup everything clicks. Oh and hes a juggling flower-from-the-sleeve-pulling soft-spoken mime.If youre still reading then you wont be surprised to know that Willie the character Sturridge plays pines for a girl way beyond his station. (That station being Annoying Boy-Man with a Dewy Wounded Soul.) Willie and Emma (Rachel Bilson) were grade-school soul mates chastely yearning for each other until Willies parents died and he and his brother went to live with relatives in another state.Now adults -- if a bowler-wearing mime can be called that -- Willie hasnt seen Emma in over a decade. She has become a medium-famous TV star suffering through some vague lifes-not-fun ennui and a bad relationship with her abusive co-star who follows Emma to Pennsylvania where her father (Richard Jenkins) is dying. Willie swooning for Emma from afar without ever approaching her also heads east to be near her.Willie lives off the kindness of strangers and acquaintances though his older brother (Scott Mechlowicz) wants to slap him with a cold dose of reality about their parents talking to imaginary people and especially Emma who hasnt exactly been waiting for her dream mime to come. Viewers may just want to slap him.Director James Keachs movie is so annoyingly dipsy-doodle that TV veteran Bilson trying hard to look haunted and angsty is boxed in. Same goes for Jenkins and Blythe Danner as Emmas mom -- they seem to be in another movie as is Mechlowicz whose tough edge helps balance out Sturridges infantile poutings.Inevitably though no one emerges unscathed from the twee cutesiness.

Strangely unaware of its overt creepiness this unsettling puppy-dog romance from actor-turned-director James Keach (The Stars Fell on Henrietta) and writer Steve Adams (Envy) stars Rachel Bilson as the ingenue with Tom Sturridge as the free spirit (read homeless dude) who has pined for her since well forever. Dressed in a bowler hat and vest over pajamas Sturridges orphaned juggler is a miscalculated amalgam of quirky innocence--Johnny Depps vaudevillean flair from Benny amp; Joon paired with the pushover chivalry of Pretty in Pinks Duckie--who comes off as a punchably self-indulgent sponger who needs to grow a pair get a job and stop reminiscing about being a kid. When Bilson returns home to Anytown USA to be with her cancer-ridden father (Richard Jenkins) and daffy mother (Blythe Danner) You-Know-Who follows their non-relationship further complicated by the arrival of her bad-boy beau. Dreamy flashbacks third-act self-realizations and melodramatic plot devices ensue (Dads already dying so why not add an accidental murder?) with a nostalgic tone less heartfelt than Hipstamatics retro camera filters.

Daily Edition Login to download FILM REVIEW Rachel Bilsons Waiting for Forever Fails With an Implausible Generic Story 1251 PM PST 1/31/2011 by Sheri Linden FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS An ill-conceived romantic drama thats as sappy vague and awkward as its title. TWITTER British up-and-comer Tom Sturridge stars in a deeply conflicting drama directed by James Keach that barely features two-dimensional characters. Mistaking arrested development for enlightened innocence Waiting for Forever is an indigestible hash of whimsy drama romance and for good measure crime. Theres hardly a believable moment in this story of a childlike nonconformist and his sideways crab-crawl toward the love of his life. Beyond the tried-and-true ""follow your heart"" the takeaway from the misbegotten mush might be that jugglers are people too -- a cri de coeur not likely to drum up much anticipation after the film bows Friday. The emotionally wounded naif at the center of the story Will (Tom Sturridge) is a wandering street performer whos meant to be purer and more evolved than the ordinary toilers of the mundane ole material world. He dresses in pajamas and bowler speaks haltingly with a faraway glint in his eye and is unconcerned with career or possessions. In obvious contrast to all this gentle eccentricity is Wills brother Jim (Scott Mechlowicz) a banker -- what else -- who dares to question Wills mental health. Filmgoers will do likewise especially when it becomes clear that Will hasnt exactly been wandering aimlessly. Hes been tracking his childhood sweetheart around the country -- not following or stalking he assures her at one point but ""going where you are."" As the story opens Will is hitchhiking to his Pennsylvania hometown having learned that Emma (Rachel Bilson of The O.C.) is visiting her ailing father. The difficult realities awaiting the beloved-from-afar Emma now a TV star at least offer respite from an unfulfilling career and a mangled relationship with her jealous boyfriend (The Vampire Diaries Matthew Davis). As her desperately lighthearted mother and take-no-prisoners father Blythe Danner and Richard Jenkins offer a glimpse of another film one with grownups in it. Mechlowiczs Jim and Jaime King as his wife do what they can to inject some conflicted emotion into their roles. The rest of the supporting performances range from tolerable to cringe-inducing. The central love story is impossible to care about with Bilsons Emma barely two-dimensional. Brit Sturridge -- who will play Carlo Marx the Allen Ginsberg character in On the Road -- brings an apt fey quality to Will. But the supposed free spirit is a deeply problematic construction in the first place lacking the necessary depth to make his personality disorder (not Aspergers; hes a preternaturally gifted reader of other peoples moods) look like the special gift its meant to be. In lieu of well-developed characters and strong dialogue Steve Adams lards his screenplay with backstory that does little to make the present-day action less ludicrous. The story veers from one implausible situation to the next even taking a bizarre turn into policier territory for all of a minute with a bad-cop cameo by director James Keach. Behind the camera Keach opts at times for a fable-like tone with postcard-America visuals from DP Matthew Irving. Utah locations might not convince as small-town Pennsylvania but they offer a scrubbed and wholesome vision that suits the storys make-believe aspects. The proportions are all wrong though in the mix of flat-footed whimsy and unrealistic realism.

All the improbable oddball and endless love in the world cant rescue ""Waiting for Forever"" from a premise thats irresponsible at worst and an example of profoundly bad timing at best A young man with obvious mental problems is indulged by his friends ignored by his family never gets the help he needs and stalks his childhood sweetheart all over the country. As quasi-comedy ""Waiting"" does a pretty good impersonation of incipient tragedy -- especially in light of the recent events in Arizona which will likely color films reception and poison word of mouth. Pathos is an underrated quality but this melancholy romance helmed by James Keach (""Blind Dating"") and scripted by Steve Adams pushes it into uncharted territory. The problem isnt so much that Will Donner (Tom Sturridge) dresses in pajamas and a bowler hat or makes a living juggling on the street or gets around by hitchhiking (one of the films more implausible devices) or even that he wears a faraway unstable look that occasionally suggests Robert De Niro in ""Mean Streets."" He also talks to his parents in the middle of conversations with other people -- and as we learn through a series of gauzy and somewhat mawkish flashbacks Wills parents were killed in a train wreck when he was about 6 which is when his emotional development seized up like an unoiled engine. Will and his brother Jim (Scott Mechlowicz) moved away and he never saw his best friend Emma again -- except from the shadows as he followed her around. One of the more appalling aspects of the story -- if one were to actually buy into it -- is that Wills fixation on Emma is common knowledge among his friends and family and everyone else in their small Pennsylvania town and nobody has ever bothered to tell Emma. Meanwhile Emma (Rachel Bilson) has grown up to be an actress whose L.A.-based sitcom has just been canceled and whose relationship with her clearly volatile co-star Aaron (Matthew Davis) has hit the skids. So she heads home to her slightly dithery mother Miranda (Blythe Danner) and dying father Richard (a terrific Richard Jenkins). Unbeknownst to her shes followed by Will who somehow always knows her travel plans and for some reason or other is finally going to summon up the courage to knock on Emmas door just as the young womans life is falling apart. ""Waiting for Forever"" wants to be a fairy tale -- those flashbacks say it as does Wills occasionally winsome sprite-like persona. But even though he sort of gets better -- conveniently by the end of the film -- its clear from his earlier actions that hes truly demented He makes no cognitive connection with Jim when the latter asks for help he has no awareness that his behavior is strange and he doesnt process language properly (when a hysterical Emma accuses him of stalking her he repeatedly responds ""I go where you go""). The idea that his state of mind would be presented as anything but tragic and sad -- rather than say misunderstood by a world too callous to appreciate his sensitivity -- makes for a movie that eludes the viewers grasp because its arguing a position auds will find instinctively wrong. Performances are good given the context Bilson is solid and Jenkins flawless as a man who greets his impending demise like a character out of Beckett. Danner gives a delicate rendering via Mirandas incessant cheeriness of an older woman whose familiar world is collapsing. Sturridge for all the scripts problems has obviously worked at creating something novel out of Will even if that something is a behatted cherubic psychotic. You dont know if he might snap -- and the fact that a murder subplot is gracelessly shoehorned into the narrative merely points up the films chief flaw which is its attempt to pass off real mental illness as eccentricity. Production values are topnotch especially the recurrent theme by Nick Urata which is quite lovely and atmospheric.
