"Derivative College flunks comedy test - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-NudityMOVIE REVIEW Derivative College flunks comedy testSeptember 01 2008|Gary Goldstein | Special to The Times Take equal parts ""Superbad"" ""Animal House"" and ""Risky Business""; extract the wit charm and originality; mix in as much beer human excrement and upchuck as logistically possible; sprinkle liberally with nudity homophobia and sexism; and youll have the recipe for ""College"" a tedious by-the-numbers raunch-fest that exists strictly because it can.Directed by Deb Hagan from Dan Callahan and Adam Ellisons grab-bag script the movie also proves an unfortunate big-screen choice for appealing TV star Drake Bell (Nickelodeons ""Drake amp; Josh"") who plays Kevin a buttoned-up high-schooler who takes off for a wild college weekend to shed his nice-guy image.Along with his two outcast buds -- chunky loudmouth Carter (Andrew Caldwell) and nerdy Morris (Kevin Covais) -- Kevin winds up stuck in a hellish frat house whose merciless brothers led by callow stud Teague (Brad Pitt look-alike Nick Zano) conspire to make the naive trios pre-frosh visit one theyll never forget. And not in a good way.Some low-lights Kevin is forced to clean perhaps the grossest toilet bowl in movie history; Kevin and company land in a cartoonish gay frat party missing only the Village People; Verne Troyer urinates on some folks; and theres a lovely pig stampede. Enjoy.--""College."" MPAA rating R for pervasive crude and sexual content nudity language drug and alcohol abuse. Running time 1 hour 34 minutes. In general release.

"Movie Review College - 1 star out of 5 - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie Review College - 1 star out of 5 Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Josh Peck of TVs Drake amp; Josh left his kiddie TV show days behind him with the indie coming-of-age dramedy The Wackness this summer playing a pot dealer who finds love and sex over one magical summer before college. Drake Bell of TVs Drake amp; Josh -- he plays Drake ysee -- tries to go Josh one better or worse in College a raunchy comedy that plays like a Superbad without the smarts the heart the originality or the laughs.Oh to have a 16-year-old son or daughter just so I could tell them ""No way youre seeing that junk."" Kevin (Bell) is a high school senior heading off to his visitation weekend at Fieldmont University. His girlfriend has just dumped him for being boring. His bookish classmate Morris (Kevin Covais) wants to really go and tour the campus maybe land a scholarship. But slovenly party-hearty pal Carter (Andrew Caldwell) figures its time for Kevin to get his freak on.After rejecting the dorm room of a chronic masturbator as their home for the weekend they stay at a frat house where the Animal House cast-offs proceed to torment haze abuse and rob them in between beer busts and topless parties with all manner of compliant coeds. Naturally the high school lads hook up. If only they can stop being distracted by the beer pot and nitrous oxide abuse the endless shots of Penthouse centerfolds making out with one another (director Deb Hagan what are you trying to tell us hmmm?) maybe theyll find true love with older women.The explicit how-to manual on how to do ""body shots"" play quarters and assorted other chugging games is more irresponsible than amusing. It should be amusingly irresponsible. The lads juvenile homophobia isnt funny either.And Bell? Hes relegated to straight-man status trying to keep the peace between his nerd-cliche pal and his butt-gut Chris Farley-clone pal.""Enough you guys""Haley Bennett is the dull somewhat pretty girl who tickles Kevins fancy. She doesnt have anything funny to do either. Some nudity some revolting pranks some more revolting trips into the toilet and a script littered with f-bombs and then you see on his resume that Bell is still planning on doing a Drake amp; Josh Christmas special.Is their Nickelodeon audience old enough for College? Or did they mature right past it? If they have good parents they will.

Wednesday August 27 2008 at 4 a.m. By Nick Pinkerton Film critics never come home stinking of their honest labor but the nearest equivalent is covering something like College which leaves its stain on ones very humanity. Three high-school bros on a college visit--a dork a gelatinous loudmouth and a faintly sympathetic straight man with anime-character hair--run afoul of a frat marshaled by a smug Van Wilder/that-Sugar-Ray-guy amalgam who subjects the boys to Sadean hazing. (He also has the one funny line ""What the fuck do you know about welfare reform?"") And so begins a morally numbing gantlet run through mechanical decadence surpassing even the straight-to-DVD soul-gangbanging American Pie Presents The Naked Mile. ""Queef"" ""tossed salad"" Verne Troyer and the ol fist-pump open-mouth tongue-in-cheek blowjob pantomime are utilized just as though they were jokes (what kids--no ""donkey punch""?). The overall mood is limply obligatory as if everyone involved had been court-ordered to make a raunchfest party flick (director Deb Hagen only tunes in during her one tracking shot). One cant imagine theres an actual screenplay behind this--somebody seems to think Fatty is so good you can just let him riff. Nearly justifies traveling back in time to pre-emptively kill Edison Muybridge and the Lumiere brothers.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The schlock merchants responsible for College should be grateful that it opened on the same day as Disaster Movie. In any other week the risible teen sex romp would walk away with the prize for most pathetic excuse for a comedy. Yet insulting audiences with College and Disaster Movie on the same weekend threatens to split the lucrative undiscriminating dumb-ass demographic. A film that threatens to give gratuitous nudity profanity and rank stupidity a bad name College casts Drake Bell of Nickelodeons Drake amp; Josh (you can probably guess which one he plays) as an uptight high-school senior whose girlfriend dumps him for being boring. Eager to prove her wrong Bell heads to a local college for a Dionysian weekend alongside McLovin wannabe Kevin Covais (rapidly burning off the 15 minutes in the spotlight his turn on American Idol afforded him) and hard-partying fat slob Andrew Caldwell who appears to be the product of an experiment to clone Chris Farley gone horribly awry. The three wan stereotypes end up crashing at a disreputable fraternity house under the Stalin-like rule of suspiciously ancient actors who havent looked college-age since early in the Clinton era. College is powered by alternating currents of wish-fulfillment and mindless cruelty. So the hapless high-school dorks spend 10 percent of the film inexplicably getting laid 80 percent of the film getting humiliated and 10 percent enacting unlikely revenge on their geriatric tormentors. Its a joyless misfire determined to deliver the time-tested staples of the college comedy--pot-smoking binge drinking cruel pranks anonymous hook-ups authority-offending nonstop boobage--in the most perfunctory least satisfying manner imaginable. Its not an encouraging sign when the appearance of a urination-happy Verne Troyer--in his worst film of the summer no small feat considering the competition is Uwe Bolls Postal and Mike Meyers The Love Guru--classes up the proceedings considerably. First-time director Deb Hagan desperately wants her hard-R College to be Superbad. Instead its merely god-awful. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Babylon A.D.

Their latest cinematic temptation is yet another tiresome fraternities-are-wild offering in which three high school seniors take a weekend trip to a promising college campus and have like a totally insane time. With its rapid-fire bombardment of one gross-out moment after the next Deb Hagans ""College"" strains to sell itself as one crazy ride (raging parties hot lesbian sex bare breasts) and chances are it wont disappoint those looking solely for unadulterated raunch.Photographed with a soft slightly washed-out look better suited to a period piece the protagonists -- the overweight wisecracker (Andrew Caldwell) the pasty geek (Kevin Covais) and the sensitive bore (Drake Bell) -- are subjected to a series of humiliations at the hands of a particularly nasty fraternity before turning the tables lamely employing comparable tricks.

The movie is Animal House crossed with (warning Very frightening thought coming) an incredibly dumbed-down Superbad. You know how much times have changed when you meet the main fraternitys Bluto figure a paramilitary psycho named Bearcat (Gary Owen) whose most evolved activity is playing paintball sniper. Thats as innovative as the movie gets. Our heroes go to a girls-gone-mildly-wild drink-till-you-puke bash in which each one of them wastes no time hooking up with a babe (yeah right). The next night they go to another party this one with strippers and Verne Troyer (as himself). The dialogue runs to such witty observations as ""On a scale of one to 10 boobies are a 9000"" Friendly yet toothless College musters little energy even as anarchic-party-movie nostalgia. Maybe thats because in Animal House there was a real institution to rebel against -- it was called college -- whereas here the frat house has become the institution. The characters go through the rituals of hedonism humiliation and revenge as dutifully as if they were applying for their first corporate jobs.

"The jokes are as flat as the beer in College - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review The jokes are as flat as the beer in College From left Kevin Covais Andrew Caldwell and Drake Bell play high school seniors expecting a high time on a college visit. (MGM) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / August 30 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Its only right that the end of the summer movie season leaves crumbs at the megaplex. And setting a comedy at a frat house should make you slightly more tolerant of its looking like it was found between the cushions of a hand-me-down couch. But even by those standards ""College"" is wrong. The grime filth slop vomit and crotch-nibbling pigs double all too easily as a recipe for this movies failure. It hasnt been made so much as excreted. Things never get better than the movies poster which features a kid with his head in a toilet. Incidentally that image doubles concisely as apt film criticism.Most movies recall college for the keg stands body shots and barely suppressed homoeroticism and thats OK. But the memories here seem like another movies. Its another trio of party-faring high school seniors - one nervous and skinny (Drake Bell) one obnoxious and fat (Andrew Caldwell) one ultra-geeky (Kevin Covais) - and a series of embarrassments at the hands of frat boys. Why is none of it funny? Because weve already seen ""Superbad"" and ""College"" is less a remake than an amateur production of a bootleg copy of same - something youd find on a folding table near a bus stop.The sinking sense that college is a cesspool could have been some kind of amusing joke if the director Deb Hagan or the writers Dan Callahan and Adam Ellison knew how to tell a joke. The frat bullies big comeuppance might have felt good too. But even that is like having your face rubbed in somebodys armpit. I didnt care for the boys and their boilerplate social ambitions. I was worried for Caldwell though. He screams his lines until hes hoarse seemingly so desperate to capture that Jonah Hill feeling that he appears to be risking his health to do it. Really I felt worse for other stuff like the hundreds and hundreds of plastic party cups injured in the making of this movie.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Begrudging chuckles come via ultra-crude gags none yuckier than that of the ""pre-frosh"" trio doing unsanitary body shots off a furry jock called Bearcat. Sporting sideburns Nickelodeon alum Drake Bell earns pics few mellow moments as a cutie photographer who traipses from one barely delineated g.f. (Alona Tal) to another (Haley Bennett). Andrew Caldwell and former ""American Idol"" contestant Kevin Covais steal one or two scenes apiece as respectively the tubby slob who scarfs cereal straight from the box and the four-eyed wimp whose physical education is limited to lifting physics textbooks. Well-paced pic shot in New Orleans looks intermittently dark and splotchy. Music is embarrassingly out of date; opening credits are splayed on jerseys cig-strewn concrete a cell phone and yes pre-frosh flesh.
