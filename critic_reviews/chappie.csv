Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Katie Kilkenny Mar 6 2015 Culture Early on in its development things didnt look so good for Chappie and not just because of its horrendous title. The director Neill Blomkamps adventurous decision to hire the South African cult-hit rave duo Die Antwoord as actors didnt appear to be paying off Strife between the rappers and the cast and crew resulted in the groups frontman Ninja being written out of a scene a frustrated interview with a fellow cast member and reportedly an incident with Dev Patel and a space cake. The styles of the first two trailers were so diametrically opposed to one another that it was hard to tell whether the titular robots journey was supposed to be a heartwarming fable in the vein of Pinocchio or a brutal action-adventure a la Robocop. The fate of the robot though was the least of everyones worries when the spots highlighted a manically one-dimensional apparently technophobic Hugh Jackman sporting a mullet.Now that Chappie has been released it should be noted that all of these early fears have been realized. Hugh Jackman really does play a cardboard monster. Dev Patel actually acts and speaks like Die Antwoords Ninja fed him drugged sweets the entire production. And Ninja himself is so unlikeable that his entrance into nearly every scene is preceded by a disclaimer of his general unpleasantness by another character and a visible cringe from every sentient being in the frame. Jackmans mullet tinged with a mustard-gold color on top that is nowhere to be found in nature really is that horrific.Related Story Elysium Cant Stay Aloft But the ineptitude of the human performances in Chappie is by design. In Blomkamps latest the mortals and their particular quirks take a backseat to the titular robot who is the first according to the films eminently contemporary tale to possess consciousness. Charged with raising the precocious emotional robot like a child Chappies human guardians fail him every which way. But their repeated let-downs are only fitting for a story about the universal experience of growing up even for one that replaces flesh and bone with titanium and a fully active brain with a computer chip. Coming of age is messy painful and cartoonishly difficult--Chappies artistic choice to makes its humans caricatures only strengthens its argument for the transcendence of humanity all the way into cold steel.Like so many other classic stories about childhood and trauma--Matilda The Little Princess almost anything out of Charles Dickens--Chappie grows up in a harsh environment dominated by foster parents who are ill-suited to the responsibility of raising a child. In 2016 in Johannesburg a weapons manufacturer called Tetra Vaal Industries has successfully equipped the city with the worlds first all-robot police force. Newsreel footage shows that the world is generally content with this development Crime has plummeted and the titanium-clad robots ably shield human bodies from harm. Yet their creator an idealistic young engineer named Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) is eager to make his artificially-intelligent creations fully intelligent. He devises a program to instill consciousness in his robots and when his bottom line-fixated boss Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) forbids him from installing the software he secretly programs a damaged child-like droid.Chappie is more about the unjust rule of law in the household than on the streets.His grand idealistic plans to rear Chappie on a steady diet of poetry go sour when a group of South African gangsters (Ninja and Yolandi as Die Antwoord plus Jose Pablo Cantillo) kidnap Patel and forcibly adopt Chappie. In a rushed bit of narrative lead-up and one prolonged exquisite action sequence between the group and the South African police the film explains how the gang owe a local mob leader 20 million. The group lands upon the brilliant idea that Patel might have a ""remote control"" for turning the droids off during a grand heist; when he says thats impossible they take Chappie for their personal bodyguard instead.Blomkamps first feature-length movie the Oscar-nominated District 9 implicated several levels of bureaucracy in perpetrating crimes of xenophobia and speciesism. Though the android-cop premise is ripe for a further exploration of profiling Chappie is more about the unjust rule of law in the household than on the streets but its an angle thats just as brutal. Wilson wants to raise Chappie to read and paint; Ninja insists he learn how to walk with swagger swear and shoot. The disparities in their educational messaging moreover have some severe consequences Wilson makes Chappie promise he will realize his full potential and never shoot a gun; Ninja convinces him that throwing switchblades into peoples necks just puts them to sleep. The simplistic extremes in styles turn these older characters into caricatures but what child doesnt remember growing up in terms of dizzying highs and emotionally gutting catastrophes? The lack of subtlety is the element that makes the story so painfully familiar.Chappie ultimately draws a line between what constitutes the use and abuse of technology.Unsurprisingly for a film about the engineering of feeling Blomkamp and his production team overdo it on stylization. The home that Chappie grows up in is a garage furnished in graffiti bling and moldering domestic appliances an aesthetic inspired by the rave trappings of Die Antwoords NSFW music videos and zef style. The cinematography too looks at times like it was ripped straight from a rap video particularly in Chappies angsty teenage phase when hes trying to hang with the guys while also hung up on the morals that his Master instilled in his young mind. Hans Zimmers score is metallic synthetic insanely loud and eminently danceable. The violence is grotesque particularly when viewed through the lens of the young robot who learns what its like to be hit to be insulted to feel left out. These slights sting keenly even if its only bolts and joints that are spilling not blood--though theres plenty of that to go around.The sensory overload might be too much for some but Chappie ultimately draws a line between what constitutes the use and abuse of technology a prescription that it generally follows. The primary villain in the movie is Wilsons rival engineer at work Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) who has devised an alternate vision for the police force in the form of a drone-like droid that can be controlled remotely by a human called The Moose. For a robotic engineer Moore is an exceptionally unthinking villain His plot involves shutting down the android police force to set his Moose on the loose. When apprised of Chappies existence his great ambition is to dismember the robot like a seasoned Luddite torturer. Moore pushes the limits of what constitutes acceptable villainery Jackman muscles bulging Grinch-grinning mullet mercifully stashed away in the Mooses neurotransmitter when he demonstrates the firepower of his pet project embodies the humanist polar opposite of Wilsons compassionate respect for humanity. Hes a joystick-happy sadist who prefers his technology stone-cold and preferably equipped with the capability to launch multiple bombs at once.But its in these extraordinarily brutal sequences of one mans warped sickening virtual reality that Chappie makes its forward-thinking pitch--that theres more humanity to be found in reproducing consciousness and bestowing individuality into titanium bodies than in controlling them. Its this time-old message of humanity adapted to fit with todays technologies that transcends the overpowering at times clunky cinematic vessel.

Twitter previousThe Death of Textbooks?nextThe United States vs. Bob Menendez Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Its set in a near-future Johannesburg policed by robots but its not about law enforcement or social order. It focuses on the first creation of a sentient artificial intelligence yet its not about the consequences of this radical invention or the nature of consciousness. Instead though ""Chappie"" bears all the hallmarks of a ""RoboCop"" retread or a grungier ""A.I."" (or heaven help us ""Transcendence"") its actually more like a warped sci-fi version of ""The Jungle Book"" in which a child robot must survive the urban wilds of a gang-ridden Johannesburg. If it sounds like ""Chappie"" has some peculiar crisscrossed circuitry it most certainly does. The movies mismatched parts -- which includes possibly the most unlikely co-starring combo of all time the South African rap duo Die Antwoord and Hugh Jackman -- fit together about as well as Johnnie Five the ""Short Circuit"" bot and a blender. ""Chappie"" is the third feature from Blomkamp who broke through with the alien refugee thriller ""District 9"" and followed that up with ""Elysium"" a big-budget allegory in which the 1 percent live on an orbiting space station. His dystopias arent so unfamiliar. They marry great technological evolution with stunted social progress organically placing sci-fi elements amid recognizable bureaucracies and urban decay. Chappie movie trailer directed by Neill Blomkamp Scheduled to open March 6 2015 Blomkamp likes to invert tropes. Aliens come not to invade but as desperate immigrants. Robots evolve not to annihilate but to love. Both need our help. In short Blomkamp makes action-heavy sci-fi thats animated by political ideas and frustrated urgency more than most Hollywood science fiction combined. Its deservedly won him a following as well as the helm to the next ""Alien"" film. ""Chappie"" too is more spirited more bizarrely composed than most but its oddly jumbled machinery never clicks. The logic of ""Chappie"" gradually disintegrates becoming increasingly farcical. Eventually characters are speaking lines as finely scripted as ""I have authorized the launch of the Moose."" Dev Patel (""Slumdog Millionaire"") plays a wide-eyed ambitious engineer named Deon whose droids have already become the front lines of Johannesburgs police force. But he dreams of making a fully human robot even though his boss the CEO of a weapons company (Sigourney Weaver) shrugs that theres no money in it. A few cubicles down from him sits a rival engineer (Jackman) whose gargantuan heavy artillery ""Moose"" machine has been outshined by Deons more nimble human-like ""Scouts."" Slavishly tinkering at his home Deons A.I. software finally succeeds and he sneaks out a damaged droid to use as its body. His discovery though comes at a bad time. A trio of gangsters kidnaps him in an attempt to take out the police robots. Theyre led by Ninja and Yolandi of Die Antwoord the wild manic hip-hop act who essentially play themselves (or rather their extreme stage personas). Chappie vs. Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel All you need to know about this weeks new movies in less than 4 minutes NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune movie critic Mike Scott discusses this weeks new releases on Fox-8. They make Deon build his robot. With a few keystrokes he uploads consciousness and suddenly the bucket of bolts is cowering like a frightened fawn. To the disappointment of the gang but the glee of Deon Chappie (whom Yolandi names) comes out not a menacing enforcer but an innocent toddler in titanium. They collectively raise him teaching him with childrens books paints and guns. He coos ""Mommy"" to Yolandi and ""Daddy"" to Ninja. The education of Chappie born into gangsters pulls in two directions the caring tenderness of Yolandi and the tough love of Ninja who wants him to help in a heist. Yolandi gives him a doll while Ninja drops Chappie next to a gang leaving him to fend for himself. Another lesson on the dog-eat-dog world is told literally with dogs. And so ""Chappie"" against all odds is a parable of parenting about the raising of a metal child by a pair of wacked-out faux-gangsters in a tough universe. It feels it could at any time turn into a comedy or an outlandish music video and maybe it should have. Note Jake Coyle of The Associated Press wrote this review. ______________ CHAPPIE2 stars out of 5 Snapshot A near-future sci-fi fable about a robot who gains independent thought making him an immediate target of the fearful powers-that-be. What works Its more spirited than your average sci-fi film and writer-director Neill Blomkamp has an interesting way of inverting tropes. What doesnt The story never comes together satisfyingly as a whole. Instead its a jumbled criss-cross of mismatched circuitry and weird logic.

The power of that movie derived in part from the sardonic glance that it cast on racial divisions but those are barely touched upon here; if he holds anything up to scrutiny now (and you cant always tell amid the sound and fury) it is the unregulated craze for law and order. Gun-toting police drones are already on the streets but a young computer expert (Dev Patel) seeks something more refined a robot that can think and feel for itself. The result is Chappie (voiced by Sharlto Copley) who is no sooner created than he is hijacked by hoodlums and taught to dress talk and fight like a gang member. But will he obey only those instructions or somehow become a wiser and more delicate droid? And does the world really need artificially intelligent poets anyway? These questions are thrown away as the movie accelerates into brashness urged on by a phalanx of poor performances--the prime offenders being Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser from the South African rap-rave outfit Die Antwoord. Hugh Jackman dressed as a big-game hunter in shorts and boots and armed with a haircut that could stop a rhino plays the evil maker of another robot--a tank-style destroyer clearly borrowed from the set of ""RoboCop."" The principal charm of the film arises from Chappies ears which prick up and droop like those of a titanium rabbit.      --Anthony Lane Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

"Chappie - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Chappie Posted by Christy Lemire on March 10 2015 20 Comments Columbia Pictures Rated R for violence language and brief nudity. Running time 120 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. Do you know who Die Antwoord are? I didnt before walking into ""Chappie."" Not really. In retrospect Id vaguely heard of the South African rave-rap group because a fellow school mom mentioned to me about a year ago that she was seeing them in concert and that they were terrible but they were also a blast live. (Heres a link to their best-known song a catchy little ditty called ""I Fink U Freeky"" which has over 61 million YouTube views as of this writing. Youre welcome.) As you can see Die Antwoord are a singular artistic force. Theyre also the real stars of ""Chappie"" -- or at least two of the three members Ninja and Yo-Landi are. They are not actors nor are they truly ""acting"" per se but rather playing a version of themselves in all their tatted grungy glory. Director Neill Blomkamp who made a splash in 2009 with his bad-ass sci-fi debut ""District 9"" said he listened to a lot of Die Antwoord while working on his 2013 follow-up the disappointing ""Elysium."" So voila Ninja and Yo-Landi are the stars of ""Chappie."" Not Dev Patel. Not Hugh Jackman. Not even Hugh Jackmans mullet. Ninja and Yo-Landi are the ones who propel the narrative -- although the script which Blomkamp co-wrote with his wife Terri Tatchell doesnt go in any directions you havent been many times before. ""Chappie"" is essentially a mash-up of ""RoboCop"" ""Short Circuit"" and ""Transcendence."" It raises all the questions about artificial intelligence and the nebulous relationship between man and machine which weve pondered in superior films from ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" to ""WarGames"" to ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" to ""Her."" But it provides no novel answers no fresh insight. While the visual effects are spectacularly seamless theyre in the service of a movie which devolves from vaguely funny to just-plain silly to numbingly gory. In the beginning its the near future 2016 to be exact. Things have gone to hell pretty quickly it appears from fake news footage but especially in Blomkamps hometown of Johannesburg. The government has put a robot police force in place to keep the peace the brainchild of mild-mannered engineer Deon Wilson (Patel). His boss at the private defense firm is the icily ambitious American Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver); his office rival is ex-military the devious Vincent Moore played by Jackman as a collection of bad Australian stereotypes (mullet khaki shorts hiking boots weaponry on his hip). But Deon has dreams of using the technology to create something greater more sophisticated. After many sleepless nights he finally devises a method of artificial intelligence which he wants to place inside one of these robot police officers to see how much better they can work when they think and feel for themselves. Naturally his project doesnt go nearly as well as planned when the test robot falls into the criminal hands of Ninja Yo-Landi and their sidekick Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) who only want to use the creation to pull off a big heist. The thing with Ninja and Yo-Landi is its difficult to tell whether were supposed to take them seriously or think theyre ridiculous. Ninja is an overconfident trash-talking buffoon but hes also an expert shot and he can be legitimately dangerous. Yo-Landi seems vapid and soulless but functioning as an ersatz mother to the robot -- whom she names Chappie -- brings out a softer and warmer side which makes her strangely relatable. While theyre initially off-putting they admittedly become fascinating; but a little of them goes a long way especially in an overlong film. Chappie himself meanwhile is annoying from start to finish. Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley portrays the robot through motion capture and voice work. While the physicality of the performance is impressive as he evolves from skittish child to swaggering gangster the consistently hyperactive one-note way Copley delivers his dialogue remains grating throughout. Unfortunately comparisons to Jar Jar Binks are all too apt. The fight for Chappies survival becomes a fight for the survival of the entire city when Vincent sabotages the robot police squad in order to unleash his own behemoth military-inspired crime-fighting force. Blomkamp essentially abandons the intellectual and moral themes hed presented earlier in favor of sheer brute strength. ""Chappie"" gets overloaded with noisy repetitive carnage as it reaches its climax then shifts jarringly into empty uplift. The movie itself may not stay with you for very long after its over but Die Antwoords music does -- for better or worse.

At what point does it become ""numbingly gory""? There is one scene of any substantial gore involved for 3 seconds and the next goriest is a variety of minor gun shot wounds and one non-gory beating of Hugh Jackman. Based on your opinion District 9 was a bloodbath and The Shining was also ""numbingly gory"" Reply March 15 2015  by  Eric     Define over exaggeration though she does have a point. It was almost vanilla (aside from the consistent swearing) up until the point that we see the moose in action. The sudden and almost random introduction to someone being ripped in half was completely unnecessary to the plot - it was gore for the sake of gore. Reply March 23 2015  by  jaybo     Thats all Blomkamp does in my opinion Reply March 11 2015  by  Andrew jojola     This article is just an example of Christies poor ability to analyze break down the components of what shes is seeing. To start chappie is not mocap animated Sharlto Copley is on set and acts the way any actor would and a team of animators animate chappie frame by frame over Copleys performance all by hand. It doesnt surprise me that she would misrepresent information to make the movie seem bad when any one with half a brain would tell you its great. The problem with the negatively portrayed articles not limited to chappie is that hard headed individuals assume if they dont like a movie then it must be bad when in actuality they just dont like it. Their a lot of articles saying chappie is bad and most of those articles are based on ""it was confusing"" it was too gory"" die antwood are not actors"". All this shows is that those who dislike the movie are to slow to understand it or dislike a specific character with in it which is a poor basis to judge a movie. A wise friend of mine once told me"" why do you get mad at games for not being realistic? You dont play Mario kart and say HEY SHELLS DONT SHOOT OUT OF GOKARTS IN REAL LIFE You play the game to play the game wether or not you like it is up to you."" Your judgment is based in ignorance and your view is entirely to contrived. By the way their Is no such thing as ""this movie is a mash up"" while movies can be similar this movie is no mash up. For one theirs only one so one robo cop for two transcendence is about nano technology more than anything and lastly I havent even seen short circuit but based on your inability to evaluate movies for their self worth Im not going to trust your judgment on this in the least bit.Rule one of writing anything site check your facts. I hope this isnt your day job because your terrible at it. Reply March 12 2015  by  Poo     Actually the plot is the plot of robo cop and short circuit 2...even down to the criminals using him for their dirty work...lol Reply March 13 2015  by  Matt51     Actually this was a pretty sound review Im not at all sure what yr venoms all about mate. There was a lot more she could have mentioned in the way of bad points... And Id say it was a complete mash-up. I love good Scifi I also really like Die Antwoord; this should have been amazing and it was almost resoundingly terrible. If youre not worried about Aliens by now... Actually scrub that youll probably love it Reply March 13 2015  by  JozieLee     JarJar Binks? Egads thats enough to turn me off. Reply March 15 2015  by  Donny     This is the most ignorant review I have ever read. A disgrace Reply March 15 2015  by  Tronia     How is this person listed as a critic on rottentomatoes.com? Wow. Can anyone with a blog get listed there? Reply June 27 2015  by  Trevor     She wrote for the Associated Press for a decade and hosted a show with Roger Ebert. I think shes qualified... Reply March 15 2015  by  Sanqtiago     Wow. This is a pretty bad review. Mashup? Are you talking intertextuality? Because you make it sound is a bad thing. Also are you looking to find ""answers"" to problems like AI in movies? Good Luck. Perhaps I dont think ""solving"" or revealing the secrets of the human conscious was at the center of Chappie; rather than ontological I believe the quid of the movie is more ethical. But who am I kidding the movie is so damn good it could be about ""being machine"" too. Reply March 16 2015  by  robthom     I appreciate Blomkamps desire to be a writer/director auteur but his writing is at nowhere near the level of his visual talents. And its probably holding him back. Carpenter and Chronenberg were great writers themselves early in their careers but werent afraid to use a script by others to focus on directing. Reply March 16 2015  by  David Molina     Hey im French so dont take this seriously. Dont blame the writer for not seeing the Art behind the movie. Not everyone is sensitive to Art. Anyway maybe in the future people will understand this movie for what it really is. Peace. Reply March 16 2015  by  Ivan Martinez Olvera     Dear Christy whatever I just seen chappie and outside the cinema i just ask myself ""will any asshole think that chappie Is just about the ""robot-human relation?"" Damn wrong this is not about that you need to see a little faar than just that you dont even see the context is about some concepts and questions deepers than the movies you enounce is not about robots is about real kids in crime their innocence the masculine figure stoling them from the mother and a lot of situations around it it also gets a little bit existencialism in the relation ""creation-creator"".... those things and more but I will keep thinking before being an asshole... of course this is still a sci fi movie but higher a lot higher than robocop this is a movie that I wont regret to pay for (scuse my english) Reply March 18 2015  by  Chris G     Im not mad at your review. One problem ""Chappie like jar jar Binks"" Hell no Chappie is way better and has his own personality. Chappie hands down was a good movie. Ok similarities to other scifis. So what? Its funny and has a lot of action. Die antwoord was an awesome choice. Teens and young adults will love this move. Its fooly cooly but gangsta I will say it did come off at times like a long music video amp; marketing movie for die antwoord... SO Chappie protected his family. Reply March 18 2015  by  Kevin     Did you bother to go see the movie? You stated that ""it provides no novel answers no fresh insight"" but do not prove your point. Were you unable to see the accurate family archetypes that the film presented? Could you not see the ideas of a new frame of dealing with the creator to creation? There was much more to this movies appetite than entertaining movie goers and pissing off stuffy critics. I highly recommend you you go back and watch the film before you write a review Reply March 19 2015  by  Dean     The song that propped Die Antwoord to stardom their first youtube hit was Enter the Ninja and not I think your freaky. Its the song the movie played out with... Reply March 25 2015  by  CF     I think the review is pretty spot-on. It took me about an hour and a half to decide if we were supposed to take any of it seriously (due to the ridiculous factor) but at 2 hours I just stopped caring. Visually it was impressive but story-wise I found myself waiting and praying for Chappies battery to die out. Or at the very least his voice box. Reply July 17 2016  by  Cre-Ator     The thing aboit this movie is that it has an amazing story and thongs we need time to ponder over. Yeah screenplay and cinematography was quirky but its the weird story that attracts you. The only downside i see is the mismathing caste who cant seem to support each other. Was saddened to see one o my favorites Jackman and the brilliant Dev beside Die Antwoord XD Reply July 17 2016  by  Cre-Ator     about thing my bad  Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

"Chappie | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; chappie ) Chappie (United States/Mexico 2015) March 06 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Chappie the latest science fiction endeavor from South African director Neill Blomkamp isnt just a disappointment; it represents a misfire. Its as if the filmmaker took a number of recognizable science fiction tropes tossed them into a blender and arrived at this mishmash of undercooked ideas and undeveloped characters. An ode to artificial intelligence Chappie seems not to realize that stories about synthetic characters achieving sentience have moved beyond the realm of high tech Pinocchios. Like Blomkamps breakout District 9 Chappie takes place in a near-future South Africa. With crime out-of-control the Johannesburg police department unveils a program that places robot cops on the front lines. (Large parts of Robocop appear to have been appropriated for this film along with bits and pieces of Short Circuit.) The creator of the Scout program Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) is lauded by his companys CEO Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) - much to the chagrin of Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) a rival developer whose oversized Moose robot has been pushed to the side in favor of the Scouts. Deon who is interested in A.I. ""operates"" on a damaged Scout later to be named Chappie (frequent Blomkamp collaborator Sharlto Copley provides the voice and motion capture work) and transforms him into real live boy. But Chappie falls into the hands of bumbling gangsters Ninja (Ninja) Yolandi (Yo-Landi Visser) and Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) who want to use him in a major heist that will net them the money they owe to crime boss Hippo (Brandon Auret). Chappie finds himself bombarded by conflicting moral codes (Deons non-violence and Ninjas shoot-to-kill) while his damaged battery leaks energy. Meanwhile back at the office Vincent plans his next move. Criminally underwritten characters result in actors like Hugh Jackman Sigourney Weaver and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) having little to do. Jackman does his best Snidely Whiplash impersonation - he deserves better. Patels Deon is given no personality beyond his moral code and a Geppetto-like obsession. The most interesting thing about Sigourney Weaver is that she again appears in a movie where the A.I. gets out of control but shes on-screen for so little time that her part qualifies as a glorified cameo. By limiting the exposure of his well-known stars Blomkamp is able to highlight the ""work"" of Ninja and Yolandi of the music group Die Antwoord whose performances vary from awkward to grating. Then theres Chappie who is probably intended to be a cross between E.T. and C3PO but comes across as closer to Jar-Jar Binks in terms of audience appeal. Although the script for Chappie is riddled with problems the middle section is the most seriously flawed. During this part Chappie is presented as a child with a thirst for learning who laps up the lessons of his ""mother"" Yolandi and ""father"" Ninja. The sequences are often played for comedy which indicates a shocking tone deafness on the part of Blomkamp since the inescapable conclusion of the allegory is that the child is being abused and neglected. In one horrific scene Chappie is brutalized and loses an arm. Granted Robocop contained its share of hard-to-watch scenes but Paul Verhoeven understood how to use those moments to make a point. In Chappie such material seems as gratuitous as it is ugly. Blomkamp wants to use Chappie to offer commentary about topics as diverse as the shallowness of corporate culture societys rejection of non-conformists and the plight of the undertrodden. Normally science fiction could be considered a good vehicle for such thematic explorations (that was the case with District 9 and to a lesser extent Elysium) but Chappies presentation is strident and off-putting. Blomkamps approach never use a chisel when a sledgehammer will do. Chappies story is never compelling - the character is too irritating - and Blomkamps unwillingness to dig beneath the surface of things like the morality of putting a human consciousness in a mechanical body is frustrating. There are also some basic real-world gaffes that damage the films credibility such as the ease with which Vincent commits his sabotage - dont they use security cameras in 2016? Its hard to ascertain who the audience is for Chappie. Theres not enough action to entice those who demand a high level of energy from special effects-laden efforts. The allegorical aspects are too poorly handled for science fiction fans to show more than a cursory interest. And the human characters are so sketchily drawn that theres minimal dramatic potential. Theres material in Chappie for a worthwhile motion picture but too little is explored by Blomkamp to make this worth a trip to a theater.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 06 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Mar. 06 2015 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Neill Blomkamp Written by Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell Starring Dev Patel Hugh Jackman Sharlto Copley Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser Classification 14A Country USA Language English A movie about a robot policeman given a childlike conscience Chappie is one of those incongruous Franken-films thats simultaneously bombastically brutal and treacly. Like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial crossed with Transformers or RoboCop starring Jar Jar Binks its a recipe guaranteed to produce aesthetic indigestion. The third feature from South African director Neill Blomkamp (District 9 Elysium) shot with his signature documentary-style hand-held camera urgency is set in a gang-infested Johannesburg of the near future where the police employ thousands of ""scout"" robots on the streets. In the drab cubicle-filled offices of the arms manufacturer who makes the robot guardians theres a rivalry between two of the engineers. Geeky genius Deon (Dev Patel) who designed the nimble man-sized robots that police the streets now wants to take it up a notch uploading enough terabytes of data into a robots operating system to give it a ""conscience."" His glowering rival Vincent (Hugh Jackman in a risibly ugly mullet) offers a Razzie-worthy performance as a rogue engineer who has staked his career on a clunky human-operated machine the size of a three-storey building called the Moose.Profit-focused CEO Michelle (Sigourney Weaver in her stern schoolteacher mode) tells both boys to play within the rules Theres no need for Deons proposed sensitive robots who like art and poetry or Vincents monster machine that looks like a multicar pileup. Naturally both men disobey the boss though the Moose arrives noisily late in the movie.No sooner has Deon stolen a damaged robot shell for his pet project than he gets kidnapped by a team of bottom-feeding gangsters who force him to bring it to life. The robots new ""mommy"" Yolandi and ""daddy"" Ninja played by the eccentrically brilliant South African rap-rave duo Die Antwoord (Afrikaans for the Answer) who also contribute to the soundtrack (otherwise a lot of synth hums and growls from Hans Zimmer). The craggy string-bean Ninja and the tiny doll-like Yo-Landi Visser make up in presence what they lack in acting chops giving the film a hope for cult appeal. The helium-voiced Yolandi names the robot Chappie and starts having maternal or at least pet-owner feelings for the metal skeleton (played in motion capture by actor Sharlto Copley). Chappies main forms of expression are to scuttle about like a nervous puppy and do voice impressions of his new minders.The near-interminable middle stretch of the film is about the educational options open to fledgling robots. Patels Deon while huffily appalled at these crude folk does nothing to get his robot back and instead comes and goes like a guilty absentee dad bringing Chappie childrens books and painting sets. Meanwhile Ninja and his knife-wielding accomplice (Jose Pablo Cantillo) offer Chappie another kind of education training Chappie to swagger like a ""No. 1 robot gangsta"" or to kill people by making them ""go sleepy-weepy"" and wear tacky gold chains all of which is supposed to be hilarious but isnt.As an improbable part of his education they drop their expensive toy in a bad neighbourhood where hes beaten by thugs who mistake him for a helpless robot cop. At another point Chappie gets captured by the evil Vincent and he complains to his foster parents that something bad was done to him by a ""man in a van."" Again really not that hilarious.Movies themselves are a kind of sentient machine and there is a distinguished lineage of films that have explored these paradoxical creations from Maria in Fritz Langs Metropolis to Gort in The Day the Earth Stood Still to Hal 9000 and Wall-E. Of the lot Chappie is a particularly resistible bag of gun-metal plates and bolts an almost faceless chatterbox stuck at an adolescent awkward age.As a director Blomkamp has a distinctive scrappy visual sensibility and political perspective but he cant find a heart in Chappie a movie of poorly motivated one-note characters illogical action and trite musings on artificial intelligence. Among words that rhyme with the title ""happy"" is not at the top of the list.

Rather than boring you with a sermon on how and why this was always likely to turn out badly lets move on to the evidence. Between his dynamite debut with ""District 9"" and now Blomkamp made ""Elysium"" with Matt Damon a movie from the Land of Intriguing Premises that so many high-concept Hollywood star vehicles cannot escape. (As in ""Well it had an intriguing premise."") I can dimly remember some scenes of futuristic mayhem that might be from ""Elysium."" They might also be from the Tom Cruise movie ""Oblivion"" or the other Tom Cruise movie ""Edge of Tomorrow"" or any number of other things some of which dont have Tom Cruise. Maybe theyre all from ""Jupiter Ascending"" which erased all those films and then erased itself.Anyway even if Blomkamp gets a pass on ""Elysium"" that only raises the stakes on his new robo-action-comedy spectacle ""Chappie."" Written by Blomkamp with his wife Terri Tatchell this movie returns to the crime-ridden chaotic context of his native Johannesburg which he exploited and transformed so brilliantly in ""District 9."" It even features Sigourney Weaver although in a small and forgettable role where she yells at people from behind a desk. Its a near-future tale about a junked crime-fighting robot (voiced by Blomkamps frequent collaborator Sharlto Copley) who becomes the worlds first true artificial intelligence and who then learns to wear loads of outrageous bling and speak in a ridiculous Afrikaans-American gangsta patois. And its the movie that might singlehandedly kill the buzz over the ""Alien"" reboot if not kill off the project entirely.Its not just that ""Chappie"" is a mishmash of familiar ingredients whose story quickly slides off the rails into a swamp of action-movie cliches or another misbegotten project from the Land of Intriguing Premises. It doesnt have an intriguing premise in the first place. Its cluttered goofy and incoherent from beginning to end and much too long. (Can we agree to hate the rule that science-fiction movies must run at least two full hours?) It gives me no pleasure to say this but this movie is very often really really stupid. Its attempts at comedy are embarrassingly weak and its attempts at sentimental humanism are insulting. ""TRON Legacy"" was a better movie with a purer spirit. ""Jupiter Ascending"" was much better. ""John Carter"" the 300 million disaster that shook Disney to its foundations looks like a masterpiece of imaginative cinema compared to ""Chappie."" (Yes I know The problem with ""John Carter"" was not the movie itself but the commercial expectations.)You almost cant compare ""Chappie"" with Pixars ""WALL-E"" (directed by Andrew Stanton the would-be Kubrick whose career was then incinerated by ""John Carter"") which touches on similar themes but is a vastly more sophisticated adventurous and yes grown-up motion picture. I was going to make a joke about ""Chappie"" being for people who find Pixar movies too slow but that really isnt fair. For all the manic enthusiasm and tribal loyalty of the sci-fi audience even Blomkamps core believers will have a tough time circling the wagons around this one. Its not the worst movie of the year just a boring and inconsequential one that will soon be forgotten and will add a second flat tire to a once-promising career.Its not like Blomkamp has forgotten how to direct action scenes or lost his feeling for atmosphere. Its just that the subjective ground-level action choreography he pioneered in ""District 9"" has now become ubiquitous - and that his feeling for atmosphere still seems to be defined by ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."" (I hate to contemplate how many times Blomkamp watched that as a kid.) ""Chappie"" is a leaden and labored slog the work of a guy who had one really good idea and used it up and is now desperately trying to rediscover the magic. It mashes up several obvious science-fiction plots and scenarios including ""Frankenstein"" ""RoboCop"" and ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" with some other borrowings that arent as obvious. Blomkamp and Tatchell have heavily ripped off the story of ""Oliver Twist"" as implausible as that may sound ""Chappie"" is the tale of an innocent raised amid a den of thieves who is saved from the wages of sin by the self-sacrificing love of a surrogate mother. You Might Also Like All those competing themes and influences might not be a big problem if it felt like Blomkamp was in command of the pacing the material or the characters. Instead we bounce around haphazardly for two full hours between a bunch of poorly worked-out story fragments. Dev Patel of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" plays an eager young robotics engineer at the evil corporation run by Weaver who now believes he has cracked the artificial-intelligence code. Hugh Jackman (who like Weaver seems to have been on set for a day or two) is a thoroughly stereotypical ex-military meathead villain. Then theres the supposedly hilarious trio of low-grade thugs played by the members of South African hip-hop group Die Antwoord which comes under the heading of ""must have seemed like a good idea at the time."" In fairness the preening moronic swagger of rapper Ninja is more fun to watch in a reality-TV vein than anything else in ""Chappie"" but how much acting is involved in his performance I really couldnt say.I can appreciate that there are some in-jokes at work here in a John Carpenter vein including the appeal to Die Antwoord fans and the unanimously terrible haircuts sported by the painfully dumb South African white dudes. But the plot in which the newborn Chappie is abducted and trained by criminals and then targeted for assassination by Jackmans killer robot (which looks exactly like the bad robots in the ""RoboCop"" remake) is just a recycled afterthought semi-concealed by bits of fake news broadcast featuring the real Anderson Cooper. Seriously that particular gambit - pimping out ""real"" TV talking heads to legitimize apocalypse movies - stopped being startling in 1997. As far as who is good and whos evil who will be redeemed and who punished I refer you back to Dickens. As for Chappie himself a mechanical newborn with a puppyish eagerness to please and wiggly electronic ears to match - oh dear. He never feels like the movies centerpiece and isnt even in the movie that much maybe because hes a lame sketch-comedy concept rather than a character Lets have Sharlto Copley mangle some obscenities in a dorky robot voice (Once youve heard somebody mix up the syllables of the word ""motherfucker"" its just not as funny the second time or the fifth.) I kept hoping Chappie would get crushed into scrap metal so I wouldnt be subjected to his supposedly adorable malapropisms anymore but no such luck. Like this entire movie Chappie is an idea vaguely sketched out on a napkin which led the geniuses of Hollywood to open their pocketbooks and then went nowhere. Its OK I guess that Blomkamp wanted to make a lightweight entertainment that bounces off heavy-duty questions of crime and poverty and artificial intelligence and the nature of consciousness without taking any of them seriously. (We can set aside the discussion of his confused political perspective since it really doesnt matter.) But what he came back with just isnt any fun. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

From Ridley Scotts Blade Runner to last years Transcendence these stories that ponder the gap between man and machine often reveal filmmakers unsure of where they fit in -- they get so involved in the question that they forget to create real characters to ask it.South African director Neill Blomkamp is a different breed. Since his debut District 9 hes shown he knows where he stands Hes sided against Homo sapiens for being judgmental and cruel. His sci-fi flicks are thick with emotion as though Rutger Hauers dying replicant put down the white dove and picked up a camera.In Blomkamps latest Chappie he creates a robot martyr doomed to die for our sins. Shot in the heart -- er battery -- in the line of duty Chappies innards have fused leaving him only enough charge for five days of use. His corporate maker Deon (Dev Patel) rescues him from the scrap heap and implants an experimental conscience chip turning the bot into a newborn who has to relearn everything. (Voiced by Sharlto Copley his second word is ""chicken."") But Deon must fight for custody against a trio of thugs who want to use Chappies brawn to pull off a multimillion-dollar heist. And worse Chappies decided two of them (Die Antwoords Yo-Landi Visser and Ninja acting under those names) are his mommy and daddy. Courtesy of Columbia Pictures Blomkamp and co-writer Terri Tatchells script solders RoboCop onto Three Men and a Baby and sets the proceedings in a demented abandoned-building nursery/bootcamp where the guns bricks and punching bags are all innocent pastels. Even the truly scary Ninja is covered in childlike doodles his own such as a tattoo of a boy with a massive penis. Ninja and the albino-mulleted Yo-Landi are alien screen presences as weird as Blomkamps actual aliens in District 9 and weirder than the ghetto-slanging Chappie whos just another descendant in a long line of rapping robots and rapping grannies. For musicians they act fine. Their fashion sense is the special effect and Blomkamp lets them dress like themselves even when that means wearing their own band shirts a conundrum of real-world and story-world logic that makes our brains overheat.

Parents also will realize that Chappie isnt for kids. After a cloying early stretch Ninja toughens up his robot by exposing him to the worst of humanity. By the time the battery-drained Chappie pets a dead fighting pit bull while begging ""Why did my maker create me only to die?"" the film has cut open its own soul and is pleading with us to love it.Its hard not to despite Chappies obvious faults. The plot is silly the gears are loud and good actors including Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver are simply set loose to chew the scenery. But theres something fearlessly uncool about the film which suffers mostly from being made 30 years too late. The sci-fi purists who will roll their eyes at it and go home and rewind their Verhoeven would have ranked Chappie as a classic if theyd seen it at the right emotionally scarring young age. After all what movies and machines have in common is that both can be wired all wrong yet still work just right. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Photo Columbia Pictures Its easy to imagine the writers pitch forA ChappieA went something along the lines of ""AvatarA meetsA RoboCopA meetsA Short CircuitA starring Jar Jar Binks."" Im kidding Jar Jar was probably left out of that meeting but hes in the movie in spirit reincarnated as a sentient robot whose mind evolves quickly from childlike to sophisticated but who continues to babble in the same pidgin English. Directed byA District 9s Neill BlomkampA ChappieA is a clunky mix a sentimental comedy-thriller with hideous violence and a profound cynicism about the inexorability of the computer-enhanced surveillance state. It gets points for weirdness but its still some fucked-up shit. The context -- spelled out by Anderson Cooper who should stop playing himself in fictional movies because it undermines his dignity even more than his silly laugh and surely his country house is paid for by now -- is that Johannesburg has the first robotic police force its manufacture overseen by bossypants Sigourney Weaver (in a rare paycheck performance). Among her employees is a sweet nerdy Indian guy (Dev Patel marginally more believable on account of being an actual Indian than Fisher Stevens in Short Circuit) who dreams of instilling consciousness in these buckets of bolts. On the other side of the humanist equation is Hugh Jackman as an incipient fascist whod love the police to employ his prize-flying robot behemoths that can wipe out whole blocks without breaking a sweat. Chappies wild card -- its most original aspect -- is the invention of three unsavory Road Warrior-esque paramilitary punks who kidnap Patel and allow him to finish his A.I. experiment so they can use his near-unstoppable robot (whom they dub ""Chappie"") in a heist. (The need to pay off a debt to a vicious gorillalike gang leader.) Ninja (played by Ninja) is the cut-muscled tattooed bull-boy but its blonde eyebrowless Yolandi (rocker Yo-Landi Visser) who turns unexpectedly maternal and makes Chappie her little boy. Chappie -- articulated by Blomkamp mascot Sharlto Copley -- has his finer points. As a scaredy-cat ""child"" he throws up his steel arms and cowers spastically behind pieces of furniture and his clumsy use of gangsta slang is funny in small doses. I like his tin-man mandibles and square peepers. But that voice It really is as if Jar Jar and C-3PO had mated to create the worlds most insufferable automaton. Chappie (both the character and the film) might have been saved if his awakening had a trace of awe if the miracle of his existence didnt seem so taken-for-granted. But theres nothing miraculous poetic or even fresh about Blomkamps palette. The cartoonishness of District 9s extraterrestrial shrimp turned out to be the key to the films charm -- a bigger budget exposes his flat network-TV techniques and he cant begin to reconcile Chappies wildly disparate tones. Patel and Jackman dont rise above their material but Yo-Landi and Ninja do. He keeps up the one-note psycho bit for half the movie before confusion sets in His robot is playing with dolls and his murderous moll has been rendered boneless by sudden mommyhood. My initial aversion to Visser yielded to Chappie-like feelings of love. A few notes of softness mixed into her patented hardness becomes her. To give him his due Blomkamp knows the value -- amid this computerized jumble -- of a human voice.

Photo Credit Sony Pictures / TNS advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A newly created sentient robot is forced to fight for his life. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE A loud and unpleasant ""RoboCop"" rehash that gives us no one to root for and nothing to think about CAST Dev Patel Hugh Jackman Sigourney Weaver LENGTH 200 The South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp gave Hollywood a jolt of creative electricity with his 2009 debut ""District 9"" an inventive and wickedly funny parable about space-alien apartheid on planet Earth. His disappointing follow-up ""Elysium"" tackled two not-so-sexy issues -- immigration and health-care reform -- with such simplistic thinking and contrived storytelling that it seemed to come from a different director. Blomkamps fans surely hoped that his latest ""Chappie"" about a sentient robot forced to fight for his life would be a return to form. But Blomkamps form is beginning to look a little poor. ""Chappie"" is a loud chaotic sci-fi flick that never rises above the cliches of its genre. Whatever interesting ideas it has -- perhaps something about consciousness and human nature -- are lost in Blomkamps wildly disorganized screenplay written with his wife Terri Tatchell. Their model here is clearly Paul Verhoevens 1987 classic ""RoboCop"" but where that movie gave us bloody good fun ""Chappie"" offers mostly mean-spirited violence and a generally dismal worldview. advertisement | advertise on newsday There are built-in pleasures in the story of ""Chappie"" but Blomkamp consistently finds ways to keep them from us. Chappie played via motion-capture by Sharlto Copley is a damaged police robot salvaged by an engineer Deon (Dev Patel) who successfully imbues him with artificial intelligence. Theres no fun in watching Chappie grow and learn however because hes been captured by two abusive criminals (Ninja and Yolandi Vier of the South African shock-rap band Die Antwoord) who mostly teach him violence and bad manners. When Chappie does finally fight back its not against them but oddly enough against a human-controlled robot called The Moose. Its operator is Deons overly ambitious co-worker Vincent (Hugh Jackman in a half-mullet). Sigourney Weaver appears in a blip of a role as their chilly boss Michelle Bradley. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviewsMore coverageRafer Guzmans latest The movies impoverished notions of technology -- the usual thumb-drives and downloads -- could be overlooked if we were given other things to think about. Chappies transformation from sweet-natured child to enraged killing machine however is emotionally unsatisfying and as a life-story of sorts rather depressing. ""Chappie"" is a cold and creatively bankrupt film from a director who has yet to live up to his potential.

Its time for a recount Blomkamps latest ""Chappie"" is an inexplicable sci-fi dud a mashup of ""Robocop"" and ""Wall-E"" that somehow becomes a two-hour commercial for South African novelty rap act Die Antwoord and its merchandise line.In ""Chappies"" not-too-distant future the streets of Johannesburg are policed by robots and a young programmer (""Slumdog Millionaires"" Dev Patel) creates an artificial intelligence program that allows the robots to think learn and feel.But his prototype is stolen by a pair of hooligans (Die Antwoords Ninja and Yolandi Visser) who live in an abandoned industrial plant and are planning a 20 million heist. Their plan turn the robot whom they name Chappie into the ""illest gangsta"" and let him do the work for them.Edited down to four minutes it would be a pretty cool music video and it might be able to establish a consistent tone. But as a feature the alternately violent slap-sticky and sappy ""Chappie"" is all over the place employing a cloying ""Patch Adams""-like sentimentality and abandoning logic at every turn. Characters played by Hugh Jackman (as a bloodthirsty military grunt with a horrific mullet) and Sigourney Weaver (as a bottom line-obsessed CEO) are so one-dimensional its comical and the ""Robocop"" rip-off is so blatant the movie comes with its own souped-up version of the ED-209.And then theres Die Antwoord whose severe haircuts and loud clothing strike a curious weirdo visual but theyre not movie stars and theyre certainly not actors. The fact that they dress in Die Antwoord T-shirts enters the film into the realm of bizarre and at the very least calls into question where did they get those T-shirts?What Blomkamp (who also directed 2013s ""Elysium"") owed the duo is unclear and hopefully his debts are cleared. But ""Chappie"" is a blemish on his record that makes ""District 9"" seem like a distant fluke.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaChappieGRADE D-Rated R for violence language and brief nudityRunning time 120 minutes 19 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1BN8yhM MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/03/06/place-chappie-inexplicable-dud/24458021/,200,chappie13,chappie,detroitnews

Photo Columbia Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Chappie Running time 120 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence much profanity and brief nudity). ""Short Circuit"" meets ""RoboCop"" -- with asides to ""WALL-E"" ""E.T."" ""The Road Warrior"" and many other better movies -- in ""Chappie"" an interminable violent incoherent and wearying R-rated sci-fi action comedy. Director Neill Blomkamp who shot to international prominence with the clever apartheid allegory ""District 9 (nominated for a Best Picture Oscar) bludgeons the audience with stale political satire bloody shootouts carjackings tear-jerking -- and even an Anderson Cooper cameo -- for two solid hours. I havent been as happy to see a movie end since the third ""Transformers."" Motion capture artist and ""District 9 veteran Sharlto Copley provides the voice and movements for the digitally rendered Chappie. Hes a damaged police robot who in 2016 is secretly rescued from a corporate scrap heap and upgraded with artificial intelligence and human feelings by his creator Deon (Dev Patel). Deon is kidnapped by a couple of hotheaded Johannesburg gangbangers and their unsavory cohorts who want to gain control of the entire army of crimefighting police robots Deon has created. (The gangbangers are played by Yo-Landi Visser and the singly named Ninja of the South African rave group Die Antwoord who shouldnt give up their night jobs.) These gun-waving bad guys inexplicably let Deon go but keep Chappie raising him as a jivetalking bling-wearing gangsta who assists them in drug deals and stealing cars while Chappie brings out Vissers latent maternal instincts. Meanwhile back at the evil corporation where Deon works rogue colleague Vincent (Hugh Jackman in a mullet and shorts) discovers Deon has reengineered Chappie. Hugh Jackman stars as Vincent in ""Chappie.""Photo Stephanie Blomkamp Im not sure how but Vincent uses his finding to sabotage all of Deons robots so he can persuade their craven boss (Sigourney Weaver) to let Vincent unleash his own creation a larger heavily armed (but human controlled) robot named the Moose. Its not exactly giving anything away to reveal that the films big action set piece pits the Moose against you guessed it scrawny little Chappie. Well it beats watching characters bent over computer screens and getting error messages which takes up way too much of the running time. Kevin Otto and Sigourney Weaver in ""Chappie.""Photo Stephanie Blomkamp Practically none of this makes much sense even in a sci-fi fantasy context but then this is a movie filled with WTF moments -- especially when Vincent puts a revolver to Deons head in the office during the middle of the business day to get him to hand over a computer passkey. This movie fails on many levels. The childlike Chappie is apparently meant to be charming and funny but he really isnt either (and good luck trying to understand his thick patois). A la ""E.T. Chappie also has a battery thats running out and cant be replaced -- which isnt particularly touching and cues a convoluted subplot in which characters can transfer the ""consciousness of robots and people into other robots with a few computer keystrokes. Populated by unlikable one-note characters (with broad performances to match) in hugely unappealing settings ""Chappie should have stayed on the scrap heap. If you must see this dont bring the kids.

"Chappie is a bolted-together robot movie that is far from riveting review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesChappie is a bolted-together robot movie that is far from riveting reviewSci-fi filmmaker Neill Blomkamp bolts together used and stolen parts for his robot movie Chappie and the lamentable result is far from riveting.Dev Patel boots up Chappie in Neill Blomkamps robot story. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 5 2015ChappieStarring Sharlto Copley Dev Patel Ninja Yolandi Visser Hugh Jackman Jose Pablo Cantillo and Sigourney Weaver. Written and directed by Neill Blomkamp. Opens March 6 at GTA theatres. 120 minutes. 14ASci-fi filmmaker Neill Blomkamp bolts together used and stolen parts for his robot movie Chappie and the lamentable result is far from riveting.This clanking third feature from the South African writer/director feels a lot like his first and second ones District 9 and Elysium. Hes once again working a ""them versus us"" future shock scenario incorporating faux documentary elements and assigning a key role to his actor pal Sharlto Copley this time as the title robot.Article Continued BelowBlomkamp also revisits ideas from his earlier short films -- particularly Tetra Vaal and Adicolor Yellow both viewable on YouTube -- while plundering innumerable (and better) movies about sentient machines among them Short Circuit RoboCop and WALL-E.The guy should be running a recycling centre not making big-budget movie blockbusters -- and this goes double for the Aliens sequel hes bafflingly been green-lighted for.Yet Chappie is curiously missing something that added distinction to Blomkamps previous features a social conscience. His 2009 debut feature District 9 set in the South African capital city Johannesburg dramatized the evils of the countrys now-abandoned Apartheid policy with its fenced-off ghetto of space aliens stranded marginalized and mistreated on Earth. Blomkamps 2013 followup Elysium grander of bankroll and star power but lesser of vision had orbiting one-percenters trying to protect their space station Shangri-la from desperate 99-percenters down below.Chappie doesnt have much of anything to say unless you still need the lesson that allowing machines to assume control of humanity is a bad idea. Didnt we learn this already from RoboCop Terminator and The Matrix not to mention the Internet Google and Facebook?Returning to Joburg one year into the future Blomkamp envisions his birth city as a lawless metropolis where robot cops called ""scouts"" work as cost-effective but mindless enforcers.Brainiac inventor Deon (Slumdog Millionaires Dev Patel) who built the scouts for the weapons company that employs him wants to give his creations artificial intelligence on a par with human consciousness. But the corporate honcho (Sigourney Weaver) doesnt see any profit in the A.I. plan so she deep-sixes the idea. Deon also faces static from a rival robot-maker (Hugh Jackman) a former soldier who is pushing for a bigger and more lethal version of a mechanized police force.True to sci-fi cliche events unfold to manifest destiny. Deon finds a damaged scout later to be named Chappie and covertly installs his A.I. upgrade into the machine. His Dr. Frankenstein plans are rudely interrupted by street punks led by Ninja (Watkin Tudor Jones) and Yolandi (Yo-Landi Visser) real-life members of the rap-rave group Die Antwoord.Seeing Chappie as both ammunition against a rival gang and an opportunity to fleece the wealthy they kidnap both robot and inventor.Here the movie grinds almost to a halt as Blomkamp struggles to decide whether hes making a comedy or a blows-up-good action movie. Much screen time is expended on scenes where a naive and fearful Chappie is taught how to act gangsta by Ninja and Yolandi who may find themselves acquiring parental feelings despite their worst intentions.Crucial to what tiny fascination the film offers is Sharlto Copleys portrayal of rabbit-eared Chappie both as the motion-capture actor behind the computer-generated screen image and as the voice of the machine. Copley gets the movements right (although hes no Andy Serkis) but the voice badly wrong. Chappie speaks with a whiny scratchy tone that drills into the skull almost as painfully as Hans Zimmers overbearing score which I think at points must incorporate the sound of screeching TTC subway wheels.Yet for all this Chappie seems more human than any of the other actors in the film especially Weaver and Jackman who are criminally underused here.Perhaps this was part of Blomkamps devious plan all along now revealed as a thudding failure to show how machines are better than humans.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 436pm on Thursday Mar. 05 2015 Thursday Mar. 05 2015 Friday Mar. 06 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram If you cant go home again at least you can have a bit of fun trying to get there.Thats the lesson from Chappie South African director Neill Blomkamps return to his native country after the misfire that was his big Hollywood film Elysium two years ago. His 2009 debut District 9 was a sharply-drawn sci-fi metaphor about apartheid and now with the less satisfying but often entertaining Chappie hes back in his chaotic hometown of Johannesburg.This time around instead of the aliens coming from the sky they come from within us. Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) is a young engineer for Tetra Vaal a robotics company who has developed a fleet of nimble robot police who are incorruptible almost indestructible impossible to hack and deadly. Thanks to them crime is down drastically and corporate profits are up something that pleases company president Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) and angers Deons nemesis Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) a rival Tetra Vaal engineer who has come up with his own crime-fighting robot a monster called The Moose.But Deon wants more than law-enforcement glory. He wants to build a robot that can think feel and have consciousness. But Michelle believes thats a waste of time so after perfecting his program and absconding with the body of a disabled droid that had been destined for the scrap heap Deon plans to play Dr. Frankenstein on his own time and see if he can meld human and machine.What he didnt plan on was getting kidnapped by three thugs -- Ninja (Watkin Tudor Jones) Yolandi (Yolandi Visser) and an American named Yankie (Jose Pablo Cantillo The Walking Dead) -- who want him to reprogram the robot (whom Yolandi names ""Chappie"") to help them carry out heists around Joburg. These three need to raise cash fast to pay back a pumped-up gangster/warlord named Hippo (Brandon Auret).When Chappie comes to life -- a blank slate waiting to be molded -- he can either follow in Ninjas violent footsteps or heed the wisdom of his ""maker"" Deon and pursue art and knowledge for the sake of it.Its in the to-and-fro for Chappies ""soul"" that the film is at its best as the robot -- voiced by the wonderful Sharlto Copley (the star of District 9) -- tries to find his bearings in a world where people often arent what they seem and will hurt you as soon as help. Underscoring this are the captivating performances from Jones and Visser better known in music circles as the brains of the wildly quirky Die Antwoord (Afrikaans for ""The Answer"") one of South Africas most popular bands.They basically play themselves or at least the image theyve portrayed of themselves as a self-aware hip-hop hooligan (reminiscent of James Francos gangsta wannabe in Spring Breakers) and his weird sprite sidekick. (That their music along with that of composer Hans Zimmer is all over the soundtrack and they make shout-outs to their real selves on T-shirts and such throughout the movie only adds to the blurring of fiction and reality).As Moore Hippo Tetra Vaal and the Johannesburg police all come after this hastily assembled family -- Yolandi and Ninja even want Chappie to call them ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" -- the film becomes less persuasive as it devolves into explosions (and if you thought they were going to introduce The Moose and not let it blow a lot of stuff up well youd be wrong.)Until then though Chappie is a sly send-up of both contemporary South African society -- Johannesburg does have a global reputation for its violent crime -- and previous movies about artificial intelligence. Never mind that Weaver and Jackman are totally wasted or the laughable lapses in logic (why wouldnt Tetra Vaal post at least one guard in the area where its most precious robot secrets are kept?) or that it lacks the social resonance of District 9. Its a fun little ride for at least part of the way.Maybe next time Blomkamp will actually get where he wants to go.

Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Columbia Pictures Chappie (pictured above) is a police droid that is reprogrammed to think and feel for himself. Columbia Pictures Didnt we just do this? Paul Verhoevens 1987 futuristic satire RoboCop got a watery remake only a year ago. But if you took Chappie - the third trigger-happy dystopian sci-fi from Neill Blomkamp the South African cowriter amp; director of District 9 - and slapped the title RoboCop on it no one would bat an eye. The only plot points Chappie doesnt crib from that spunky Reagan-era classic are the ones it appropriates from Short Circuit a family comedy about an adorable military robot that becomes sentient and starts spouting quips learned from John Wayne movies. Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy were that films name-above-title stars just to give a temporal landmark. Replacing them in Blomkamps new film are Ninja and Yo-landi Vier - the South African rap duo Die Antwoord - playing the armed felons (""Ninja"" and ""Yolandi"" respectively) who become sociopathic-but-loving parents to a childlike droid. Short Circuits Johnny Five was one of those gentle self-aware robots inclined to tolerate humankinds failings rather than hunt us to extinction. So too is Chappie a battle-damaged ""Scout"" - a semi-autonomous humanoid-model RoboCop - whom inventor Dev Patel rescues from the junk heap so he can use it to test a little no-big-deal project hes been tinkering with in his spare artificial intelligence. (He seems to experience an epiphany while gazing at a poster of a cat wearing sunglasses.) Chappie the robot gets smart. Chappie the movie stays very very dumb. Dumb enough to believe that the CEO of a successful robotics firm (Sigourney Weaver who has never looked so glamorously bored) needs to be told what artificial intelligence is just for instance. But Blomkamp sure did get some people show up for it. No less an authority than Anderson Cooper delivers the traditional movie-opening expository newscast which tells us that the deployment of the Scouts in Johannesburg has at last begun to reduce the citys horrific violent crime rate. Hugh Jackman sporting the worst haircut of his career but only the fourth-worst in this movie is the other versatile star consigned in a one-note role. Entering with the immortal line ""I have a robot that is indestructible"" he plays a solider-turned-weapons-designer employed by the same firm that makes the Scouts. Exactly no exactly like Ronny Coxs character in RoboCop he envies the success his rival (Patel) has had with his more humane human-scale police droid and hes determined to sell the authorities on his bigger scarier ""urban pacification"" bot even if he has to gin up a bloody crime wave to do it. Jackmans design - basically a Harrier jump jet with legs - is called The Moose. (""Deploy the Moose"" is not a pickup line as used in this film.) A scene in which the police brass tell Jackman they simply cant use a piece of hardware that destructive clearly isnt meant as a caustic joke. But it sure plays like one here in the U.S. where the militarization of police forces is widely perceived to have eroded relations between cops and the communities theyre meant to serve. A smarter film wouldve found some dark humor and/or pathos in that oppressed/oppressor dynamic. (At least one smarter Johannesburg-set movie already did It was called District 9.) Chappie the rabbit-eared robot is performed by Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley in a motion-capture suit. Even though weve seen this technology used to miraculous effect in The Lord of the Rings films the recent Planet of the Apes pictures and many others the novelty of it - when paired a with a strong specific performance like Copleys - hasnt quite worn off. Scenes wherein Copleys infantile bot teaches itself to mimic the swaggering speech and gait of its rap-star foster parents or falls in love with a childrens book sound hoary; in fact theyre the best moments in this R-rated shoot-em-up by far. (Theres also a funny er carjacking montage.) Copley Ninja and Vier - not to mention Patel who urges his creation to ""Nurture your creativity Chappie"" - all rise above the lame material. And the mere sight of a battered police robot spray-painted with band logos and blinged out in flashy jewelry is a rich visual joke. Compelling imagery has never been Blomkamps problem though. All three of his features have been feasts for the eyes assuming your eyes hunger for firearms and mecha. But District 9 seemed to promise that his imagination and skill as a storyteller were just as acute as his visual genius. He had the expectation-setting chutzpah to introduce himself to the world with an original morally disorienting unexpectedly moving sci-fi action allegory that utterly nailed its fable-like finish. Its Best Picture nod was no aberration. With a liberal social conscience very publicly duking it out onscreen with a lust for high-tech death machines Blomkamp looked like the next James Cameron. But after 2013s clunky Elysium and the even less inspired Chappie hes looking more like the next M. Night Shyamalan An auteur sure - but one whose every subsequent effort feels like an increasingly faded copy of his prodigious first. Just weeks ago Blomkamp announced he will follow in Camerons footsteps by re-teaming with Weaver for an Alien movie - one that may (though Blomkamp is playing coy on this point) pick up the story after Camerons Aliens retconning away the less beloved later sequels wherein Weavers iconic heroine Ellen Ripley was killed off and then resurrected as a clone. Lets hope Blomkamp has a different trick up his leave. Cloning isnt working for him.

Youll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan March 5 2015 In ""Chappie"" a dystopian robot thriller from South African director Neill Blomkamp (""Elysium"") were introduced to an awkwardly stiff humanoid with something funny-looking sticking out of his head. And thats just Hugh Jackman who along with a ridiculous mullet plays the movies wooden one-dimensional villain. The real automaton hero -- a rabbit-eared police droid that develops artificial intelligence and a streetwise swagger after being adopted by a gang of Johannesburg thugs -- is Chappie (South African slang for ""young man""). As voiced by Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley Chappie is far more human than even his human nemesis Vincent a muscle-bound soldier-turned-robot-designer who stomps through every scene like one of his automated combat troops. In the role of a man who will stop at nothing -- including allowing the streets of Johannesburg to descend into chaos in order to create more demand for his product -- Jackman is simply painful to watch. But not as painful as it is to contemplate how naively the film treats the concept of artificial intelligence and robotics. Co-written by Blomkamp with his ""District 9"" writing partner Terri Tatchell and set in 2016 -- thats right one short year from now in a world thats gone straight to hell -- ""Chappie"" imagines a universe in which human consciousness is capable of being uploaded to a thumb drive and where the Internet that repository of everything from porn to the owners manual for the space shuttle -- is all one needs to access the entirety of human knowledge. (Never mind that last month I couldnt find a 1987 episode of ""SNL"" that I was looking for.) ""Chappie"" is a ball of contradiction. It takes the concept of ""Transcendence"" crosses it with the storyline of ""RoboCop"" and then delivers it seemingly to the target demographic of ""Short Circuit."" It is in other words simultaneously dumb hyperviolent and cutesy. Why for instance do Chappies ""eyes"" -- represented by eight-bit black-and-white computer graphics that look like the screens of an old Motorola cellphone -- narrow cartoonishly to slits when he gets ""angry""? Why does he even have eyes for that matter? Okay okay I get the anthropomorphizing. But a scene where Chappie who is made out of bullet-resistent titanium is shown getting some kind of tactile pleasure out of petting a dog is beyond illogical. Theres more pleasure to be had from watching Chappies human caretakers a couple of criminals called Yolandi and Ninja who find Chappie and try to enlist him as a partner in crime. Played by non-actors Yolandi Visser and Ninja a South African rap duo who perform as Die Antwoord (or The Answer) the antiheroic characters are the best thing about the movie despite being largely unsympathetic (i.e.theyre murderous thugs). They exude a raw appeal that if not quite charm is nonetheless highly watchable. As Deon the software engineer who wrote the computer code for Chappie Dev Patel is adequate if under-used. When hes wounded by one of Vincents walking death machines -- a remotely-operated war drone called the Moose -- the scene fails to elicit the pathos it might otherwise warrant simply because Patel is such a cipher. As for Sigourney Weaver who plays Vincent and Deons boss she turns in a performance thats almost as heavy-handed as Jackmans. Visually ""Chappie"" has the cool and expensive look of a video game. Its adrenaline-stimulating eye candy. Despite Blomkamps efforts to make some kind of commentary about the human soul which the auteur bolsters with his trademark social consciousness -- a tone of preachiness that after three films has worn out its welcome -- the movie exhibits precious little humanity. Like Chappie the movie seems human but has a cold metal heart. Chappie  1/2 (124 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence obscenity drug content and brief nudity. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"Oddly the robot is the least robotic thing about Chappie - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Oddly the robot is the least robotic thing about Chappie Scene from Chappie Sony Pictures Chappie and his maker (Dev Patel) in ""Chappie."" Chappie and his maker (Dev Patel) in ""Chappie."" (Sony Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Neill Blomkamps Chappie about a thinking feeling robot pretty much lacks those very qualities. A review ""Chappie"" is a movie about the evolution of artificial intelligence thats as dumb as a post. It also marks the continuing devolution of the work of director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp.Blomkamps first feature ""District 9"" was nominated for four Oscars including best picture because it was able to graft social concerns onto genre material. His next 2013s ""Elysium"" was less successful and now comes ""Chappie"" which is cartoonish and preposterous and not in a good way. What we have this time is the mildly futuristic story of a police robot turned by its idealistic creator into the worlds first thinking feeling piece of hardware. Its a derivative endeavor with echoes of everything from Dr. Frankensteins creation to the Tin Man in ""The Wizard of Oz"" but being unoriginal is far from its biggest problem.Bad acting isnt ""Chappies"" worst sin either though what we see is pretty dire. For one thing Blomkamp has given two key roles to a pair of fellow South Africans the rave-rap singers Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser of the group Die Antwoord. Because theyre not actors its no surprise that effective performance is beyond them but that doesnt make watching them any less painful. ""Chappie"" does have recognizable names like Dev Patel Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver in the cast and though they lack Die Antwoords excuse its safe to say theyve never given less involving performances. Its not a good sign when the most memorable character on screen is that robot (a motion capture performance by Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley) but there you have it. Video Trailer Chappie Watch the trailer for ""Chappie."" Watch the trailer for ""Chappie."" See more videos The key culprit inevitably is auteur Blomkamp who in this film favors a filmmaking style so sloppy and crude its impossible to tell if its the result of intention or ineptitude. Either way in the absence of the strong ideas that animated ""District 9"" ""Chappie"" is close to unwatchable for long stretches of time.Blomkamps work as a co-writer with Terri Tatchell didnt help his directing efforts. ""Chappies"" script manages to be both overly complicated and simplistic filled with frantic activity circling a sophomoric core.The time is the near future the place Blomkamps birthplace of Johannesburg South Africa. A crime wave of unprecedented ferocity is sweeping the city and in desperation the local constabulary goes mechanical turning to whats called ""the worlds first robotic police force."" Robots may not be human but theyre the heart and soul of many a film. Weve put together some of our favorites -- and included a few that may invite debate. These droids known as Scouts were designed by brainy twerp Deon Wilson (Patel) who works for a company called Tetravaal Robotics whose all-business CEO Michelle Bradley (Weaver) wouldnt crack a smile if someones life depended on it.Wilson has been working for years at home on an unfulfilled dream a robot that can think and feel that can write music rather than arrest miscreants. But when the all-business Bradley puts the kibosh on this notion Wilson steals a rejected droid to further experiment on.Meanwhile (there is always a ""meanwhile"" in films like this) moronic criminals find themselves desperate for more ways to steal money. Led by Ninja and Yo-Landi (the actors and the criminals share the same names) they decide they need a robot of their own and end up kidnapping both Wilson and his prototype.When the robot comes to life it has the consciousness of an infant and is susceptible like a child to being influenced by unscrupulous adults.Though the unexpectedly maternal Yo-Landi wants the best for the creature she has named (""Youre a happy chappie"" she says at one point and it is done) Ninja has no such scruples and is eager to turn Chappie into ""Robot Gangster Number One"" the better to further his nefarious schemes.As if this doesnt cause enough headaches for Wilson he has troubles at the office. An unscrupulous co-worker named Vincent Moore (Jackman worse than you can possibly imagine) has his own robot in development a big galoot of a machine named Moose and he will stop at nothing to crush Wilson and destroy Chappie.All this plays out even messier and less appealing than it sounds with all kinds of mystifying choices like pastel-colored automatic weapons and the erratic use of subtitles adding to the confusion. If ""Chappie"" accomplishes anything its to make you wish that machines could make movies. They couldnt be any shoddier than this.Twitter KennethTuran---------------------------------ChappieMPAA rating R for violence language and brief nudityRunning time 2 hoursPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Neill Blomkamp Hugh Jackman Elysium (movie) Dev Patel Read more movie reviews gt;gt; Charming Deli Man takes a hearty look at the kosher deli Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-chappie-review-20150306-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,chappie21,chappie,latimes

(Stephanie Blomkamp/sony) BY Graham Fuller NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 5 2015 256 PM Title Chappie Film Info A childlike robot is drawn into crime in South Africa. (200). R Violence language. Area theaters. ""Chappie"" is as subtle as a sledgehammer. The latest sci-fi action spectacle from ""District 9"" and ""Elysium"" director Neill Blomkamp is also sprawling bombastic deafening ugly and ultra-violent. Adolescent males and video gamers who get off on massive explosions and urban mayhem may think that sounds like bliss. More sensitive viewers should expect a migraine. Ironically the all-metal electrical hero is the sensitive sort himself. A battered police bot in a future-world-ish 2016 Johannesburg Chappie (as hes named because someone says hes a ""happy chappie"") is rescued from the scrap heap by geeky inventor-engineer Deon (Dev Patel). Against the wishes of Deons boss (Sigourney Weaver) whose company supplies robots for urban law enforcement Deon fits Chappie with enhanced artificial intelligence. So he can think and feel. He turns out to be a shy peace-loving chatterbox from the Jar-Jar Binks school of futuristic weirdos. (""District 9"" star Sharlto Copley supplies the voice and movements via motion-capture.) Deons bullying rival inventor Vincent (Hugh Jackman in a cameo essentially) fumes because he cant get enough funding to soup up his huge lumbering ""Moose"" robot operated from a helmet worn by a cop. The stage is set for an earth-shuddering face-off between Chappie and a ""Moose"" but this is hardly a clash of titans. The contest takes forever to arrive. First the convoluted plot demands that Chappie and Deon be kidnapped by a crew of hapless street criminals including Ninja and Yolandi Visser (of the South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord) playing exaggerated versions of themselves as ""Road Warrior""-esque thugs. Thinking Chappie would make a great burglar and a lethal mecha-gangster they find hes more like an Oliver Twist taught to break laws. Yolandi begins to mother him saying he can call her ""Mommy."" When Chappie finally vents his wrath its against power-mad Vincent. Jackman is mildly entertaining in a rare villain role but its not enough. Blomkamp and his wife and co-screenwriter Terri Tatchell throw in some interesting ideas like the notion of storing an individuals consciousness on a flash drive. Trouble is ""Chappie"" is an overwhelming war zone of a movie that tries to do too many things -- although encouraging thought is not among them.

It beats his movie (SONY) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 05 2015 at 431 PM comments There are two movies in ""Chappie"" and both of them are lousy. The first is a generic rip-off of the original ""RoboCop"" with a major corporation creating cyber-police to patrol a decaying city - and when a sentient one poses a problem unleashing a giant tank-sized machine to take him out. The second is an incredibly grating cacophonous mess with Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser from the South African rap group Die Antwoord as two loathsome low-life punks who steal - and then corrupt - one of those robots into becoming their partner in crime. Charmed so far? Because this particular automaton which they dub ""Chappie"" is also the most ludicrous gratuitously offensive sci-fi character since Jar Jar Binks speaking in thickly accented substandard English and bedecking himself with gold chains and spray-on tats. Really? Really? Id ask what director and cowriter Neil Blomkamp was thinking but I can safely guess Hes thinking it was some sort of brilliant social commentary just the way his overpraised ""District 9"" commented on racial politics (only 25 years or so after ""Alien Nation"" did it better) and ""Elysium"" hysterically criticized the costs of medical care. Give Blomkamp a sledgehammer and hell give you an editorial. Except whatever he thinks he might be saying sociologically - there are no bad robots only bad influences - is lost under the shouting and extraordinarily bad acting beginning with the insufferable Ninja and Visser and ending with as Chappie Sharlto Copley. Ninja and Visser at least have other careers to return to. But can someone please point Copley toward one? Copley may be Blomkamps best and oldest friend but he was awful in ""District 9"" and - as his confidence has grown in films from ""Elysium"" to ""Maleficent"" to Spike Lees ""Oldboy"" remake - hes just gotten worse. And louder. There are some nice special-effects here and great production design but Blomkamp forgot to give us any characters to latch onto. The ever-excruciating Dev Patel is the ""good"" engineer (we can tell this because he has a couple of cutesy ""Short Circuit"" style robots at home); Hugh Jackman complete with awful haircut is the ""bad"" engineer (he used to be in the Army and crosses himself before he does something really heinous). Yeah the old sledgehammer gets quite a workout here. True Blomkamp hit once with ""District 9"" but not for the films subtlety or even originality; it was because the effects were cheap and looked great. ""I Am an Artist"" is a lovely banner to march under but ""And I Put Every Dollar on Screen"" is the one moguls read. Which is why Blomkamps next assignment is a totally unnecessary ""Alien"" sequel. As long as whoever Copley plays gets killed in the first 10 minutes Im going to try to reserve judgment. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Chappie (R) Sony (120 min.)

He injected a powerful social conscience into a sci-fi tale of an alien invasion then delivered Elysium in 2013 an enthralling tale set in the near future that explored immigration but felt half-baked.Also set a few years from now Chappie has a lot on its mind. But some ideas go astray. Others gets obscured in elaborate action scenes. Potential goes unfulfilled.The best thingis the title character a sentient robot voiced and performed via motion capture byDistrict 9 star Sharlto Copley.Before audiences meet Chappie they are introduced to legions of robo-cops who patrol Johannesburg. These autonomous droids are known as Scouts and are under the command of human officers. Crime has dropped significantly since the Scouts joined the force.Sigourney Weaver plays Michelle the CEO of the corporation that creates the police droids. One of her employees is the militaristic Vincent (Hugh Jackman in the worst mullet since Billy Ray Cyrus).Vincent is gung-ho to release ""Moose"" a hulking robot that will not only crush lawbreakers but launch full-scale war.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A police droid is stolen given new programming and becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself. VPCDeon (Dev Patel) is an idealistic engineer obsessed with developing a thinking feeling robot. After much experimentation he succeeds in creating Chappie a sentient machine complete with a full range of human characteristics and more of a moral compass than the humans around him.This machine is stolen by underworld thugs who think hes merely a police droid not realizing they have taken an innocent child of sorts.A pair of South African rappers unconvincingly play gangsters Yo-landi and Ninja (those also are their rap names). Theyre joined by their accomplice Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo). Ninja and Amerika plan to use Chappie to help them with a deadly heist. The concept is undeniably compelling but portions of this dystopian action thriller begin to feel like a video game.Copleys Chappie is endearing poignant and admirable. However Blomkamp has loaded the film with caricatures particularly the villainous sorts.Chappies thuggish captors try to teach him to be a low-life but Deon urges him to be creative and ethical. Watching Chappie go from what is essentially infancy to adolescence is fascinating. Though impressionable he is innocent despite being reared in seedy criminal environs. He brings out the maternal nature in Yo-landi almost overnight which is hard to buy. But we do believe in Chappie. As he struggles to do the right thing hes on his way to becoming wiser than humans.The film raises issues of nature vs. nurture as much as it explores the notion of artificial intelligence. It also delves into the human inclination to manipulate and corrupt innocents.As Blomkamp melds big ideas with breathtaking action the forces are sometimes at cross purposes. Scenes of thugs gone wild are extreme and almost silly. Drawn-out violent sequences grow wearying.Chappie is at its best as a character study. The titular character is the most endearing robot since WALLE. Where that animated film made a dramatic social statement Chappie gets mired in too many menacing subplots with cartoonish bad guys. 45 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1G3bh5Q",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/03/05/chappie-review/24360105/,200,chappie24,chappie,usatoday

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Fashionably grim futures. Visceral firefights in war-torn ghettoes. High concepts that devolve into low spectacle. Theres no mistaking the handiwork of South African ""visionary"" Neill Blomkamp who builds films that are distinctly his own--heavy-handed in their metaphoric messages fetishistic in their deployment of military hardware--from the scraps and spare parts of ones that are not. But if anonymity is the enemy of artistry is there also such a thing as being too much yourself? Blomkamp an action junkie careening clumsily through the arena of cerebral sci-fi should sue himself for plagiarism. His latest Chappie was originally described as a change-of-pace ""comedy thing"" for the writer-director. Perhaps the word Blomkamp was actually searching for was ""self-parody."" Like Elysium this rusty A.I. story is basically just District 9 with a new coat of paint; its distinguished only by the jabbering irritating personality of its title character.Set in 2016 when gang culture will apparently start taking its fashion cues from Tank Girl Chappie transports audiences to a Johannesburg not much different from the one they visited in District 9. (Blomkamp even introduces the world in the same way with a mockumentary framing device that he again abandons almost immediately.) Instead of CGI space bugs the citys slums are invaded by CGI androids--a sleek line of fully automated officers with Etch A Sketch faces and adorable metal bunny ears. One of their programmers Deon (Dev Patel doing multiplex double duty this week) would rather chase the secret to sentience than build ""robot pigs."" So after cracking the consciousness code he grants a damaged droid the gift/curse of true artificial intelligence. Unfortunately his impressionable machine quickly ends up in the hands of gangsters (two of the three played flamboyantly by the South African rap duo Die Antwoord or Yo-Landi Visser and Ninja) who dub him Chappie and begin teaching him how to talk trash walk cool and handle weapons.Brought to life through what the filmmakers have described as a ""poor mans motion capture"" Chappie is a marvelous special effect at once entirely lifelike in his movements and totally credible as an assembly-line product. (Blomkamp is nothing if not a master of cosmetic design.) As a character the bot is more off-putting--a childlike idiot savant prone to fits of rage and voiced with a cloying singsong accent by Blomkamps leading man of choice Sharlto Copley. There is a certain integrity to his mechanized angst More parenting parable than treatise on the nature of consciousness Chappie presents Chappie as a product of his environment indoctrinated into the spiritual beliefs of his ""mother"" (Visser) and discouraged from playing with dolls or painting by his macho ""father"" (Ninja) with Deon as the absentee ""real"" parent to be rebelled against. Is the film equating growing minds to hackable software susceptible to the human errors of their programmers/guardians?As with his last two features Blomkamp flirts with big ideas but loses interest in them when the loud toys come out. Structurally Chappie follows the same model as its predecessors putting a hunted hero in the crosshairs of competing parties over a compressed period of time. There is again a bellowing lowlife kingpin to be violently eliminated and an icy company woman a la Jodie Fosters oddly accented Elysium heavy. (The bigwig is played this time by Sigourney Weaver who seems to have found a second career as a cameo accessory strengthening the sci-fi bona fides of various projects simply by reminding audiences of the Alien series.) The most substantial of the villains is a bitter rival engineer (Hugh Jackman) whose remote-controlled robot The Moose is a dead ringer for the ED-209 from Robocop. The constant nods to that genre classic only make one long for the satirical wonders Paul Verhoeven might have worked with this material.Blomkamp climaxes his movie the only way he knows how with a hail of gunfire a splattering of bodies and a feverish chase from arid warzones to sterile corporate interiors. More of his pet obsessions pop up in the backstretch when a transformation into The Other again rears its head and a character pulls a feat of deus ex machina coding even more absurd than the one in Elysium. All of the filmmakers strengths and weaknesses are on full display; he remains a wizard at world building while getting stuck again on the learning curve of actual storytelling. Those not fazed by the diminishing returns of Elysium may continue to be unfazed as the returns diminish further here though even the diehards may struggle to warm to the slang-slinging mascot hero of this District 11. Bring on the Alien sequel already. At best it may force Blomkamp to finally rewrite his own programming. Plus you know hell have a ball with the Caterpillar P-5000.

EntertainmentMovies Chappie Tale of childlike robocop does not compute Originally published March 5 2015 at 933 am Updated March 5 2015 at 105 pm ""Chappie"" (Sharlto Copley) and his maker (Dev Patel). (Courtesy of Columbia Pictures) A movie review of ""Chappie"" Neill Blomkamps latest sci-fi picture is a big dumb blockbuster about robot cops thats indistinguishable from so many others that roll off the Hollywood assembly line. Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times When Neill Blomkamps ""District 9"" came out in 2009 it was instantly apparent it was a work of tremendous originality. His direction was so assured and his creation of a future world so uniquely imagined that it was a shock to learn that it was his first feature. Where one wondered did this guy come from? With Blomkamps latest ""Chappie"" the question now is Where has that guy gone to? The setting is the same Johannesburg Blomkamps hometown. The core creative team is the same Blomkamp and his co-screenwriter (and wife) Terri Tatchell. And ""District 9s"" star Sharlto Copley is back in the title role though transformed into a robot through the miracle of motion-capture technology. Movie Review 1/2   Chappie with Sharlto Copley Dev Patel Ninja Yo-Landi Visser Sigourney Weaver Hugh Jackman. Directed by Neill Blomkamp from a screenplay by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell. 124 minutes. Rated R for violence language and brief nudity. Several theaters. But of the originality that characterized that first picture barely a trace remains.

VIEWSeaTac ordered to pay 18 million to couple it cheated in secret land grabUnlimited Digital Access. 1 for 4 weeks.What we have here basically is ""RoboCop"" redux. Robot cops are the wave of the future of law enforcement. Chappie badly blown up in a raid gone wrong is reclaimed and reprogrammed by a genius cyberengineer Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) who aims to make Chappie a thinking entity with humanlike emotions. This doesnt sit too well with rival engineer Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) who like Ronnie Coxs character in the original ""RoboCop"" does everything in his power to sabotage Deon and his creation and promote a monstrous clanking cop bot Moore designed. The villains sporting mondo bizarro hairstyles look like ""Mad Max"" berserkers. And then theres Chappie a childlike innocent reminiscent of the sweet-natured robot Robin Williams played in 1999s ""Bicentennial Man."" Chappies instruction in human behavior falls to a couple of gangsters (Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser). They kidnap Deon and Chappie and then Ninjas character schools him in the thug life teaching him gangsta slang and draping him in bling. The maternal instincts of Vissers character are stirred by the childish bot and it isnt long before shes reading him bedtime stories and informing him of the nature of his soul. And every now and then to liven things up massive megaviolence breaks out. So ""Chappie"" sadly is a giant step backward for this once promising filmmaker a big dumb blockbuster thats indistinguishable from so many others that roll off the Hollywood assembly line.

His life his story will change the way the world looks at robots and humans forever. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint After his superb feature debut with ""District 9"" South Africas Neill Blomkamp was hailed as science fictions dystopian savior the visionary who could combine Orwellian political themes with breathtaking action. But after leaving many viewers feeling burned with ""Elysium"" his third film will char them to cinders. ""Chappie"" is sappy. Theres a better rhyme but its not a word used in family newspapers. Set in a future only months away ""Chappie"" imagines that Johannesburgs violent gang problems have been passed on to an army of robocops. The new creations resembling tall trim titanium athletes police the daily mayhem with criminally lethal efficiency. Their internal programming frees them from the direct human guidance that had powered their bigger clunkier predecessors. To Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) their corporate manufacturers lead designer that characteristic makes the new variety a morally promising breed. He hopes to connect them to an artificial intelligence that can make them smarter and more ethical than humans. Deons competitive rival engineer Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) resents the way the new robots are sucking financial resources from his older battlebots. A military vet with conservative religious dogmas he thinks humans should remain the bots godlike controllers. With his mullet haircut repeated signs of the crucifix and office wear of khaki shorts hes clearly a troublemaker. Sigourney Weaver appearing briefly as their profit-focused corporate overlord has little more than a walk-on. The engineers competition jumps a level when a model Deon is trying to build in secret is grabbed by second-rate gangstas Ninja and Yo-Landi (played by South Africas hip-hop duo Die Antwoord). In order to pay off a far tougher crime boss who threatens to kill them unless they deliver millions within a week the pair try to teach Chappie as Yo-Landi names him their view of the world largely consisting of trash talk and gunfire. However Chappie changes them more than they educate him. He brings out fond parental impulses. Vincent meanwhile sets out to find the missing robot and crush Deons career. Columbia Pictures Dev Patel with his sentient robo-cop creation ""Chappie."" As baby-talking Chappie matures in a matter of days the story becomes a misfired mixture of Pinocchio and Jar Jar Binks. ""Chappie"" once again shows Blomkamps incredible lush visual imagination and his far smaller story sense. There is not a shot lacking fascinating design or documentary-style energy. From the tormented circus of Johannesburgs rotting buildings to the many body-blasting mob battles or Chappies slapstick approach to fisticuffs the film is beautifully composed and endlessly watchable. But alongside its cinematic realism is stylized fantasy thats utterly careless. Blomkamps regular star Sharlto Copley portrays the computer-generated Chappie with the sort of motion-capture performance that has given Andy Serkis lifetime employment in Peter Jacksons Hobbit epics. But the character is an unlikable figure of satire entirely devoid of humor. None of the characters go beyond a single dimension. Thats understandable when the films actual stars are a couple of non-acting rap stars but with dynamos like Jackman Patel and Weaver in half-developed roles its a wearying waste of time. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

For example Could Harrison Fords President James Marshall schedule a White House screening of Raiders of the Lost Ark? If Madonnas character in Swept Away turned on the radio and ""La Isla Bonita"" came on what would she hear? There will never be definitive answers to these questions and they mostly make for fun party conversation but they are particularly useful to keep the brain active during movies as dull as Chappie. The latest sci-fi allegory from District 9 and Elysium director Neill Blomkamp takes place in a not-too-distant future where the crime rate in Johannesburg has plummeted thanks to an indestructible robot police force designed by Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) and overseen by weapons company CEO Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver). The robots--or scouts as theyre called--have a relatively evolved level of artificial intelligence but Deon believes he has developed the programming for another huge evolutionary step a cyber brain that can learn reason and appreciate art in the same way a humans can. He swipes a bot otherwise relegated to the scrap heap but is intercepted by thugs Ninja and Yolandi played by the two members of South African hip-hop collective Die Antwoord (well discuss them in a minute). They name the new creation Chappie (voiced by Sharlto Copley) teach him how to be a cartoonish gangbanger and plan to use him to execute a big money heist while Deon struggles to take his creation back. What follows is an hour of a reasonable-enough meditation on parenting styles followed by an inevitable series of too-loud action beats sparked by Deons rival engineer Vincent (Hugh Jackman just inhaling scenery) and a ridiculous series of events involving the full download of human consciousness. But heres the thing that absolutely eclipses anything else going on in Chappie The two gangster characters are named Ninja and Yolandi but when those two humans perform as Die Antwoord they also use the names Ninja and Yolandi. The pair also wear their own merchandise during most of the movie sporting T-shirts that have their own names and images on them. Several Die Antwoord songs appear on the soundtrack. So are we to believe that these are the actual members of Die Antwoord who in this not-that-far-off dystopia have given up on having a music career and now run drugs out of an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Johannesburg? Did the performers use the same names out of fear that they as non-actors would not be able to remember a second batch of fake names? Does Die Antwoords music exist in this universe and if so wouldnt it be pretty easy for the police to identify and catch them? When crime boss Hippo (Blomkamp regular Brandon Auret) first started doing business with them did he say ""Hey didnt you guys have kind of a big viral hit with I Find U Freeky a couple of years back?"" Or does the music exist but was created by two other people named Ninja and Yolandi? Are ""Ninja"" and ""Yolandi"" pretty common names in South Africa? The mind reels. Those questions are all that Ninja and Yolandi bring to the table as their performances could be described as distracting at best and disastrous at worst. Patel doesnt fare much better--his character is so earnestly hellbent on trying to nurture Chappie by reading him stories and teaching him to paint that he comes across as something of a goofball lunatic and not a brilliant scientist. Chappie himself is lovingly and realistically rendered though his personality shifts so often and so fast that its hard to know how we should feel about him. When were first introduced hes an overwhelmed infant and by the time the credits roll hes John McClane. Is that an accurate representation of how artificial intelligence can evolve? Absolutely. Does it make for compelling drama? Not particularly. There are a lot of ideas kicking around in Chappie the nature/nurture debate the validity of various approaches to parenting the moral and ethical questions surrounding artificial intelligence the very nature of sentience and consciousness. But none of those ideas are explored enough and its hard to figure out how those philosophical inquiries fit into a climax with Jackman trying to murder everybody via an ED-209 clone. At least youll have the Die Antwoord Conundrum to distract you.

He did it to lesser effect in 2013s Elysium. Now in Chappie Blomkamp -- again drawing on the apartheid and xenophobia of his heritage -- creates a futuristic world that goes haywire when man creates a robot in his image. Sadly Blomkamps ideas feel depleted this time dulled by repetition and other cinematic droids that stretch from HAL 9000 in 2001 A Space Odyssey to Ultron in the upcoming sequel to The Avengers.

Comments click to enlarge Chappie Video Rated R  120 minutes  2015 In the not-too-distant future a robotic police force serves and protects dystopian Johannesburg but the ambitious engineer who designed them (Dev Patel) aspires to create a completely sentient model. When he succeeds the impressionable droid falls prey to various interlopers including some exploitive gangsters (played by rap group Die Antwoord) and a rival engineer who wants it destroyed (Hugh Jackman). This doesnt have many original ideas though I had fun picking out all the references to other SF movies (RoboCop Westworld and The Terminator to name a few). Like director Neill Blomkamps previous features (District 9 Elysium) the film suffers from pretentious allegory and half-baked social commentary its familiar themes easily traced back to Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov. The special effects are incredible (especially given the relatively small budget) but the flat digital cinematography renders even the most technically impressive action sequence visually stale.

The complicated story about Artificial Intelligence and a sentient robot puts forward an uneasy mix of action and philosophy with simplistic notions of good and evil and mother love proving to be a distraction from the main event. The film has a kick-ass start. Chappie transports a viewer to Johannesburg in the near future where robots are employed in the police force. Fearless and (almost) indestructible the robots battle the bad guys and that involves moments of gripping action shot from the machines point of view. One robot 22 gets damaged often enough to be ready for the dustbin. At the same time conflict arises between Deon (Dev Patel) the engineer who helped create the police robots and his co-worker Vincent (Hugh Jackman) a weapons expert. Deon is keen to push the A. I. envelope with the robots and experiment with creating consciousness; Vincent is both jealous of Deons success and obsessively opposed to his ideas -- those experiments with consciousness are a form of playing God. And despite being a bit of a religious fanatic Vincent would love an excuse to unleash the hulking military droid he invented. The head of the weapons company (Sigourney Weaver) has to curtail both Vincents rage and Deons A.I. experiments. Mobile users please click here. That little damaged robot however is too much temptation for Deon. He steals the metal hulk before it can be recycled in order to continue his A. I. experiments. Hes successful too but then he and the robot are waylaid by a local criminal element (played by Ninja and Yolandi Visser of the rap-rave group Die Antwoord). The baddies want the little robot to help out with their crimes. Deon wants the robot who calls himself Chappie to evolve into a good being. Chappie develops in the same way a child would which takes the story into new territory some of it comedic. Yolandi becomes a mother figure to Chappie while the cruel Ninja teaches the robot to steal. Once he has developed consciousness to a certain point Chappie has some hard questions for his creator Deon involving life and death. Various spiritual notions crop up in the story and not in a subtle fashion. As the story builds toward a huge showdown between good and evil Chappie moves into what you might call Transcendence territory. Chappie goes off the rails after about the first hour mostly because there are more ideas floating around than one movie can hold. The narrative is all over the place. There are moments when a viewer is completely out of the movie (the whole Die Antwoord presence is off-putting) and some of the characters are underdeveloped and underused; Blomkamp does better with machines than people. Certainly the special effects are very cool. Chappie himself is fantastic and completely believable. The little-robot-who-could is a combination of Sharlto Copleys performance capture work and visual effects artistry and the end result is remarkable. That may well be enough for Blomkamp fans but anyone else can expect to be disappointed by Chappie.

"Chappie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Zero stars for Chappie Chappie Columbia Pictures Scene from ""Chappie."" Scene from ""Chappie."" (Columbia Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune To the crushing machine I found lots to admire in writer-director Neill Blomkamps ""District 9"" and despite its heavy-handed universal health care polemics the Matt Damon space station allegory ""Elysium."" But his latest science fiction outing co-written (like ""Elysium"") with his wife Terri Tatchell is a misjudgment from metallic head to titanium toe. After Wednesdays advance screening the dialogue en route to the parking garage was clear and pointed. Woman 1 ""Wasnt that the worst?"" Woman 2 ""The worst. Could you hit P2 please?""Were in Johannesburg South Africa (Blomkamps home town) in the near future. Robotic law enforcement droids (a la ""RoboCop"") have improved crime statistics. The towns gang activity is on the run. The police force orders up another batch of robots from the weapons firm run by Sigourney Weaver (who may end up working with Blomkamp on a rumored ""Alien"" reboot). The firms lead designer (Dev Patel) cracks the code for a new iteration of droid one that is fully empathically human in its techno-makeup. Meantime the designers colleague and seething rival (Hugh Jackman looking a bit lost) continues to press for funding on a sinister mega-flying-destructo droid. Eventually this puts Jackman here sporting a mullet David Spade might envy back in virtual-reality ""Real Steel"" territory.The ""Mad Max"" criminals (mugged to the hilt by South African rappers Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser) kidnap Patels character in hopes of enlisting his inventions in a multimillion dollar heist. The sweet naive droid the punks nickname Chappie becomes a pawn in their miserable game and the center of the movies questions among them Can a movie profitably recall ""RoboCop"" and ""Short Circuit"" and the recent Johnny Depp snooze ""Transcendence"" and the holy grail of dubious influences Jar Jar Binks of ""Star Wars"" infamy? As voiced by Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley Chappie is a whining mewling dithering nattering bore. The film heaps humiliation insult and physical injury onto this character throughout a very long two hours. Dark or light sentimental or hard-edged science fiction is usually better off not piling on and watching Chappies adversaries buzz saw one of his limbs off or light him on fire or turn him into a bling-laden gangsta for laughs well ... the mood swings are psychotic and the entertainment value is off the charts in the wrong direction. Latest movies reviewedOpen link This is one of those misjudgments that could only have come from a talented filmmaker with an idea ripped off from ""A.I."" and a million other movies seen through to the bitter end. Blomkamp uses his titular creation inspired by short films the director made prior to ""District 9"" to prod the audience into thinking about mans inhumanity to man and the ethical ramifications of artistic intelligence. Yet the rooting interests in ""Chappie"" such as they arent remain hopelessly conflicted so that you care for nobodys survival least of all the ""Wall-E"" knock-off. Already the film has its defenders who appreciate Blomkamps willingness to juggle tones and intentions. But the pathos just feels icky and wrong and I think ""Chappie"" is misspelled; somebody threw in an ""h"" where the ""r"" belongs.""Chappie"" - Zero starsMPAA rating R (for violence language and brief nudity)Running time 202Opens Thursday eveningmjphillipstribpub.com Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Neill Blomkamp Reviews Hugh Jackman Sharlto Copley Dev Patel Review Maps to the Stars Review The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising71deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-chappie-review-20150305-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,chappie33,chappie,chicagotribune

Photo Stephanie Blomkamp / Stephanie Blomkamp / Columbia Pictures Chappie review sci-fi action with a soul 1 / 5 Back to Gallery To see ""Chappie"" is to feel as if youre looking inside a mind infested by everything wrong with todays movies. Writer-director Neill Blomkamp (""District 9"") is in love with action. Hes in love with CGI characters computers in general and the dystopian future that is always two or three or five years away and always horrible. Yet ""Chappie"" is invested with such humanity such a seemingly effortless delicacy of feeling that it makes one suspect that even if movies continue in this machine direction theyll never fully give way to machines. When you get to the level of art theres a human strain thats irreducible that has to be there or else theres nothing. And Blomkamp is definitely an artist. Its hard to say how much hes doing consciously and how much hes doing through intuition but hes doing really interesting things in ""Chappie"" and right from the beginning. For example he starts the movie with the soundtrack as a heavy presence as he introduces various plot elements. Its as if everything youre seeing is part of some overarching symphony of meaning. But then once hes grounded us in his world he eases up on the music and the characters become specific no longer emblematic. Soon were embroiled in the struggles of three sets of characters. Theres Dev Patel as Deon a scientist working in the field of artificial intelligence. Specifically he is working for a company that is providing the city of Johannesburg with a robotic police force but in his off hours he has come up with a way to give robots consciousness. Then theres Ninja and Yolandi played by the South African rappers Ninja and Yo-landi Visser respectively. The two want to pull off a big heist but the mechanical cops are an insurmountable obstacle. So they get the idea of kidnapping Deon the chief engineer figuring he can devise a way to switch the robots off. And finally theres Hugh Jackman as a rival robot maker consumed with jealousy and frustration at what Deon has achieved. The character of Chappie enters the picture when the kidnapped Deon brings him to life at Ninja and Yolandis hideout. Unlike the usual robot he comes into the world with the mind of a child knowing nothing but with an infinite capacity to learn quickly. The movie becomes at one level a struggle for Chappies soul between the good parent Deon and the bad parent Ninja with Yo-landi as the surprisingly affectionate mother figure somewhere in the middle. This is probably as good a place as any to say that Yo-landi in her feature debut is a real find with a childlike voice and appearance but with a whole atmosphere of corruption about her. Imagine Giulietta Masina from the Fellini films only alarming and futuristic. Most of ""Chappie"" involves Ninjas efforts to push the naive and pliable Chappie into crime and Deons to move him toward good. One of the films marvels is how well Chappie is developed as an endearing character. Hes a digital creation but Sharlto Copley in a motion-capture suit created his movements and also gave him a voice. Theres something alive here -- about childhood about coming into the world innocent about parenting about unconditional love ... ""Chappie"" has an unconscious life to it. Unlike most modern sci-fi films which deal entirely in external movements theres an internal quality about this. Theres a tangle of feelings impulses and ideas at work here that cant completely be untied or explained but that identifies the story as something coming from a real place within the filmmaker a place beyond intention. Indeed the fact that you cant quite say exactly what ""Chappie"" means but you know and feel that it means something tells you that its operating on a level beyond consciousness. Its what makes it a work of art. So its fitting that even on a plot level Blomkamp is too smart to settle for pat answers. For example if Chappie is virtuous then he shouldnt be a criminal but Blomkamp doesnt go the other way and say he should be a robot policeman. Hes operating from a broader and more humane point of view. And its a good sci-fi action movie too. Far be it from me to give this movie the kiss of death by making it seem too serious for its core audience. ""Chappie"" is everything it has to be -- but its everything it should be too.

The latest sci-fi film from South African director Neill Blomkamp (""District 9"") imagines a near future in which crime is out of control -- until a robotic police force comes online greatly reducing the crime rate in formerly chaotic Johannesburg. The robots are the brainchild of Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) an engineer who longs for something more artificial intelligence a sentient robot that can think for itself read books create art that sort of thing.But his boss Michelle (Sigourney Weaver) is only interested in their killing capacity so she turns down Deons request to work more on the idea. But come on what genius has ever listened to people who say no?Meanwhile looking literally over Deons shoulder from a cubicle behind him is Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) a fellow engineer whose jealousy is as ugly as his mullet. Vincent has come up with his own crime-fighting creation the Moose an ungainly contraption that looks like it wandered off the set of ""RoboCop"" and is Vincent reminds everyone controlled by a human pilot. But Michelle happy with Deons robots wont let Vincent proceed with his project.(Wait a second. Deon doesnt even get an office for discovering the technology thats saving the world?)Deon sneaks out the remains of a destroyed robot and cracks the code on how to make it think. But before he can bring it online Deon is kidnapped by nitwit thugs Ninja and Yolandi (played by Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser of the South African rap-rave duo Die Antwoord) and their cohort Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo).They think Deon controls the cop robots with a TV remote or something and theyre irate when they discover that he doesnt. But they find the robot Deon sneaked out and force him to repair it. Deon cant help himself so he does bringing it to life as a kind of blank slate -- like a baby that can learn at an exponential rate.The goons kick Deon out of their compound (although for some reason they later allow him to come and go as he pleases) and begin raising the robot which Yolandi calls Chappie in their own low-rent image. (Chappie calls Ninja ""Daddy"" and Yolandi ""Mommy"" which is both an obvious clue as to the role they play in each others lives and a scary thought.)They envision Chappie as a kind of super criminal -- ""Robot Gangster No. 1"" -- and deck him out in gold chains and other bling while teaching him gangster slang. Thats easy enough but they have a more difficult time persuading Chappie to break his promise to Deon that he wont hurt humans.The rest of the movie plays out then as a struggle for Chappies soul such as it is. Developments become increasingly implausible even for the world Blomkamp has created. Jackman grows increasingly cartoonish Weaver is wasted and Patel just sort of exists typing furiously on a laptop every now and then to let us know hes doing something.However Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley is quite good -- as Chappie in a motion-capture performance. (He also provides the voice of the robot.)If this were somehow a commentary on mans increasing lack of humanity or something that would be fine. Instead its just good work buried inside a movie made up of intriguing ideas that never really go anywhere.Chappie2.5 stars (out of 5) Director Neill Blomkamp.Cast Sharlto Copley Dev Patel Hugh Jackman.Rating R for violence language and brief nudity.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

So its a huge relief to discover that with Chappie the South African filmmaker has re-engaged his emotion chip and ramped up the weirdness factor for this lovably scattergun cybernetic satire. Were in near-future Johannesburg where a platoon of faceless android crimefighters have begun the mammoth task of cleaning up the streets. But their inventor (Dev Patel) has greater ambitions hes working on the worlds first true artificial intelligence a computer that can not only think but create. The result is Chappie a creature with the body of a killer but the mind of a child. And when Chappie falls into the hands of wannabe gangsters Ninja and Yolandi - played roughly as themselves by Afrikaans electroclash duo Die Antwoord - his future is thrown wide open. Will he become a benefit to humanity? Or a menace to society? It would have been easy for Blomkamp to use Chappie as a cipher a metal shell to be filled with symbolic notions of nature versus nurture corporate greed and post-human existential angst. But thanks to a wonderful vocal performance from Sharlto Copley this droid is so much more hes adorable sympathetic and even relatable a lost soul in a harsh world. Chappie the film isnt so perfect. The plot is threadbare the nods to RoboCop are laid on thick and its hard to overlook the fact that Blomkamp has made another Joburg-based movie strangely lacking in black characters. But with its stunning urban landscapes trash-talking titanium hero and mulleted God-bothering bad guy (Hugh Jackman never better) this hugely entertaining oddity could never be mistaken for the work of any other filmmaker.

The story was all over the map and could not decide if it was trying to appeal to young kids or wanted the adult audience. The rogue guys just seemed content to play 1 dimensional pantomime gangster whereas Yo-Landi did better by not trying to over act.  The film had its moments but I welt i had walked into  kids movie most of the time peppered with expletives to talk big. Sadly underwhelmed.  Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 7 2015Justin BFeaturedDistrict 9 was a superb film because it did not dilute its plot narrative or impact. Elysium was great but was slightly watered down and faltered with plot holes. Unfortunately for all its charm and wonderful charisma Chappie suffers the same fate. The premise is wonderful the robot adorable and hilarious. There are some genuine moments of depth and humour here but unfortunately it sort of all falls apart. Instead of what could have been a fantastic film we are given something that has unique stylisation but is simply entertaining and nowhere near as challenging as District 9.

"Chappie Review Hugh Jackman and Dev Patel Caught in Robotics vs. Ethics Battle - TheWrap body{-webkit-animationnone;-moz-animationnone;-ms-animationnone;animationnone} TheWrap Chappie Review Hugh Jackman and Dev Patel Caught in Robotics vs. Ethics Battle Movies | By    James Rocchi on March 4 2015  900 am Follow mmmtravis With his third film ""Chappie"" South African-born filmmaker Neill Blomkamp has honed the double-edged sword of his career to a sharp and gleaming edge that wounds his own film. Its easy to be carried away by the kineticism and the filmmaking in ""Chappie"" as robots and humans engage in pitched gun battles between themselves and each other. Its also easy to recognize that Blomkamps films each set in near-future riffs on our own society now represent a groove that is stuck in a rut. See photos District 9 Director Neill Blomkamp Shares Concept Art for Aborted Alien Sequel (Photos) Following ""District 9"" and ""Elysium"" ""Chappie"" continues Blomkamps trend of telling effects-heavy stories about dispossessed underdogs set up to challenge a high-tech corporate state; a box set of these films could accurately and easily be summarized with the title ""Fight the Power (in a Motion-Capture Suit)."" While its certainly nice to see a genre filmmaker engage with social concerns its also worth asking if Blomkamp has literally anything else on his mind to share with the audience. See Video Hugh Jackman Thinks Artificial Intelligence Is Bad News in First Chappie Trailer (Video) Set in 2016 the film shows the police in Johannesburg South Africa using autonomous humanoid robot drone police units to help keep the peace in a violent city. After a tough day on the job Unit 22 is damaged severely; the designer who wrote the code for the robots Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) is working off-the-books on artificial intelligence and appropriates the busted-and abandoned Unit 22 as the shell for his A.I. program to see if his breakthrough will work. At the same time fellow robot-maker Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) is trying to get more funding for his crime-fighting machine a larger and more heavily-armed robot under direct human control called the Moose. And bringing together the third strand of the plot a team of street criminals led by Ninja and Yo-Landi (played by musicians Ninja and Y=yo-Landi Vier of the South African rap group Die Antwoord) kidnap Wilson to see if he can shut off the cop drones with his insider knowledge so that they can commit a life-saving heist with reduced police interference. They acquire Wilsons newly self-aware Unit 22 in the bargain; hes soon named ""Chappie"" played by Blomkamp stalwart Sharlto Copley through the magic of motion-capture. Also Read The Newsroom Exit Interview Dev Patel Is a Handful Sam Waterston Cant Park Written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell ""Chappie"" seems like a 2015 riff on several philosophical ideas and plot elements in Paul Verhoevens 1987 ""RoboCop"" with a judicious amount of gold-toothed faux-""thuggery"" sprinkled about like withered parsley on reheated leftovers. Chappie absorbing everything he is told by Ninja and Yo-Landi is soon spouting phrases like ""Chappie indestructible robot gangster number one"" -- marking shades of the robot from the ""Short Circuit"" movies -- with a faulty battery limiting his lifespan so he can shout existential questions like ""Youre my maker; why did you make me so I could die?"" Blomkamp (alongside production designer Jules Cook) creates 2016 Johannesburg as an apocalypse by way of Banksy with graffiti strewn on crumbling buildings as pitched gun battles break out in the streets. Also Read Sigourney Weaver Will Be Back for Avatar Sequels As a Different Character Its easy to understand Blomkamps concerns in his three films; growing up under Apartheid would be enough to make any person interested in how systems made by human beings come to define other humans (and other beings) as less than human. The question is if Blomkamp has any other stories to tell than sci-fi have-nots vs. sci-fi haves. (Blomkamp is about to tackle a new ""Alien"" film for Fox nearly 20 years after Sigourney Weaver and most fans finished with the series delighting both 20th Century Fox shareholders and 20th Century Fox shareholders.) Also Read Sharlto Copley Gets Hardcore in Teaser For First-Person Action Movie (Video) As for the cast Patel Jackman and Weaver are fine in roles as machine-made as any robot Respectively the scientific idealist the violent pragmatist the cold-blooded CEO. But Blomkamps decision to cast musicians Ninja and Vier in their roles is confounding. The two are visually striking to be sure Vier has a haircut that suggests she doesnt own a mirror while Ninja has tattoos with the kind of profane profusion and placement that suggests no capability for long-term thinking. But dramatically theyre both inert giving dead line readings or unmodulated shouting -- and worse its hard to not be reminded that Vier and Ninja are not street criminals but rather members of the band Die Antwoord when they keep on wearing clothing with the name of their band on it not once but multiple times. Its a failure in basic filmmaking and artistic judgment on the order of Clint Eastwoods rubber ""American Sniper"" prop baby. Blomkamp earned his name on his first film for wringing mega-effects out of a minimal budget and he does the same here pushing every bit of his increased resources to the breaking point with the help of WETAs techs and artisans. And yet all of the visual rapture in the film -- the unleashing of the Moose the way Chappies movements become more and more human -- cant replace the numbing sensation that comes as ""Chappie"" recycles and riffs on ""District 9"" and ""Elysium"" from its opening credits to its hackneyed final shot. Throughout this film youll be told repeatedly in whispers and shouts that the now self-aware Chappie has feelings. Its too bad that neither the philosophy nor the pyrotechnics on-screen in ""Chappie"" can distract you from your own sinking feeling that youve seen almost all of this before.

TWITTER With unappealing one-note characters retread concepts and implausible motivations Chappie is a further downward step for director Neill Blomkamp. Along with its innumerable other shortcomings Chappie is one of the annoyingly growing number of films in which any and every character -- here they run the gamut from techies to gangstas to robots -- can instantly break into any computer system whenever they need to in about two seconds; a quick flurry of finger moves over the keyboard and theyre invariably in no problem. Is there ever a movie in which characters do this and then cant get in? This is but a minor irritant in a film well endowed with major ones notably unappealing one-note characters retread concepts implausible motivations and a ludicrous survival rate given the firepower expended upon the central figures. After the surprise and promise of District 9 this represents a further downward step for director Neill Blomkamp in the wake of the highly uneven Elysium. At least ever since the original RoboCop 28 years ago audiences have come to grips with the notion of cyborg and/or mechanical crime fighters and Chappie merely flips the equation with geeky Johannesburg police force artificial intelligence engineer Deon (Dev Patel) announcing that one of his robot cops has crossed the line to become a thinking and feeling being. This is too much for hard-line engineer Vincent (Hugh Jackman) who believes that the manmade soldiers are there to obey orders and not think for themselves; they have after all helped bring down the violent crime rate in Joburg. Hes also devised a giant new crime buster named The Moose which his boss Michelle (Sigourney Weaver) refuses to activate. But you dont introduce a critter like this unless you intend to use him later on. Read more Director Neill Blomkamp on New Alien Film It Will Ignore Last Two Sequels Unfortunately much of the interim time is spent in the company of a trio of unsavory punks who know little but how to strike menacing poses shriek threats and brandish weapons. In deep on the wrong side of a debt to a local crime lord skinny and stupid Ninja and motherly punk Yo-Landi (played by the self-same Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser of the rave rap group Die Antwoord) along with relatively even-keeled cohort Yankie (Jose Pablo Cantillo) manage to kidnap Chappie -- whom Deon has just begun to teach about the human world -- with the idea of using the robot to pull off a major heist. Chappie a man-size construct made mostly of what looks like gunmetal is an eager sponge at this early stage of life absorbing and imitating everything he sees and hears like a child. Its supposed to be hilarious when after his brief tutelage with the straitlaced Deon Chappie begins speaking filthy and nasty like his new guardians is adorned with gangsta-style bling and is taught how to be a cool badass. Instead it comes off as cheap and even depressing one more young soul lost to the underworld. After persistently threatening Deon to within an inch of his life the crims just let him go even though he works with the cops and knows the location of the dump where the lowlifes live. Just as far-fetched is Vincent pulling a gun on Deon in the formers office. But what permanently tips Chappie over from a drama that might deserve ones sympathetic charity to something ridiculous is a rant by Deon about the punks pernicious influence on Chappie that ends with the young man fulminating that Ninja is nothing less than ... a philistine Now thats telling him. Read more Why Neill Blomkamp Shouldnt Resurrect Alien After All (Opinion) Ultimately Chappie is pulled this way and that by people for whom he fills different roles For Deon hes the invention of a lifetime; for Ninja and Yo-Landi hes the child theyll never have; and for Vincent hes the representation of what he hates a sentient being rather than an unthinking soldier made to follow orders. And for the audience Chappie is a charmless and irritating bugger. The way hes designed with the barest semblance of a face theres no entry point to invite human feelings for him and his often frantic speech patterns are off-putting. Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley not only voiced the character but performed the role on-set so the other actors could relate to him his characters actual look subsequently ""painted"" over the actor via CGI. The technique works flawlessly but that doesnt make the character lovable. As the action mounts toward the end any sense of plausible logistics and physical realities are tossed aside as characters just sort of magically get from point A to B and end up right where they need to be to force an encounter or showdown. When The Moose is finally unleashed its destructive power proves rather less all-encompassing than suspected. And while the renegade anti-establishment outlook of the director who wrote the script with his District 9 partner Terri Tatchell remains unmistakable its so pro forma and predictable here as to feel rote. Read more Neill Blomkamp Opens Up About Alien Concept Art Potential Movie With the partial exception of Visser whose punky veneer nicely melts into motherly concern and warmth the actors are straitjacketed with unlikable characters notable for their ill-advised judgment. No ones any fun here even in their villainy. With the exception of the police office most of the action takes place in particularly unsavory sections of Joburg and the film at times sports a wan video look especially in certain daytime exteriors.

Intelligence artificial or otherwise is one of the major casualties of ""Chappie"" a robot-themed action movie that winds up feeling as clunky and confused as the childlike droid with which it shares its name. Mashing together various elements from director Neill Blomkamps earlier sci-fi pictures (including another prominent role for Sharlto Copley) this South African spin on ""Short Circuit"" displays the same handheld immediacy and scene-setting verve as its predecessors but all in service of a chaotically plotted story and a central character so frankly unappealing he almost makes Jar Jar Binks seem like tolerable company by comparison. Absent ""District 9s"" subtle apartheid allegory or ""Elysiums"" health-care brief but offering a bizarre performance showcase for the rap-rave group Die Antwoord Blomkamps third feature exhausts its meager ideas and the viewer well before the end of its two-hour running time. Curiosity will beckon for a few but this rickety vehicle isnt the one to reverse Sonys recent fortunes. Starting with his ingenious justly celebrated debut ""District 9"" (2009) Blomkamp has employed the trappings of science fiction to cast a darkly satirical eye on our troubled species albeit to steadily diminishing returns Like 2013s ambitious disappointing ""Elysium"" this lower-budget smaller-scaled thriller imagines a society on the brink of collapse only to resolve its intriguing scenario with a startling lack of follow-through or finesse. Of course Blomkamps previous pictures arent the only ones to which ""Chappie"" genially tips its hat With its tale of crime-fighting sentinels one of which is reborn as a sort of silicon-souled Pinocchio the film effectively connects the narrative circuitry of ""A.I."" to that of the ""RoboCop"" franchise. Genre completists may be reminded of still more recent dramas -- from ""Her"" and ""Transcendence"" to ""Automata"" and ""Ex Machina"" -- that have touched on such heady topics as robot sentience transferred consciousness and the always-tricky matter of human-bot relations. Co-writing with his wife Terri Tatchell (with whom he also collaborated on ""District 9"") Blomkamp once again employs mock news footage to establish his premise in tense run-and-gun fashion. Sometime in the not-so-distant future Johannesburg is being policed by an army of highly functional human-sized droids -- the brainchild of Deon (Dev Patel) lead designer at a robotics firm called Tetra Vaal. Intimidating but not invincible these heavily armed soldiers have effectively neutralized the citys thugs and drug dealers as we see in an explosive early shootout involving two bottom-feeding gangsters Ninja and Yo-Landi (played by Die Antoords Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser). Although hes proud of his rabbit-eared battery-operated automatons Deon yearns to contribute something more meaningful to the world -- namely to develop an android that doesnt just kill but can read books appreciate art and think and talk for itself. Defying the orders of Tetra Vaals bottom-line-minded CEO Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) and arousing the suspicion of a jealous corporate rival Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) Deon steals the remains of Scout 22 a droid felled in the line of duty to test his latest experiment in synthetic consciousness. Unfortunately hes then kidnapped by Ninja Yo-Landi and their accomplice Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) who are foolishly convinced that Deon can stop the ""robot pigs"" with the press of a button. When they realize he has a droid in his possession they order him to revive it so they can make their own killing machine -- and although Deon has no intention of helping them his own scientific curiosity soon gets the better of him. In short order Scout 22s memory is erased his damaged parts are repaired and hes reborn as Chappie (voiced by Copley) the name given to him by Yo-Landi (after South Africas most famous brand of bubblegum) who turns out to have quite a maternal side. Like a besotted mother and father she and Deon hope to give their frightened uncomprehending droid a proper upbringing -- teaching him English encouraging him in his artistic pursuits and letting him know that he can do anything he puts his metallic mind to. But Ninja and Amerika are determined to turn Chappie into a ruthless robo-killer and so they fill his head with hip-hop slang teach him to fire a gun outfit him in tacky gold necklaces and (in one particularly cruel display of tough love) drop him off in one of the sketchier parts of Joburg where hes assaulted by hooligans who mistake him for a cop. By treating Chappie as a highly impressionable blank slate -- a Candide for the computer age -- the movie comes awfully close to playing like a very special dystopian episode of ""Extreme Guide to Parenting."" Just as the concept for ""District 9"" originated in the 2006 short ""Alive in Joburg"" so ""Chappie"" suggests an extension of images and ideas from three other byte-sized Blomkamp pics ""Tetra Vaal"" (2004) ""Tempbot"" (2006) and especially ""Adicolor Yellow"" (2006) about an android programmed with enough intelligence and learning ability to dwell among humans permanently. At the scripts core is the philosophical quandary of whether Chappie can develop a mind and conscience of his own defy the gangsters negative influence and keep his promise to Deon that he wont hurt anyone (a sort of loose reworking of Isaac Asimovs ""Three Laws of Robotics""). Alas its hard to glean much profundity or poignancy in the battle for Chappies soul given how little of it he evinces onscreen; as written and performed he comes off as such a tiresome hyper-aggressive chatterbox that you keep hoping someone will flip his off switch. Granted not every artificial intelligence needs to be as compelling as HAL 9000 or as captivating as WALL-E. But those two creations were nothing if not a demonstration of how expressive silence can be while showing the level of artistry required to imbue a hunk of metal with genuinely lifelike attributes. For better and for worse Blomkamp and his collaborators (including the visual-effects team of Image Engine and the physical-effects team of Weta Workshop) have given us a frenetic robot protagonist who when hes not throwing knives or smashing cars insists on questioning those around him at every turn all while bearing horrified witness to the general awfulness of humanity. Before long Chappie isnt just asking ""What is the Internet?"" but ""Why do you humans do this?"" -- an excellent query to be sure but by that point you may feel too enervated to give it the weight it deserves. There may be an intriguing subtext to the fact that Copley after so brilliantly morphing into a man-mutant hybrid in ""District 9"" has seemed less and less human in each of Blomkamps subsequent features -- first as a cardboard villain in ""Elysium"" and now as a robots voice. The filmmaker has long evinced a fascination with the bodys ability to push against and ultimately transcend its physical limits and by the end ""Chappie"" seems to look ahead to a possible next phase of human existence albeit one that feels at once implausibly convenient and dramatically tacked-on. Suffice to say that things seems to conclude precisely at the point where they might have started to get interesting. By that point ""Chappie"" has long since settled into the groove of a thoroughly competent if pro forma action movie nimbly shot on location by d.p. Trent Opaloch coherently assembled by editors Julian Clarke and Mark Goldblatt and neatly visualized by production designer Jules Cook as a world of nondescript offices vast warehouses and one stylish gangster hideaway. Machine guns are fired and bombs are detonated most of them by Jackmans one-note bad guy whose own competing brand of weapon technology is built on the notion that robots must always remain subservient to humans. In a smarter more nuanced film Moore might have come across as a dissenting voice of reason rather than a raving psychopath (who just in case the mullet wasnt enough of a giveaway is a religious nut to boot). The proceedings feel awfully short on human engagement overall; Patel is just OK as the sympathetic Dr. Frankenstein figure and Weaver though always a welcome presence is basically on hand to confer her sci-fi seal of approval (and perhaps remind audiences that Blomkamp has an ""Alien"" movie coming up next). By far the most curious casting choice is that of South African hip-hop artists Ninja and Visser who have always playfully blurred the line between their onstage and offstage personae. Here projecting a (somewhat) exaggerated version of their already outlandish identities they seem more or less of a piece with the scattershot proceedings and their performances do improve after their shouty gun-waving histrionics early on. Lending the picture an occasional burst of anarchic energy are Die Antwoords numerous contributions to the soundtrack of which the infernally catchy ""Enter the Ninja"" is merely the most recognizable.

Killy says June 20 2015 at 556 pm I just finished watching Chappie and it was total crap. I love Die Antwoord but their music seemed out of place and I found the entire movie more annoying than anything else. Too much plugging Die Antwoord and just a poorly done film. Reply Charles Stern says June 18 2015 at 1250 pm Chappie = RoboCop + 1970s Street Gang ""C"" Movie Reply Syed Shazeb says May 29 2015 at 1035 pm oh man. Chappie was freaking amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. great acting and was emotional too Reply Hannover Fisst says May 27 2015 at 217 pm I enjoyed the directors previous films however I didnt like this one much. While the technology aspects were quite nice I found the whole thing a bit of a RoboCop ripoff. Even up to the ED-209 clone which they called the MOOSE. The punk rocker criminals with a heart aspect was completely dumb to me and I lost it when Chappie started getting all gangsta imitating his new street-dwelling owners. Tack on that unbearable South African accent they gave him and I barely made it to the end of this movie. The ending seemed a bit thrown together to me and frankly I was just glad it was over with. I did find some enjoyable moments and found the part very sad when he was left to fend for himself in order to see the real world. I really wanted to like this movie but there were too many things that irritated me while watching it to truly enjoy it. Sorry Im not a cognitive scientist and Ive never worked on AI but Ive watched a lot of movies and I do love robots. Just not Chappie. Reply Cog Sci guy says March 28 2015 at 1125 pm As a cognitive scientist who has worked in artificial intelligence research and development for years Im amazed the reviewer could even spell ""robot"" let alone have the faintest idea how any kind of developmental artificial intelligence patterned after human learning and development works. Ive seen a LOT of AI movies in my day and not many were noteworthy. ""CHAPPiE"" does something few other AI films have done it gets most of the science of developmental robotics almost right and I can count the movies that have done that on the fingers of one hand. Considerable cinematic license had to be taken (CHAPPiE learned too much too quickly but if that were done realistically the movie would have been endless and very boring) but thats no crime. Get the outline of the science right as in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""Contact"" and the outcome may be brilliant. ""CHAPPiE"" isnt a brilliant film and it does have a few technical errors in it (like the silly robot police force that is supposed to be incapable of learning what CHAPPiE can; we currently have speech recognition systems that are smarter than that). Its a nice story told quite adequately by people who arent complete morons. Of course it resembles other science fiction robot films and uses some familiar AI tropes. AI as one of the cognitive sciences is a set of fruitful research domains. AI robot movies are not although they can be entertaining. Enjoy the movie for what it is cheap fun. Send the dumb robot police to arrest the reviewers and make them watch ""Lucy"" (a film that looked to me like an 8th grade school project with parents ""helping"") 100 times without a break. Reply Debra Di Blasi says March 16 2015 at 450 pm Getting really quite tired of movie critics who either (1) have not done their socio-economic/political homework to thoroughly contextualize a film and/or (2) simply are not astute enough for nuances. Chappie was brilliant with complex underlying existential and political questions. And equally as important both the masculine and feminine archetypes were presented -- something that Hollywood rarely cares about. Reply Jaoo says March 15 2015 at 922 am Why didnt anybody compared this to Robocop 1? Its so much the same. I thought it was closer to Robocop than Short-Circuit. I pretty much agree with Andrew Jonsson. This movie was really deep. There was also some Marxism(thug education vs engineer education) in that movie. Reply Andrew Jonsson says March 8 2015 at 443 pm I feel like you completely missed the mark on your review. You gave kudos to a Wall-E which was dumbed down for a child audience and you somehow missed all of the subtly and intricacies of Chappie. Wall-E hits you with a sledgehammer do deliver its message Chappie requires you to look deeper. You cant skim the surface on this one like a Pixar movie which can be summarized in two to three sentences. It is a movie about South African society and culture not a fantasy world where humans are fat on a cruise ship (Wow sooo deep). Die Antwoord is about suffering mental illness and societal degeneration. They are about being famous in the face of criticism. They are an embodiment of their culture. It was an incredible realization to include them into this movie which delves into societal impact and upbringing. Listen to their music and truly understand their message. At the end of one of their tracks he speaks directly to his critics ""Who thought I was a loser who thought I was nobody who thought I was a fcking psycho...well look at me now"". This is Chappie. He was a loser. He was scrap metal. He was able to code human consciousness with a handful of PS4s being raised by street thugs. He saved his creator and saved his mommy. It isnt an action movie as hollow as metal robots fighting like Transformers. If you have suffered in life dealt with or know those who have suffered as losers and nobodies... this movie is so much more. I didnt even dive into the humanity aspect where the human controlled robot was more harm than the robots themselves. Good vs Evil and the complexity therein. This was a deep movie. Sorry you didnt see the same movie that I did Reply Peggy says March 5 2015 at 837 am District 9 was a racist piece of shit. This director has now proven he does not deserve to get his hands on the Alien franchise. Hollywood is creatively broken. Everyone is running to TV which may only serve to help empty Hollywood of all the crappy derivative filmmakers and leave the truly talented ones left to make films. But only if they open it up to more women and minorities. Neil Blomkamp is proof that white males have destroyed Hollywood. Reply Tim Lammers says March 4 2015 at 848 pm The guy does a sign of the cross a half-dozen times during the film and that makes him a religious nut? Reply Paully says March 4 2015 at 754 pm This director is using up his goodwill rather fast dont you think? I will wait for the video. Reply LOL says March 4 2015 at 151 pm At least its an original movie that is not a sequel or spin-off. Reply briandanacamp says March 4 2015 at 1219 pm Ythink Blomkamp watches anime? From the plot description here Id say he watches a LOT of it Reply seattlelibtard says March 4 2015 at 1155 am So this is a ""Short Circuit"" reboot? Reply irwinator1992 says March 4 2015 at 1146 am I guess Ill save my money and see the new Divergent film instead. And after that its the new Avengers for me. Reply Prompter Bob (PrompterBob) says March 4 2015 at 1026 am I was never impressed by the trailers and after being burned by watching ELYSIUM I had low expectations. The mostly negative reviews back up my feelings. Im sure the film will be dubbed CRAPPIE - if it hasnt been already. I fear for the future of the ALIEN franchise in Neils hands. Reply Andrew Jonsson says March 8 2015 at 445 pm You have to see the movie for itself. It isnt an action movie. There were times where I actually was choking back tears. Its a movie that hurts. Its a movie that you love. It is a powerful movie. Dont let the negative reviews dissuade you. It truly is great. Especially if you understand Die Antwoord. Reply manny says March 4 2015 at 410 pm CRAPPIE hahahhaha you made cry. Though I agree there are better directors than him that could helm the franchise. Reply brad says March 4 2015 at 1013 am The trailer alone was painful 120 minutes of that no thanks. Reply GeorgeValentin says March 4 2015 at 956 am Hugh Jackman does wear tan trousers in this movie so the film will be a good one. Reply John Doe says March 4 2015 at 951 am ""Absent ""District 9s"" subtle apartheid allegory"" This is a joke right? Reply Anna Q says March 4 2015 at 948 am Much like the Wachowski`s this guy was lauded as the next great talent far too prematurely. Reply Inv says March 4 2015 at 908 am Hahaha. Getting worried yet?
