With Cuba Gooding Jr. Skeet Ulrich Peter Firth. Directed by Hugh Johnson. Rated R Lots of violence rough language. Running time 102 mins. At area theaters. 2 Stars First Hollywood showed Cuba Gooding Jr. theOscar. Then they showed him the money. Now theyve shown him Skeet Ulrich. This represents a serious reversal of fortune. Ulrich is a low-wattage personality and hes virtually invisible next to the floodlight screen presence of Gooding in this buddy movie. That wouldnt be such a problem if Gooding was the No. 1 buddy but he functions as a sidekick here. Most of the action revolves around Ulrichs character and the center cannot hold our interest. ""Chill Factor"" has a lumbering setup about a chemical weapon that got out of control and exploded years ago killing many soldiers and unjustly landing a career officer (Peter Firth) in federal prison. Now years later Firths character comes roaring out of the pen aiming his attack squad mysteriously ready for him the day hes sprung at the scientist (David Paymer) who developed the lethal muck. Then this crack squadron will sell the killer gunk off to the terrorist with the most bucks. Diner counterman Ulrich and ice-cream deliverer Gooding get in the way teaming up a few minutes after they meet. Why is Gooding an ice-cream man? Because the deadly crystals go liquid and explode when they warm to 50 degrees. This is a cookie-cutter buddy movie as predictable as they come so we know that the thermometer on the fatal phlegm will come ohsoclose to the trigger point many times. More suspenseful is the wait for Ulrich to show some charisma. This tedium is relieved by the lock-eyed intensity of Firth who manages to be wonderfully nasty without raising his voice. And for sheer pizzazz you cant go wrong with Gooding who regularly gives it up in movies and TV commercials. If youre one of the people who dislikes his intensity you should stay away. Me I would never dream of making him chill. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Share Tweet Chill Factor boasts a premise so horrifyingly banal that it seems less like the plot of a movie than a proposal a screenwriter would put in the mouth of a clueless producer character to illustrate Hollywoods humorous lack of creativity. The film revolves around two working-class louts (Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich an action-comedy team nobody has been waiting for) who stumble upon an enormously destructive device that will explode if it reaches a temperature above 50 degrees. Needless to say this Leslie Nielsen-worthy plot somehow necessitates something like 45 minutes of ponderous exposition before the charmless luckless duo even takes it on the road. As an unintentional send-up of the predictability and wretchedness of modern action-comedies Chill Factor is hilarious. Sadly however no one involved seems to realize the silliness and transgressive stupidity of its sub-direct-to-video-thriller script. A good indication of the level of thought that went into Chill Factor is a solid 20-minute stretch in which nearly every word out of Oscar-winner Goodings mouth is either ""Oh shit"" or ""Oh fuck"" His relentless cursing might have worked had it served as some sort of running gag but its more likely that no one involved could think of anything wittier for the beloved Pepsi One pitchman to say. With its one-dimensional characters frequent and unmotivated explosions--its as if producers demanded that something blow up every 20 minutes regardless of whats going on--and lack of suspense Chill Factor is unintentional self-parody in its highest form. For the masochistic its a Jack Frost-level gem. For those who like to stick to good movies avoid it at all costs.

Comments (1) Chill Factor A military secret weapon that can obliterate everything in its path is intercepted by a couple of working-class stiffs (Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr.) in Montana and pursued by a disgruntled and scapegoated major (Peter Firth) who wants to make a zillion dollars by holding the world at ransom. This action-adventure movie shows the usual contempt for life humanity art the audience intelligence characterization and plot and the usual affection for stunts minor star turns and cliches. The stunt work is pretty good the brain work close to nonexistent. Directed by Hugh Johnson from a script by Drew Gitlin and Mike Cheda; with David Paymer and Kevin J. OConnor.

Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich. Directed by Hugh Johnson. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Chill Factor"" is the latest installment of the continuing series When Bad Things Happen to Good Actors. Stars Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich have a lot going for them individually and with any luck will continue to have in other pictures. ""Chill Factor"" is all over the map. For long stretches its the map of Montana (actually South Carolina and Utah) whose wide-open spaces often are the only interesting thing to watch. This poor excuse for a thriller turns with a great crunching of gears into a mess of a buddy comedy. Either way it misfires. Fitfully it keeps coming to life with an isolated bit of action or a routine that doesnt seem like an act of desperation. Finally Gooding has to resort to doing what amounts to Cuba Gooding Jr. shtick -- flashes of -- manic energy and sudden reversals. After almost single-handedly keeping ""What Dreams May Come"" and ""Instinct"" afloat Gooding is too young to start doing imitations of himself. Its dismaying. He needs to recharge his batteries. The compelling figure in the early going -- while we are led to believe mistakenly that this is a thriller -- is Peter Firth as Army Maj. Andrew Brynner. When a wasted- looking lab assistant for a covert chemical-weapons test on a Pacific atoll lights up a joint he is fried in a horrific explosion. Dedicated officer Brynner is made the fall guy after 18 of his men die. He has 10 years in a military prison to brood about revenge. Brynner emerges from prison as leader of a paramilitary gang of terrorists tracking down the inventor of the chemical weapon and Firth (""Equus"" ""Mighty Joe Young"") starts out as a villain to be reckoned with especially after a couple of throats are slit during an invasion of a military base. Bizarrely the chase that follows turns comic or tries to. Gooding and Ulrich play a couple of strangers unwillingly thrown together as the targets of Brynners gang. After a lot of clunky expository dialogue where characters sit around explaining to each other things they already know the audience finally comes alive at the sight of Gooding driving an ice-cream freezer truck. Something seems fishy when the driver Arlo starts suggesting that the counterman in a country-store diner pay him in cash although he stops short of saying ""Show me the money."" Ulrich plays the counterman who works the night shift and is called Night Shift in what may be the most imaginative aspect of this movie. The gimmick sure aint. Night Shift hijacks Arlos freezer truck after the secret chemical explosive code-named Elvis falls into their hands and Brynner gets on their trail. Elvis is in a canister that must be kept below 50 degrees or it will blow up. Does this ring a bell? Brazenly and shamelessly its the plot of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullocks ""Speed"" except in their case the bus carrying the explosive would blow up if it went slower than 50 mph. Substituting Gooding and Ulrich for Reeves and Bullock doesnt really cut it. They have the chemicals but not the chemistry. The tone shifts to a buddy comedy about a couple of losers in over their heads. When the temperature of the canister approaches 50 degrees its a halfhearted effort at suspense. None of us really gives a damn. Stuff happens. The truck forces a cyclist into oncoming traffic the cyclist leaps to the truck there is a hand-to-hand fight on the roof. Gooding and Ulrich end up with the canister in a boat. Nobody really cares if the truck or boat blows up and some of us may even start hoping one of them does. ..

Utterly lacking the drive and roller-coaster energy expected of top action pics this latest try at repackaging ""Speed"" is a Kmart version of a Jerry Bruckheimer production. High-end actioners of late have been criticized for their overload of testosterone but ""Chill Factor"" could have used an increased dose of the stuff. Utterly lacking the drive and roller-coaster energy expected of top action pics this latest try at repackaging ""Speed"" is a Kmart version of a Jerry Bruckheimer production. The risk inherent in the against-the-grain casting of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich fails to pay any dividends and this deep-popcorn project arrives much too late in the waning days of summer to generate much B.O. heat. Ancillary venues await. Ridley Scott protege Hugh Johnson is the tyro helmer and though he shares Scotts tin ear for humor he hasnt yet developed Scotts ability to turn intense physical drama into something visually arresting. Script by Drew Gitlin and Mike Cheda does not help the cause employing the popular fear of chemical weapons for a high-concept mishmash that at various times brazenly borrows not just from ""Speed"" but from Clouzots ""The Wages of Fear"" ""Breakdown"" ""The Rock"" ""48HRS."" and ""Midnight Run."" Amid all this filmers forget to inject the genre piece with the essential ingredient of new thrills to maintain core auds attention. The borrowings begin during a 10-minute prologue set on remote Horn Island in the South Pacific where chemical scientist Dr. Richard Long (David Paymer) is capping a series of tests for the Army of ""Elvis"" his long-in-development chemical weapon. Supervising military honcho Capt. Andrew Brynner (Peter Firth) is darkly skeptical about the device and wants his men cleared off the isle before a final test. Longs nerdy assistant Telstar (Kevin J. OConnor) asks ""Hey doc whats up?"" -- it is a Warner Bros. release -- but its not long before he and the rest of the outdoor crew are fried to a crisp by the exploding Elvis which must be maintained below a temperature of 50 degrees. Longs response borrows from Robert Oppenheimers reaction to his Los Alamos nuke experiment ""I am become death the destroyer of worlds."" Ten years pass and Brynner -- tried and imprisoned as fall guy for the tragedy by a military court -- is released from prison and filled with a bitter longing for revenge against Long who has continued his Elvis work for the Army in Montana. Hes a fly-fishing buddy of diner clerk Tim Mason (Ulrich) and offers some fishing tips that Tim no doubt will find useful later. At the diner Brynner portentously visits Long and then preps his obscenely well-armed black-leather-clad crew comprising Hollywoods standard mix of cold-eyed multiracial multigender baddies. Just as Brynners black-ops team hatches its plot to kill Long steal Elvis and auction it off to the highest international bidder (details of which are revealed only sparingly through the three acts) it so happens that ice cream delivery guy Arlo (Gooding) is making a stop at the diner. Badly wounded and near death after Brynners invasion of his lab Long stumbles into the diner and shepherding Elvis -- a gooey blue substance -- explains that Tim has to get the weapon safely (on ice natch) to nearby Fort McGruder before Brynner catches up. After the first of several unfunny exchanges between Tim and a resistant Arlo the duo blow out of Dodge with Elvis in Arlos truck. This would seem to set up a series of increasingly tense heart-stopping chase sequences with the twin pressures of the remorseless Brynner storm troopers on one hand and on the other the need to keep Elvis cool. Instead of a continuous sequence of action though Gitlin and Cheda pen individual chase scenes with the action flow continually interrupted by lame timeouts and comic relief. Pacing is alternately slack and taut just as the tone is schizoid -- straitlaced enough to take the threat of chem weapons seriously but just this side of ""Midnight Run""-style comedy. Most critically pic lacks the decisive energy to deliver either solidly consistent action or a smart sendup of the genre. Johnsons ramrod direction and Firths utterly blank and non-ironic monotone delivery suggest the former while Goodings antics suggest the latter. Biggest blown opportunity though is building black humor around keeping Elvis near the chill factor; instead there are obvious one-liners such as Army investigator Col. Leo Vitellis (Daniel Hugh Kelly) declaration that ""Elvis has left the building."" More disappointing is the combo of Ulrich and Gooding who have amply demonstrated a wide range of thesping chops on their own but simply do not click here. Ulrich would seem to be an ideal choice as a young slacker innocent far out of his depth and forced to summon up hidden resources but the lively imagination this actor tends to bring to his work is AWOL. Gooding comes off as desperately trying to salvage a slumping affair with some now-familiar shtick and never rises above his role as a mere plot device. While physical production impressively shows off a notable range of outdoor locales they too often resemble a more Southwestern U.S. milieu (primary lensing took place in Utah) than the storys Montana setting. Several opportunities for eye-filling vistas and set pieces -- particularly during key action at a dam and in an enormous highway tunnel -- are underwhelming. Tech credits are workmanlike pro.

Screwing up his face into a pantomime of fury Gooding looks at his partner Skeet Ulrich and screams out lines like ""Im about to get in yo ass like last years underwear"" Even these scenes though pale in embarrassment next to the ones where Gooding slips into fearful pop-eyed cartoon-panic mode. Doesnt he realize hes undermining his authority as a star? Hes choosing films and playing his roles as if he were scared no one was going to show him the money. For an African-American actor in Hollywood that may be an understandable anxiety but still couldnt he have had the moxie to say no to this one? It was 30 years ago that ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" introduced the ""buddy film"" (a phrase coined by critic Molly Haskell) so perhaps its time to observe that this most durable of all contemporary genres has also become the most deadening in its repetition its forced bonhomie and macho ""romance"" rituals. In ""Chill Factor"" Gooding and Ulrich are such youthful unfettered performers that they seem like adolescents pretending to be men getting in touch with their inner boys. The two are forced to flee with a canister of chemical weapons which they transport in an ice cream truck through the mountain highways of Montana; if the temperature of the canister rises to 50 degrees it will explode. There is much body-smashed-by-an-overpass mayhem as well as preposterous no-sweat remarks made in the face of danger. The people who made ""Chill Factor"" probably think its ""Speed"" meets ""Lethal Weapon"" meets ""The Wages of Fear"" but to describe it that way is to acknowledge that its less a movie than a pitch meeting on celluloid.
