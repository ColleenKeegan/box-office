Blessed be beer flicks with broad laughs and bright underwear Add to ... Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Nov. 12 2009 132PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day Written and directed by Troy Duffy Starring Sean Patrick Flanery Norman Reedus Julie Benz Billy Connolly Clifton Collins Jr. Judd Nelson Robb Wells Peter Fonda and Willem Dafoe Classification 14A Movies are generally made by refined types who came of age listening to Talking Heads - wine drinkers lets call them. Without even trying they cut themselves off from the vast vaguely resentful demographic that grew up on Guns N Roses and (non-imported) beer. No surprise then that when a beer guy somehow gets a movie made wine drinkers - the film industry - smirk and look the other way. No surprise either that the movie goes right to video. Nor perhaps should we be truly shocked when the scruffy reject becomes a hit anyway. Such is the story of the cult favourite The Boondock Saints  a 1999 film with lots of slow-motion shoot-em-ups and a soundtrack cranked way up to 11. Made by a New England pit bull named Troy Duffy The Saints made it into only five theatres and was whacked by critics but eventually raked in over 50-million (U.S.) in DVD rentals and sales. (Duffy reportedly never made a cent.) Now 10 years later comes the inevitable sequel The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day  the story of the chain-smoking Jaysus-loving McManus brothers - two fine Irish lads native Bostonians who have been hiding out on the Emerald Isle Corleone-style (theyve even grown beards) but must now return home to avenge the death of a beloved parish priest. Arriving stateside the brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) land smack in the middle of a gang war a vicious contest involving gun-toting Irish and Italian hoodlums. Why Italians? Well tradition. There is a history of tubby Italian screen mobsters from The Godfather s Luca Brasi to Fat Tony on The Simpson s. And filmmaker Duffy enjoys filming cool super-slow-mo sequences featuring bullet-riddled jelly bellies. There are also a number of ""funny"" scenes that include fat naked gangsters. More jiggling. And sometimes for a change of pace we get fat hairy Italians wearing nothing but bright skimpy underwear. In fact every scene here is supposed to be cool or funny sometimes both at the same time. Imagine Quentin Tarantino if he got his brow lowered. Duffys film even resorts to that kindergarten comedy staple turned-around names. The presumably ill-equipped gay FBI agent here is named - wait for it - Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe). Other characters include a leggy FBI agent ( Dexter s Julie Benz trying out a kooky Tennessee Williams Southern-belle accent) and Peter Fonda talking baby-Im-a-want-you Italian. While every shtick is as obvious and overemphatic as the guitar riff on Deep Purples Smoke on the Water  The Boondock Saints II does from time to time display a vulgar charm. Or maybe it just wears you out. Both wine and beer drinkers at its Toronto premiere laughed in harmony at the scene where the Italian mob leader (Judd Nelson) smacks a traitorous underling with a cured three-foot sausage.

"Boondock Saints II Praise be to patron saint of cult film sequels | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBoondock Saints II Praise be to patron saint of cult film sequelsBold prediction At his current glacial pace of progress Troy Duffy is likely to write and direct the great Irish-American payback movie sometime in the year 2049.Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery are back as pious but deadly bros in The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day much of which was shot in Toronto.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 13 2009Starring Sean Patrick Flanery Norman Reedus Julie Benz Billy Connolly Clifton Collins Jr. and Peter Fonda. Written and directed by Troy Duffy. 117 minutes. At major theatres. 14ABold prediction At his current glacial pace of progress Troy Duffy is likely to write and direct the great Irish-American payback movie sometime in the year 2049.In the meantime theres the craptacular The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day which improves upon its 1999 predecessor in ways only scientists hardy critics and rabid fans could verify. You remember the unfortunate cat? Yes its back for a better laugh but blink and youll miss it.The fact that this movie even exists in all its profane racist misogynistic sacrilegious bullet-ridden and insanely stupid glory is testament both to Duffys tenacity and to a resurrection born of DVD cult viewings of The Boondock Saints original.Article Continued Below The first film had a devil of a time getting seen at theatres. It had the bad luck of glorifying trench-coated killers just when Hollywood was under fire for supposedly inspiring the trench-coated killers of the 1999 Columbine High rampage. The movie was consigned to oblivion released to a handful of U.S. theatres and none at all in Canada (even though much of it had been filmed in Toronto as was the sequel). Duffy had been a protege of Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein but the directors fury at having his feature debut body-bagged led to a memorable battle that was chronicled in the documentary expose Overnight.Hence the decade delay for the sequel during which Boondock Saints became a DVD hit that is now being capitalized upon. Duffy has sharpened his marketing and technical skills in the interim but evidently failed to attend his remedial classes in writing and directing. Boondock Saints II is every bit as violent cheap nasty and nonsensical as its unholy predecessor. It is still grossly offensive to Roman Catholics who luckily arent prone to issue fatwas against cultural offenders.Duffy is still thieving from the likes of Quentin Tarantino John Woo and now Francis Ford Coppola whose The Godfather II provides inspiration for Boondock Saints IIs loopy flashbacks and Peter Fondas hilariously atrocious take on Don Corleone.And of course Duffy is sticking with leads Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as Boston fightin Irish bros Connor and Murphy MacManus the two most wooden action heroes since Pinocchio. In every respect this movie deserves to be beaten senseless with a soggy shillelagh. Yet how do I explain the fact that I sat through it with a silly grin on my face and the so-bad-its-good 2 1/2 star rating I have generously assigned it?Let it be said that Duffy knows his audience better than most. He doesnt so much make movies as arrange celluloid stag parties for the faithful. The boisterous public screening I attended had a row of seats reserved for McVeighs Irish Pub the Church St. saloon featured in both Boondock movies and we were informed before the titles rolled that two-for-one shots would be available later that evening at McVeighs for thirsty cineastes. Top that Citizen KaneThe plot? You would insist upon that wouldnt you? Boondock II picks up where Boondock I left off with the pious Brothers MacManus having reunited with their equally Lord-praising and ammunition-passing father Poppa M who is implausibly played by the Scots comic Billy Connolly. Theyve been pursuing quiet lives as sheep lovers in Ireland having asked themselves What Jesus Would Do about gangsters and having decided that Jesus would want them to shoot up a Boston courtroom. (Providence apparently also asked them to share a tattoo of a crucified Christ with one bro having the top part and the other the bottom. Paging Dr. Freud ...) The vicious killing of a priest back home in Boston seems to be linked to the unfinished business of that courtroom shootout a decade earlier and it pulls the Saints out of retirement and on a slow boat stateside. Whereupon they meet trigger-happy Mexican admirer Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr. in full bug-eyed mode) who provides a handy whipping boy whenever a racist gag is needed. Collins also subs for David Della Roccos clumsy comedian character from the first picture which is reduced to a cameo this time.So far so predictable. But the one casting coup that Duffy couldnt pull off rehiring Willem Dafoe to reprise gay psychic FBI sleuth Paul Smecker who so enlivened the first film has been turned from a loss into a big win by Dafoes replacement Julie Benz a real firecracker.Shes a veteran of more truly bad ""B"" movies than she probably cares to remember - including Saw V and Punisher War Zone - and she knows quality ham when she sees it. Her Special Agent Eunice Bloom aide to Smecker continues the Boondock boondoogle of stopping the action every second scene or so to recreate a bulletfest committed by Connor Murphy and now Romeo.The very sexy Ms. Benz takes no prisoners unless theyre first filled with lead and her over-the-top re-enactments of the latest MacManus mayhem make her seem like Annie Oakley on peyote.All this and Duffy still manages to pull a rabbit out of his hat but of this I can say no more. I would except Im laughing too hard. Meet me back here in 2019 for Boondock Saints 3 when shots at McVeighs will hopefully still be two for one.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Theres a slapdash punk rock vibe to this sequel ( rated R for violence language and some nudity) that shouldnt bother fans of the original 1999 cult hit. As for everyone else youve been warned. The film follows the vigilante McManus brothers (returning stars Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery) fun-loving Irish Catholic lads who think theyre on a divine mission to assassinate evil men. Before a showdown one wisecracks ""Lets do some gratuitous violence"" which is the movies guiding principle. The brothers quest to rid Boston of wickedness is a jamboree of hard drinking hooliganism and trigger-happy high jinks; this is surely the first film where a mobster is bludgeoned with a salami. The film spins off in ""Godfather""-inspired flashbacks and outlandish fantasy sequences. Julie Benz (of TVs ""Dexter"" pictured with Clifton Collins Jr.) plays a steel-magnolia Southern FBI agent who studies the boys crime scene carnage then imagines herself into their shootouts. She struts through the biggest firefight of them all inexplicably dressed in cowgirl-gunslinger garb as if she were in a Vegas version of ""Annie Get Your Gun."" Peter Fonda plays an aged Mafia don with a flagrantly bad Italian accent. Its as if writer/director Troy Duffy threw every idea he had at the wall creating a very messy wall.

Hes genuinely cool and he has a fabulous head of hair. The rest of this loose flap of a sequel which has arrived 10 long years after the original ""Boondock Saints"" made a pile in DVD rentals is just the same auld same auld.Writer-director Troy Duffy needs to YouTube himself a new idea or two because his variations on themes provided by Quentin Tarantino and Guy ""RocknRolla"" Ritchie are pure mold. In the original film the brothers played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus were sort of human. In the sequel they arent. Theyre just glib killing machines out to eliminate the gangsters responsible for killing a Boston priest in the style of our heroes the MacManus boys who are hiding out with their dad in Ireland in the storys early going.Quick as a couple of winks they hop a freighter---cross the Atlantic to return home where Nelsons bug-eyed overacting mobster is thirsty for blood. Julie Benz better than her material plays a federal agent warring with the local police. Feds clashing with local authorities---I hope someone reuses that sometime.Just as Willem Dafoes agent swanned around intuiting crime-scene flashbacks in the first film Benzs character does the same here. And sure as my dear mothers maiden name is Jeannie Gallagher Duffys film made me sad for the Irish in general and Irish-American vigilantes in particular.

An Apparition release. Running time 157. Posted at 060000 AM in Reviews Comments Wow its always amazing to me when a critic does not get it. Say what you will think what you will but this film was made due to the popularity of the first film and demanded by the fans A rare thing indeed for a film that did not gross well at the box office. The references to Guy Ritchie and Tarentino are way off base Troy Duffy did it first In fact the original Boondock Saints was the innovator of what is now known as the CSI effect. Yes the film is not as fresh as the original but how could it be? How can any sequel be for that matter? Sequels are not meant to reconstruct the wheel they are meant to give us more of what we loved the first time around. Most movies are made to entertain 1st not every movie is meant for serious reflection some times you want to just watch a fun flick and see the bad guys get there just deserts. Boondock saints 2 delivers exactly that an entertaining little flick taking the brothers to a new level of kick arse. Why critics have to be so harsh on films that were made to be fun I just dont get. Dont you want to have fun at the movies? Posted by Slade | March 10 2010 at 0750 AM Please keep writing reviews. Do not listen to the person who posted above me. I hated this movie so much I left after about 65% and got a refund. This is the one and only movie I have ever asked for a refund for in my 32 years of living. Anyone who likes this movie is a mindless moron that could be equally amused by a screen with flashing lights and swirls while speakers make loud bangs and explosions in the background for 2 hours. I am normally very lenient with movies. I hated Transporter 2 and I watched it in is entirety. The Irish Catholics and well just about anyone who sees this movie should be paid for their suffering. I do hope Troy Duffy keeps making movies and I will watch his next one. Everyone fails in life just PLEASE PLEASE do not make this same (Boondock Saints 2) mistake again PLEASE. -Gray Posted by Graymonster | March 06 2010 at 0337 AM You have absolutely no idea what your talking about. Please dont ever write another review ever again. The movie did have some corny parts like Bloom always talking in a slow seductive voice and a few others but it was enteraining. Yes the first one was better idk how u rated that one but that was an awesome film with the budget they had then wow. Anyways the new film had a few twists which were very entertaining but the movie over all atleast deserves a 6/10 or 3/5. You obviously are just like the rest of the critics out there that dont understand the movie nor the massive fan base BDS has. Just to wrap it up anyone who read this guys article go see the movie for yourself and make your own decision people bad mouth the movie because the direct Troy Duffy can be an  or something its not fair for one for the movie nor for you to miss out on a great movie. I rated it with a alittle bias being a huge fan myself i gave it a 8/10 Posted by Ben Smole | November 26 2009 at 0633 PM The comments to this entry are closed.

Norman Reedus) return to Boston to kill the Italian mobsters responsible for the murder of a priest. The first Boondock Saints (2000) charmed a cult audience with its gonzo bloodlust; the sequel The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day earns points only for being remarkably unself-conscious about its across-the-board ineptitude.

Credit Apparition Films In 1999 you could explain Troy Duffys ""Boondock Saints"" as a cheeseball riff on ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""True Romance"" -- Quentin Tarantino meets Wayne and Garth. How to explain a decade later his ""Boondock Saints II All Saints Day""? Apparently the world has been waiting for another cartoonishly violent broadly comic Boston Irish Catholic vigilante action movie with gay overtones.Mr. Duffy has reunited an impressive share of the original cast starting with Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the MacManus brothers the slaughterhouse workers turned righteous avengers who liquidated crowds of Russian and Italian mobsters in the original. Flushed from their hideout in Ireland they rejoin their bumbling allies on the Boston police force and ventilate some more goodfellas this time Italian and Chinese. Sadly Willem Dafoes gay F.B.I. agent is gone replaced by Julie Benz doing a hybrid Kyra Sedgwick-Sharon Stone impression. In an indicator of Mr. Duffys comic sensibility she wears a gun prominently strapped just above her crotch.Mr. Duffy again tells his story through successive heres-what-happened flashbacks and indulges in extreme movie love emulating blaxploitation and Hong Kong cop films and quoting everything from ""The Godfather"" to ""Titanic"" to ""Basic Instinct."" And at least a quarter of his relentless gags may make you laugh. Like its predecessor ""All Saints Day"" will if nothing else be a cult item for Roman Catholic schoolboys; the next sequel blatantly set up should arrive no later than 2019.""The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for bloody violence language and some nudity.THE BOONDOCK SAINTS IIAll Saints DayOpens on Friday nationwide. Written and directed by Troy Duffy based on a story by Troy Duffy and Taylor Duffy; director of photography Miroslaw Baszak; edited by Bill De Ronde and Paul Kumpata; music by Jeff Danna; production designer Dan Yarhi; produced by Chris Brinker and Don Carmody; released by Apparition and Stage 6 Films.

BY Joe Neumaier Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITICS Thursday October 29 2009 517 PM Title Michael Jacksons This Is It4 starsDocumentary-rehearsal footage of the late pop star fine-tuning a performance. At area theaters (151). PG Suggestive dances. For fans wondering whether to see this much-touted documentary-memorial-concert film reportedly only in theaters for two weeks -- take note The late King of Pop delivers.This odd hybrid of a movie -- as much a feat of editing as it is showmanship -- is made up of raw footage filmed earlier this year for what was to be Jacksons final show. Its more effective than a straight-ahead concert movie would have been. To see the 50-year-old pop star working hard in the hopes of sending shivers down a future audiences spine one last time gives closure to the festival of mourning that followed his death last June. Thanks to velvet-smooth postproduction work full performances of ""Thriller"" ""Gonna Be Startin Somethin"" ""Human Nature"" ""Ill Be There"" and ""I Just Cant Stop Loving You"" among others are successfully even movingly culled together. Weeks from death Jackson appears in complete control and often in good humor and executes old and new dance moves stunningly. If concert films by their very nature are artificial events that try to meld a you-are-there quality with a magnified sense of connection between performers and their fans ""This Is It"" benefits from the intimacy of its backstage-rehearsal atmosphere. The film makes up for its grainy look with a terrific sound. In its own quirky way it captures an artist obviously most alive while onstage. (A full review of ""Michael Jacksons This Is It"" ran  on Wednesday.) Joe NeumaierThe Boondock Saints II All Saints Day2 starsSequel about vigilante brothers. At area theaters (157). R Violence language nudity.Those who love good trash have a hero in Troy Duffy whose original ""Boondock Saints"" was just outrageous enough to earn a small but passionate cult. Both movies could be fairly derided as imitation Tarantino a complaint that wont bother fans one bit.Wry Sean Patrick Flanery and bland Norman Reedus return as the MacManus brothers Irish vigilantes determined to safeguard Bostons streets when the cops cant. The sequel adds some flavor with sidekicks Clifton Collins Jr. and Julie Benz both experts at B-movie cheese. (Mafia leader Judd Nelson emotes primarily through flared nostrils.)The only truly ugly side to this self-consciously grimy movie is the streak of Neanderthal humor. Operatic overacting is funny. Racist and homophobic jokes? Not so much.Elizabeth WeitzmanGentlement Broncos1 starComedy about competing versions of a sci-fi tale. At the Sunshine (130). PG-13 Crude humor. Is there no end to the parade of patronizing ""Napoleon Dynamite"" knockoffs? ""Broncos"" may be the worst yet -- perhaps because it was made by Jared Hess the guy responsible for this trend in the first place.Yep Hess wrote and directed ""Dynamite"" and heres proof we shouldnt have rewarded him. The hollow ""Broncos"" is even more cruelly disdainful designed primarily to scorn the pathetic lives within. The only laughs come from Jemaine Clement whos amusing as a sci-fi writer with no qualms about stealing his next story from a teenage fan (Michael Angarano). You can see Clement in the trailer now online; watch that and then rent ""Napoleon"" if youre really in the mood to laugh at losers drowning in their own quirks. Elizabeth WeitzmanLabor Day2 starsDocumentary about how the service workers union played a part in the 2008 presidential election. At the Quad (116). With Barack Obama John McCain. Unrated.Director Glenn Silbers look at how window washers public employees janitors and other working men and women played a role in 2008s political events is heartening and yet a year after being filmed unintentionally aggravating. As the various primary candidates courted the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) we watch Barack Obama John McCain and their Democratic and Republican rivals participate in the unions ""Walk a Day in Our Shoes"" program see various states groups grill candidates and hear why the people who make up this countrys backbone invested so much in that election specifically and Obama in particular. Though its viewpoint is straightforward and partisan listening to the service workers anticipate great change is a reminder that a year after that historic November a lot of distractions and obstructions are keeping many of their goals from being met. J.N.Skin3 starsA couple in apartheid-split South Africa insist their black daughter is in fact white. At the Sunshine Cinema and the Beekman (147). PG-13 Sexuality violence. This unadorned but affecting drama about Sandra Laing who attracted media attention in the 1950s when her white parents fought the South African system suffers from a one-note script but still does right by its tricky subject. As Sandra (played affectingly as an adult by Sophie Okonedo) suffers the indignities of South African apartheid in the 1960s and 70s her mother (Alice Krige) and stern father (an intense Sam Neill) insist that Sandra the middle of their three children is like them white. But her appearance classifies her as black until policy change states familial descent will dictate the barriers of South Africas government-sanctioned racism. Life forces Sandra to make her own choice splitting her from her father. Director Anthony Fabians low-key style is admirable and Okonedos beautiful careworn face is heartbreaking. A little more variation in the script though might have yielded something truly great.J.N.

ALL tats and tribes and artery-opening vengeance the sequel to 1999s ""The Boondock Saints"" is a throwback picture that returns you to the late 90s when every third filmmaker thought he was the next Quentin Tarantino. The murderous brothers the Saints (Sean Patrick Flanery Norman Reedus) a self-appointed team of scumicidal warriors return from the Ireland hideout they share with their dad (Billy Connolly) to Boston this time to avenge the death of a priest whose murder was made to look like a standard Saints job. Back in Chowderville a Southern FBI agent (Julie Benz of ""Dexter"") knows they didnt do it because ""Im so f - - - in smart I make smart people feel like they are retarded."" You wouldnt call ""The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day"" a taut thriller. More like a fleshy messy jangled frenzy of shootouts and much discussion about the mechanics of romantic entanglements that bloom between prison inmates. ""Does this make me look gay?"" asks one guy a Mexican sidekick (Clifton Collins Jr.) who has an eye for some festively multicolored revolvers. No. Directing a movie packed wall-to-wall with buff shirtless guys kinda does though. Youd have to go to a chick flick like ""The Time Travelers Wife"" to find an equal amount of bare he-man hide. Among the pleasingly ridiculous bits is a raving Judd Nelson as a gangster leader who smacks a henchman in the chops with a giant salami. Theres also a more welcome cameo by Peter Fonda who despite his Godfather routine is the most restrained actor in sight -- but by the time he checks in the movie is a blur of deranged plotting and surplus villains. With a little simplification (instead of a lot of work put into setting up another sequel) the movie could have been an average albeit trashy and senseless action picture. (Why would a guy who wants information out of another guy hand him a pistol so they can both play Russian roulette?) In one of many elbow-in-the-ribs moments Romeo the sidekick spends several minutes huddling with a janitor trying to come up with a cool one-liner to punctuate the mayhem. The one he comes up with -- ""Who ordered the whupass fajitas?"" -- says so much. Sometimes stupid can be endearing. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Sting Obama best person to handle worlds mess Read Next Sting Obama best person to handle worlds mess Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46913 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 19317 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18669 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day; The Fall - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-West HollywoodMOVIE REVIEWS The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day; The FallOctober 30 2009|Robert Abele; Kevin Thomas Troy Duffy went from a bartending screenwriter to Harvey Weinsteins golden boy in the 90s with his calling-card script ""The Boondock Saints"" -- a brash action comedy about twin vigilantes. His resulting bad-behavior flameout in Hollywood was humiliatingly turned into a cautionary documentary (""Overnight""). But the best revenge is a fan base. ""Saints"" took off on home video. Now 10 years later Duffy has reemerged with a sequel ""The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day"" reuniting Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) with their guns bickering vengeful streak and Boston mob dealings after an Irish sojourn with their hit man dad (the ever-shaggy Billy Connolly).Time may have healed some of Duffys wounds but it hasnt made him a better Tarantino knockoff unfortunately. He tamps down his best instincts -- occasional wry humor and the appealingly oddball supporting character (Willem Dafoe last time a bug-eyed Clifton Collins Jr. here as the MacManus admiring Latino cohort) -- and doubles up on his worst homophobic gags tedious 90s-era slo-mo shootouts and overwrought gangster tropes. Props to him for attempting a female character but in Duffys hands Julie Benzs sultry stiletto-heeled FBI investigator is mostly a garishly lit alien being hopelessly crashing the aggro-fest.--Robert Abele --""The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day."" MPAA rating R for bloody violence language and some nudity. Running time 1 hour 57 minutes. In general release.--The Fall marks a glum debutWith ""The Fall"" writer-director John Krueger buries a promising neo-noir plot with ponderous pacing and uneven performances and dialogue. It centers on two brothers bound by a terrible secret in their childhood who have taken widely divergent paths. Frank (Scott Kinworthy) is a judge with a ruthless glamorous wife (Erica Shaffer) and gubernatorial ambitions. Younger brother Tony (Benny Ciaramello) is a high school dropout and recovering drug addict who is wrongly accused of murdering a priest. Frank resigns from the bench to defend Tony but that is not enough to persuade his brother to disclose the alibi that will prove his innocence.Ciaramello and Kinworthy generate considerable passion and intensity as Frank struggles to get Tony to speak up while Tony digs in and resists all the more. But their escalating conflict and anguish are not enough to offset the overall slackness and ineptness of the film from the first-time writer-director. To her credit the assured and imaginative Shaffer makes her wicked wife amusing in this otherwise glum movie.--Kevin Thomas --""The Fall."" Unrated. Running time 1 hour 58 minutes.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + It was 10 years ago that Troy Duffy a nobody from nowheresville (all right a Los Angeles bartender originally from New England) got his break when Miramax bankrolled his little Boston-set gangster movie. Then a documentary called ""Overnight revealed Duffy to be an abusive on-set monster. Then Miramax dumped him. Then he regrouped and made the movie on half the original budget.The twist? ""The Boondock Saints turned out to be unwatchable. The twist on the twist? It found a raging cult audience anyway.Thats all the back story you need for ""The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day a sequel you didnt ask for but somebody must have. And the surprise is that Duffy apparently spent the last decade learning about filmmaking - little things like where to put the camera and how to structure a scene for baseline coherence. The result isnt art but it is an improvement a scurrilous lowdown sub-Tarantino action comedy that unlike the original doesnt make you want to claw your eyes out. Hows that for praise?A recap In the first ""Boondock Saints moronic but civic-minded Irish American twin brothers Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus) MacManus waged holy war on Bostons Italian gangsters with the undercover help of a gay FBI agent (Willem Dafoe) and a hit man who turned out to be the twins long-lost father (Billy Connolly). Were the MacManuses saints or sinners? The people of Boston couldnt make up their minds and neither could the movie.Dafoe is out of the picture in ""All Saints Day but Connolly is still around his gray locks flowing like Jehovahs. He and the boys are living in placid Irish exile when a priest turns up dead in Boston murdered in the brothers signature style. Someone wants them back and back they come picking up a hyperactive third wheel named Romeo as a partner during a bare-knuckle bout on a container ship. Clifton Col lins Jr. plays this character like Speedy Gonzalez on crack trying by sheer force of will to break through racist insult to comic inspiration. He almost makes it.For most of its running time ""All Saints Day plays like a boozy amiably foulmouthed remedial school reunion Here are the three stoogelike Boston detectives (Bob Marley Brian Mahoney and David Ferry) who aid the brothers; heres the ghost of Rocco (David Della Rocco) the first movies third wheel; heres doddery old Gerard Parkes reprising his bit as a bartender with Tourette syndrome. The Southie accents feel right even if the movie was filmed (like most of the original) in Toronto.New characters include Julie Benz as an FBI agent with preposterous motivation and an even more preposterous Southern drawl Peter Fonda as a mysterious mob figure and - up from the Brat Pack dead the hardest working man in direct-to-DVD ladies and gentlemen - Judd Nelson. Nelson plays the top Mafioso in Boston so scared of the MacManuses he lives in a panic room and he still overacts like he just snorted a gram of powdered Brando up his cavernous nostrils.Occasionally the movie cribs from ""The Godfather Part II - even a cat can look at a king - with flashbacks of Connollys character in his apprentice hit man days. To his credit Duffy doesnt embarrass himself with the period ambiance or the action sequences; that theyre functional represents something of a triumph. ""All Saints Day still feels like it was edited with a hacksaw and the crude comic dialogue still scrapes along the barroom floor but the general vibe is one of relaxed murderous high spirits and the movies hardly ever smug.Why should it be? Troy Duffy proved long ago that you can make an absolutely terrible film and still find an audience. ""The Boondock Saints II is a reward for the faithful and no one else an inside joke that ultimately may be on us outsiders who never played along.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Both the cult-canonized MacManus brothers and director Troy Duffy were just getting started when vigilante tale ""The Boondock Saints"" debuted a decade ago. But fate (in the form of the Columbine shootings) and ego (if behind-the-scenes expose ""Overnight"" is to be believed) intervened sending the movie to DVD heaven and Duffy to director jail. Now he picks up the originals open ending in ""The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day"" which feels larger in scope yet sorely lacking in originality not unlike the 10-years-on reunion special it is. The audience is there yet the limited release suggests a homevid strategy. Considering that die-hard fans made the first ""Boondock Saints"" a must-watch action movie for the college crowd it makes sense that Duffy would craft the sequel with them in mind. As such ""All Saints Day"" focuses less on bringing newcomers up to speed than in injecting all the elements that presumably made the original such a success (including the favorite cast member whose involvement Duffy has publicly denied). The movie opens in the Irish boondocks with brothers Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus) sporting big bushy beards and playing house with Poppa M (Billy Connolly) in their remote hideaway. Though the first movie ended with the trio promising to punish criminals whom the justice system couldnt touch theyve evidently spent the past eight years trying to escape the law themselves. When they hear that their old neighborhood priest has been executed in their signature style -- two gunshots to the back of the head and pennies on the eyes -- the boys hop on the first slow boat back to the States making friends with a feisty Mexican fighter en route (played by Clifton Collins Jr. the brother of casting director Veronica Collins Rooney). The murder may have been a setup but its enough to make the mob nervous that the Saints are back in action leading to the same mix of bumbling comedy and trigger-happy panic that permeated the original. In place of Willem Dafoes gay detective we get his equally over-the-top protege Eunice Bloom (""Dexters"" Julie Benz) introduced via extreme closeup of her stiletto heels and exaggerated walk echoing her mentors philosophy that the best special agents dress like tranny hookers. She also shares his crime-scene m.o. plugging her ears and re-orchestrating the events for the benefit of the three goofy detectives who aided the Saints in the first film (through a projection error this scene as well as the end credits were cut short at the screening reviewed). Duffy is a capable enough director but no visionary -- the blue-collar version of guys like John Woo and Quentin Tarantino (who werent exactly highbrow to begin with) mixing self-conscious theatrics with the corniest of vulgar un-PC dialogue. What the ""Boondock Saints"" series delivers -- and the ending makes it perfectly clear we can expect more of them -- is a reliably stylish action-packed experience that reinforces the straight white fratboys view of himself as top of the food chain. Collins character is an excuse for off-color Mexican jokes and Duffy doesnt seem to recognize how including gratuitous rear nudity of the two male leads might contradict the ""not in a gay way"" qualifiers his characters are constantly making. Of course theres an appeal to such above-the-law rule-breaking and the pic feels like a throwback to the likes of ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Shaft."" But Duffys delusions of grandeur extend even further with ""All Saints Day"" serving as his ""Godfather Part II"" complete with Coppola-lite flashbacks to the incident that launched Poppa Ms score-settling career. Its all meant to come together in a big confrontation with a sinister Mafia puppetmaster called ""the Roman"" whose identity is not revealed until the end but Peter Fondas presence made little impression on viewers at a UCLA screening while his accent merely underlined the miscasting (was Christopher Walken not available?). The films style mirrors that of the original which was already late to the ""Reservoir Dogs"" ripoff party and feels doubly dated now with Duffy still relying on his old trick of cranking up the heavy metal and techno music to boost excitement. Action has evolved past the slow-motion two-guns-blazing approach seen here though it is refreshing to take in stunts without the distraction of shaky cameras and hyperkinetic cutting.

To his credit not only did Duffy get his 1999 crime thriller made for less than half of the Weinsteins promised budget but its crippled release still found an excitable cult following from VHS to Blu-Ray. Here then is the inevitable sequel and if you dont already know about the devout Irish Catholic twins McManus (Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery) who deliver vigilante justice to Bostons underworld with the help of a rogue FBI Special Agent dont sweat it Thats also the plot of Boondock Saints IIs childish daydream. Willem Dafoes gay fed is out replaced by his sexed-up protegee Julie Benz and the Saints are joined by Clifton Collins Jr. as a goofy but loyal Latino brawler who helps them find a mysterious priest killer and tries to look bad-ass while walking in slow motion. John Woo outgrew stylizing movies like this in the 90s but Duffy is still chasing his perfect slide-and-shoot except now with more self-satisfied posturing awkward pop-culture referencing casual homophobia and racism and the most vulgar co-opting of religious iconography this side of Dan Brown.
