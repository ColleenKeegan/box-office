With her seductive and lightly anarchic directorial debut Drew Barrymore strongarms her way into Austins underground roller-derby scene to tell the familiar tale of an underdogs rise to sporting eminence. The sport itself makes little sense to the casual onlooker (its female-only full-contact and involves charging around an oval-shaped roller rink on skates and looking mean) but the film is saved by the sincerity of its tone and the richness and variety of its ensemble cast - from Juliette Lewiss hotshot banshee Iron Maven to Kristen Wiigs nurturing Maggie Mayhem and Barrymores borderline psychotic Smashley Simpson. And deftly moderating her patented eye-rolling poseur shtick Page delivers her most charismatic and least divisive performance to date as Bliss Cavendar aka Babe Ruthless.Taken as a florid celebration of female solidarity the film is commendable if hardly radical. But in the final reel following a sappy my-first-boyfriend subplot and much indie- rock name-dropping the focus shifts to examine Blisss increasingly fractured relationship with her fusty parents and a more discerning and emotionally substantial film emerges. Marcia Gay Harden as Blisss ex-beauty-queen mother shimmers in the background desperate for her daughter to realise her potential but also quietly devastated at the prospect of losing her to the big bad world. Its a much needed oasis of quiet heartbreak amid the exhilarating cavalcade of sweaty roller girls.

Its refreshing to see a film where female characters dont have to be portrayed as size zero or ""put together"" or expert asassins to be considered strong acceptable women. Bliss has more kick-ass than a thousand Hit-Girls.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 16 2010Richy RichFeaturedI cannot believe this got four stars. It was quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Facile formulaic movie-making of the very worst kind with nothing to recommend it. I will not go to another drew Barrymore directed film ever. The script could have been written by a 12 year old and was so predictable - with every movie cliche ticked off - you could almost say the lines before the actors did. As for the action scenes - laughably lacking in an kind of authenticity. Your reviewer - David Jenkins - should be relieved of his position. Unbelievable.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 7 2010DickyFeaturedIs there a connection between free cinema tickets on Wednesdays (courtesy of Orange) and aEURoeBaEUR movies released on the same day? Maybe. More telling is the story that Drew Barrymore supposedly got so merry last October that she couldnaEUR(tm)t attend a showing of this movie at a film festival in Toronto aEUR"" the story goes she cried off with the excuse she had a sore throat. All legitimate IaEUR(tm)m sure but not a good sign for your directorial debut. The movie storylineaEUR(tm)s simple Young girl wants to break free from slightly control-freak mother and living in a deathly quiet town so deceives everyone and attends rollerball a few towns away while supposedly doing extra study. Needless to say sheaEUR(tm)s kinda geeky and picked on. But the film goes on to show her mastering rollerskating and becomes the team mascot cum pin-up girl. This filmaEUR(tm)s really girl power on skates. And the storyaEUR(tm)s easily told in an hour. That it then stretches on for another hour. Sure itaEUR(tm)ll make you chuckle once or twice. Unfortunately Drew Barrymore sends up her character with endless pratfalls which become increasingly over-acted. And the team coach aEUR"" aEURoeRazoraEUR is just as over-acted as Barrymore. Elsewhere thereaEUR(tm)s some not bad acting but this film is too long for its own good. Sorry Time Out I donaEUR(tm)t agree aEUR"" this is not a 4 star movie. 4 star movies (like aEURoeThe Hurt LockeraEUR) win 6 Oscars. aEURoeAvataraEUR was rated as 2 stars by Time Out and went on to win 2 Oscars. Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for aEURoeThe Blind SideaEUR this year aEUR"" and it was rated a 2 star movie. aEURoeWhip ItaEUR isnaEUR(tm)t going to win Oscars. Given it was shown at film festivals last autumn if it was that good a movie it would have been released in time to get included in the Oscar nominations just gone. This is really a made for TV movie. If I were you if someone offers you a ticket do what Drew Barrymore did aEUR"" say you have a sore throat or if youaEUR(tm)re forced to go take some Beechams powders to ease the pain of the second hour. Like I say if 2 star movies win Oscars then this is a 1 star movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 18 2010TinloneFeaturedI watched this in HKG with my friend and we both laughed so hard.

(Fox Searchlight) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 1 2009 507 PM Title The high-spirited story of an underdog who makes good Drew Barrymores ""Whip It"" looks a lot like your average sports flick. At heart however its that happiest of surprises a multiplex movie that genuinely respects its young audience.The conflict between surface and soul is one of the movies primary themes. And first-time director Barrymore -- famously raised within Hollywoods twisted vision of girlhood -- found the ideal material in Shauna Cross feisty coming-of-age tale. Barrymore discovered another soul mate in Ellen Page (""Juno"") who proves utterly endearing as Texas teen Bliss Cavendar. Itching to escape her small town Bliss spends her days trudging through high school commiserating with her equally miserable best friend (Alia Shawkat) and despising the beauty pageants her mother (Marcia Gay Harden) insists she enter.Everything changes when she goes to a roller derby match in Austin. Awed by the rock n roll force of the event she impetuously returns for tryouts and miraculously makes the team.She knows shes taking a risk every time she sneaks off to Austin but she cant stop. Her teammates the Hurl Scouts introduce her to a whole new world; theyre independent and funny and especially on skates ferocious. For Bliss whose mother obsesses over the perfect ball gown its a revelation.Sos the movie in its own small way. Yes the story is completely conventional. And its true that the performances run the gamut from awkward (Zoe Bell) to awesome (Kristen Wiig). But everyone -- including Barrymore playing an extra-violent Hurl Scout -- seems to be having a blast with a fierce Juliette Lewis as Bliss rival leading the pack. Besides sometimes its better to make the right movie within a genre than to tackle something out of your range. Barrymore knows both her limits and her values and to her credit stays true to each.Too many films geared toward young women casually undercut them in ways that are alternately lazy and cruel. You wont find any of that here -- just a giddy blast of girl power that races confidently around the track while hip-checking Hollywoods worst tendencies.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Whip It Dramedy. Starring Barrymore and Ellen Page. Directed by Drew Barrymore. (PG-13 111 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ""Whip It"" has nothing to do with either sadomasochism or 80s New Wave unless you count all the hot babes in fishnet inflicting pain in the name of pleasure. Theyre roller-derby skaters and theyre an entertaining bunch even when they arent jabbing elbows or jerking off clothes to flash their injuries. Drew Barrymores first go at directing has all the grit and guts of a regulation sports movie but it also has an honest warmth to it. It also has Ellen Page. The hip preggers high-schooler of ""Juno"" is much celebrated for her quirky volubility as well she should be. Yet her real gift is her eyes which are sad and comprehending beyond her years; theyre the eyes of a young person playing catch-up with her true age. Maybe when shes 60 theyll match the rest of her. But for now shell have to content herself with youthful heroines reaching a little too hard and a little too fast for adulthood. In ""Whip It"" she plays Bliss Cavendar a Texas 17-year-old with a kind schlubby dad (Daniel Stern) a mom (Marcia Gay Harden) obsessed with beauty pageants and an unremunerative waitressing job at a barbecue joint. Bliss wants and needs something desperately but she doesnt know quite what. Imagine her shock - everyones shock - when it winds up being roller derby a hell-on-wheels contact sport known for its hard-charging skaters and femme-chismo ethic. Outfitted with new skates a new boyfriend (Nashville singer-songwriter Landon Pigg) and a brawny new alias (Babe Ruthless) shes soon whipping around the rink with her rough-and-tumble teammates (Kristen Wiig and Zoe Bell plus Barrymore as a brawler called Smashley Simpson). Theres a coach in embarrassing cut-offs (Andrew Wilson); there are nasty-licious rivals (Juliette Lewis as Iron Maven); theres some glimmer of hope for a winning season. There are also plenty of lessons to be learned in the process chiefly about selfishness self-empowerment and familial love. Plus boys. Barrymore and Shauna Cross (who adapted her own novel) work the formulas for underdog sports flicks and black-sheep teen comedies with great skill but no great innovation relying on the usual tropes and plot turns. Yet the movies tough-chick vim and spunky humor keep things rolling along with a fun bruising energy. And its sweet. For all the hip checks and bloody noses it doesnt have a mean bone in its body. -- Advisory Sexual content crude dialogue language and drug material.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 01 2009 236PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Whip It Directed by Drew Barrymore Written by Shauna Cross Starring Ellen Page Kristen Wiig and Marcia Gay Harden Classification PG Whip It is the directorial debut from Drew Barrymore and in many ways its what you might expect from watching the actresss onscreen performances over almost three decades Boisterous cloying simultaneously raunchy and innocent hip and klutzy. The movie is also a showcase for contemporary roller derby with its all-female post-punk campy aesthetic adding up to a welcome variation on the conventional girl teen movie as prom dresses and first kisses are traded in for knee pads and hip checks. Adapted by former roller-derby skater Shauna Cross from her own teen novel the story of Whip It is essentially The Hannah Montana Movie  but with sex violence tattoos and an alt-rock soundtrack. Once again a high-school girl leads a double life in and out of showbiz amidst romance and lots of sisterly squeals and bonding. Ellen Page beguiling with long hair and oversized specs plays 17-year-old Bliss Cavendar who lives with her easy-going dad (Daniel Stern) and beauty pageant-obsessed mom (Marcia Gay Harden) in the flea-sized town of Bodeen Tex. After a life-changing encounter with some rough-and-tumble roller-derby gals from the Austin-based team The Hurl Scouts Bliss hears the call of the wheels. Progressing rapidly she goes from a street klutz in Barbie skates to star of the show in a scene or two while hiding her new career under the auspices of studying for college entrances or working with her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat) at the Oink Joint diner. The first thing that strikes you about casting the diminutive Ellen Page in a roller-derby movie is built-in trepidation You fear she might get squashed like a baby bird under a cinder block. Crosss script makes some allowance for the improbability Though she skates under the name Babe Ruthless Bliss is more an evader than a slammer capable of slipping around her brawnier rivals. Not that the other cast members are especially scary apart from their names. Theres Saturday Night Live s Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem (screenwriter Crosss moniker when she skated); Barrymore as the injury-prone Smashley Simpson; singer Eve as Rosa Sparks (yes the sole African-American trailblazer); and Juliette Lewis as Blisss aging arch rival Iron Maven. Adding some muscle are stunt woman/actress Zoe Bell as Bloody Holly and a couple of real-life skaters from L.As Derby Dolls league Kristen Adolfi and Rachel Piplica as the reputedly violent Manson Sisters a double nod both to the California death cult and the Hanson Brothers of George Roy Hills Slap Shot . The circus-like world of Blisss new roller-derby family also includes some ancillary dudes including the shaggy coach Razor (Andrew Wilson brother of Owen and Luke); Jimmy Fallon as a clownish horn-dog rink announcer and Landon Pigg as Oliver the lanky indie-rock singer who becomes Blisss romantic interest. On the rink the action scenes are only mildly rambunctious - more in the girl-bonding spirit of A League of Their Own than the widescreen action of Raquel Welchs camp classic Kansas City Bomber . In its final third the movie shifts tone as Page shows off her dramatic chops in a succession of one-on-one scenes with her Mom her Dad her friend Pash her unreliable boyfriend and her big sister confidant (Wiig). Page is typically impressive but underchallenged by formulaic material. After a while you really start itching for Babe Ruthless to get out there and hit somebody.

Bliss and younger sister Shania are pageant contestants in a state -- Texas -- that loves its pageants. Bliss mom Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden) has her oldest daughters goal set when the movie opens Win the Miss Bluebonnet crown. When Bliss spies a group of derby skaters her ambitions veer. Bliss follows her well bliss which doesnt mean she wont make mistakes. The movies message is articulated succinctly. When the star-struck teen approaches a group of derby skaters one named Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig) tells her ""Put your own skates on. Be your own hero."" Soon Bliss is making trips to nearby Austin from semi-rural Bodeen and lying to her parents a bit too much for a good kid. Barrymores embrace of gal power is joyful. The skaters are gutsy goofy or both. They own their own odd sexiness. And female friendship is treated as liberating. It also provides sanctuary. Best friends Bliss and Pash waitress at the Oink Joint in Bodeen. They have each others backs -- and when they dont it matters. Alia Shawkat makes us care about Pashs dreams just as much as those of Bliss. Shauna Cross adapted her novel for the screen and kept things smart and nuanced. For instance parents arent enemies or soul crushers. They are people whove made their own complicated bargains on the way to adulthood. Harden and Daniel Stern deliver fulsome portraits of imperfectly perfect -- i.e. loving -- parents. Plenty of the easy chuckles come from the names the Hurl Scouts and their rivals take for themselves. Ramp;B performer Eve and stuntwoman extraordinaire Zoe Bell play teammates with names a little too good to spoil here. But the monikers were inspired by handles like Janis Choplin Judy Gloom and Condoleezza Slice. Barrymore takes a conventional genre -- the sports underdog flick -- and tweaks it in just the right places. Scenes of Bliss ""training"" on the streets of Bodeen are as adorable as they are invigorating. If Hurl Scouts coach Razors delivery has hints of Owen Wilsons slacker cadences thats because hes played by Wilson bro Andrew in one of his funniest turns. A butch softy Razor takes coaching seriously even if his girls just want to have fun. The rink action takes place in a big barn of a place in Austin the town where roller derby was allegedly reborn in 2000. (Denver has its own league the Denver Roller Dolls.) Juliette Lewis is Iron Maven the reigning queen of the rink. Looking not unlike Steve Tyler of Aerosmith (nearly as cool as it is scary) shes a meanie nemesis to the leagues new ingenue. Singer-songwriter Landon Pigg plays rocker Oliver whom Bliss meets on one of her clandestine trips to Austin. Their courtship is swoony yet believable. Its also not without bumps and consequence. ""Whip It"" is steadfastly wise about how the relationships that shape Bliss -- the parents the best friend the boyfriend -- dont do the whole job. Shes still required to put on her skates enter the fray take her knocks. And yes give a few -- in the spirit of good clean fun of course. ""WHIP IT.""

Darren Michaels/Fox Searchlight Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Drew Barrymores directorial debut is a larky and ultimately disposable entertainment about a shrinking violet Ellen Pages Bliss Cavendar who becomes the roller derby teen star ""Babe Ruthless."" Page isnt in her precociously wised-up ""Juno"" mode here which is all to the good. (That act was growing old.) Flying around the track in her battle gear giving as good as she gets Page is a pixie powerhouse. Barrymore who also plays one of the rollers relies too much on conventional ways of shooting and telling the story. The derby sequences are just OK and the conflict between Bliss and her uncomprehending parents played by Marcia Gay Harden and (a fine) Daniel Stern is so predictable that you wish someone had rolled onto the set to whip it into shape.

Comments click to enlarge Whip It Critics Choice 2009 With its hipster irony butch posing and blue-collar affectation the postfeminist fad for womens roller derby doesnt seem to promise much more onscreen than a goofy exploitation quickie. But this comedy about a Texas high schooler (Ellen Page) who reinvents herself as ""Babe Ruthless"" and becomes the star of an Austin league is a surprisingly credible coming-of-age story. Drew Barrymore making her directing debut never allows her eccentric bad girls (among them Kristen Wiig Juliette Lewis and Barrymore herself) to stray into caricature and the heroines conflict with her conventional parents (Daniel Stern Marcia Gay Harden) is warm and credibly handled. (Watching Page and Harden work together is a particular treat.) The skaters may pride themselves on being as brutal as the guys but Barrymores accomplishment lies in putting this across with such a gentle touch.

Think of it as Juno laces up and joins the roller derby.Drew Barrymore left Ellen Page and Kristen Wiig star in Whip It.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Oct. 2 2009Ellen Page Drew Barrymore Juliette Lewis Kristen Wiig Marcia Gay Harden and Andrew Wilson. Directed by Drew Barrymore. 151 minutes. At major theatres. PGWhip It Drew Barrymores fledgling outing as a director stars Ellen Page in an engaging affirming tale thats more sk8r grl saga than hell-on-wheels ride. Think of it as Juno laces up and joins the roller derby.Despite a thin predictable script courtesy of Shauna Crosss source novel Derby Girl theres something very likeable about Whip It and its strong sometimes goofily sweet female cast especially the way they all roll together. Theres also enough down-and-dirty derby action to satisfy and a wide-ranging rocking soundtrack - which includes Landon Pigg who makes a less-than-impressive movie debut as Pages love interest - to keep things rolling.Halifax-born Page is adorable as clever and quirky small-town Texan Bliss Cavendar. She may only be 17 but Bliss knows she wants more out of life than reliving her mothers faded-past dreams of beauty pageant glory. In a return to Juno MacGuff territory - minus the pregnancy and some of the sass - Bliss is a serious aimless social misfit whos too smart for her tiny town. By day shes in high school and night and weekends shes toiling at the local barbecue pit the one with the big pig on the roof.Article Continued BelowIn between her mom (Marcia Gay Harden) grooms her for the Miss Bluebell Pageant an event Bliss approaches like one making the long walk to the gallows. Once she sees some rough-and-ready roller derby gals in action - teams like the Fight Attendants and the Black Widows - tearing it up in a warehouse in nearby Austin Bliss eagerly chooses the track over tiaras.These tattooed and tough skaters also have their soft side and at the urging of maternal type Maggie Mayhem (Kristin Wiig) Bliss straps on her Barbie wheels and learns to skate.The only thing in Blisss way is her age (you need to be 21 to sign up) and getting around her parents. Crafty lies take care of both. Since Bliss is so darned endearing we cant fault her for either if it helps her end up as Babe Ruthless the newest member of the Hurl Scouts.The sassy names these high rollers adopt form a running gag in the flick - such as the hopeful who announces her derby handle is ""Jabba the Slut.""Babe Ruthless morphs into an aggressive derby doll who can more than keep up with teammates Bloody Holly (Zoe Bell) Rosa Sparks (Eve) and the delightfully vague party maniac Smashley Simpson (Barrymore).Meanwhile Bliss relies on the support of her best friend Pash (Arrested Developments Alia Shawkat) and finds romance with a cutie named Oliver (Pigg).The Hurl Scouts seem content to be in the league basement much to the chagrin of their determined oddball coach Razor (Andrew Wilson the Wilson brother who got the acting talent in the family). Thats not the plan for Iron Maven the top skater with the Holy Rollers whos out to give the young upstart Bliss her comeuppance. Casting Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers; Cape Fear) as the just-this-side-of-crazy Maven was genius. After a three-year hiatus to work on her musical career its good to see the talented Lewis back onscreen a standout in a sea of strong females.Whip It does best when it hones in on the skating sisterhood and the changing challenging relationship between Bliss and her mother reminding us of a universal truth When an enforcer named Black Eyed Skeez sends you flat on your ass get up and skate.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Who else could show up to the Toronto premiere of her first directorial effort the roller derby-themed film Whip It with a hair-do that looked like something put together by a bored Jolie-Pitt child during an unsupervised hour at the chateau? If this were Lindsay Lohan Dr. Phil would be calling for an intervention but when Barrymore dips the last two inches of her electrocuted-looking blonde bob into skunk black we assume her motive was not pretension or looming personal disaster but rather some sort of unabashed joy we may not share but which we can appreciate. Whip it is a lot like that hairstyle. Even if a tale of female empowerment through roller derby is not your particular cup of tea Barrymore delivers it with such a giddy good sense of fun that its easy enough to go along with. Moreover she emerges as a sensitive director who despite a tendency to make some overly romantic choices knows how and when to let an emotional moment linger on the screen. (See pictures of the youngest best actress Oscar nominees.) The movie based on screenwriter Shauna Cross novel Derby Girl is set in the heart of small-town Texas where a high school senior and part-time barbeque joint waitress Bliss Cavendar (Junos Ellen Page) is doing her best to please her mother Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden). Brooke a faded beauty queen would like her two daughters (Bliss is the older sister) to follow in her footsteps in the pageant world and then after the triumph of coronation go on to some greater future that while undefined does not mimic her own fate of settling down with an amiable husband (Daniel Stern) in a shoe-box of a house to raise children between shifts at the Bodeen post office. Having Bliss become a queen of the Austin roller derby circuit certainly wasnt on Brookes agenda either. But while mother and daughters are enjoying a girls outing to a clothing/head shop in Austin -- ""pretty vases"" Brooke says approvingly to a case full of bongs -- a trio of tattoo-ed and pierced women roll in on skates mugging maniacally as they pass out flyers for the next weekends derby. Most teenage girls would have taken refuge from these R. Crumb-style creatures behind the Doc Martens display but not Bliss. She is enraptured. (See the top 10 female sports heroes.) The next thing you know shes riding the Bingo bus from Bodeen to Austin to practice with her new team the Hurl Scouts. They all have names that sound like Blind Vices from Ted Casablancas E columns Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig) Rosa Sparks (Eve) Bloody Holly (Zoe Bell) and Smashly Simpson (Barrymore cheerfully taking on the role of team idiot). Their coach is Razor and hes played by the third and least well-known Wilson brother Andrew. Juliette Lewis is fairly terrifying as Iron Maven the star player for the Hurl Scouts rival team. The only person who knows what Bliss is up to is her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat) who doesnt mind covering some of her shifts at the Oink Joint either for the sake of the derby or Blisss budding romance with a hipster boy from a band Oliver (played by musician Landon Pigg). ""Its a great name"" Bliss sighs her usual reserve shattered by Olivers protruding hip bones and fervent attentions. ""Yeah if you like wayfaring Dickensian orphans"" Pash says wryly. Her cynicism sets the tone for how we feel about the romance and Barrymores sweetly cheesy direction of two love scenes between Oliver and Bliss one set in what looks like a wheat field and the other in a swimming pool does not dissuade us from this. (See the top 10 fringe competitions.) The arc of the sports movie is such that we know were going to have to sit through some defeats some victories and a championship match which of course turns out to be scheduled for the same night as one of Bliss beauty pageants. Barrymore does a capable job with these action sequences although tiny little Page is not the likeliest of derby contenders and the sport has such a cartoon aspect that it seems about as likely to become a national craze as Barrymores Toronto hair style. But she excels with people. Wiig rapidly proving to be a solid actress and not just a comedian has some memorable scenes as does Shawkat just coming off a radically different role in Amreeka. The relationships between Bliss and both her parents in particular are nuanced and very vivid. In every scene Harden reminds us that she is deservedly an Oscar winner and Page manages to transcend the dangerous trap of her Juno role and make Bliss very much her own person. When Harden and Page are together on screen whether feuding or struggling to understand each other were riveted by the complicated and tender nature of their mother-daughter bond.

Photo GRRLS just wanna have fun -- and boy do they as rough n ready roller derby players -- in ""Whip It"" Drew Barrymores exuberant and totally winning directing debut. Showing her Best Actress Oscar nomination for ""Juno"" was no fluke Ellen Page is tomboyish perfection as Bliss Cavendar a suburban Texas high schooler who chafes at the beauty contests in which her mom (Marcia Gay Harden) keeps entering her. One visit to a roller derby match in Austin and shes found a new home. Bliss who works at a diner sneaks into the city to try out for the Hurl Scouts on her Barbie skates and sure enough she makes the team. Bliss doesnt bother mentioning shes only 16. The Hurl Scouts are an undisciplined bunch -- ""Slap Shot"" is an obvious influence on the film -- with Barrymores cheerfully oblivious character who goes by the nom-de-skate Smashley Simpson being especially prone to injury. As a director Barrymore has cast nearly flawlessly with Juliette Lewis and Kristen Wiig especially good as respectively a bad-girl rival and a supportive single-mother teammate to Bliss who renames herself Babe Ruthless for the matches. The skating scenes are rousingly staged with Page performing one especially impressive jump that brought cheers when the film debuted at last months Toronto International Film Festival. As you might expect from Barrymores long producing career ""Whip It"" is mostly about female bonding and empowerment. One especially well-rendered subplot explores how Bliss newfound interests test her relationship with hometown BFF Pash (Alia Shawkat) who gets busted for underage drinking while waiting for Bliss after a match. Barrymore admirably resists turning Bliss mom into a caricature which most male directors would have done. Bliss sympathetic if weak-willed dad is played by Daniel Stern which underlines the resemblance between Shauna Cross script (from her novel) and ""Breaking Away"" the excellent bicycling movie in which Stern made his debut 30 years ago. Both movies depict a young person on the cusp of finding his or her identity through sports in ways that seem blessedly free of Hollywood artifice and formula. Real-life rocker Landon Pigg is just OK in a subplot about Bliss bittersweet emo-boy first love but Andrew Wilson -- brother of Owen and Luke -- is an absolute hoot as the Hurl Scouts long-suffering coach. Sweet without being sticky and funny without getting silly ""Whip It"" introduces Barrymore as a director with a keen eye a good ear for tone and an inspired touch with actors. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next James Franco to guest star on General Hospital Read Next James Franco to guest star on General Hospital Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46473 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 23647 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 15690 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Whip It | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; whip-it ) Whip It (United States 2009) October 01 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Whip It the directorial debut of actress Drew Barrymore is a sports film that uneasily straddles the divide that exists between comedy and drama. Built upon a mountain of clichA(c)s the screenplay wallows in artificiality and although some of the sports action sequences are well choreographed and have a ring of authenticity nearly every scene away from the arena reeks of contrivance. The lead character isnt remotely believable and the screenplay feels like it went into production while still in the draft stage. The things Whip It does well are overshadowed by its numerous missteps. Whip It is based on Shauna Cross novel Derby Girl a fictional tale that uses incidents and anecdotes from her time spent in professional roller derby. For those unfamiliar with the sport a quick primer is provided in the movie and its easy enough to pick of the basics as things go along. Because many of the in-game instances are based on real-life occurrences the mantle of contrivance that blankets much of the film is absent during these sequences although aspects of the general ""sports movie formula"" apply. (Inept team gels with the addition of a new superstar and goes all the way to the championship game.) Most of the action takes place in and around Austin Texas where the Texas Roller Derby team ""Hurl Scouts"" is based. Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) is a waitress working at a diner in a dead-end town outside of Austin. Bored and desperate to find a way to escape the oblivion of a monotonous life that revolves around school and beauty pageants she hears about a try-out for the Hurl Scouts and attends. Much to her surprise she is successful and ends up joining the likes of Maggie Mayhem (Kristin Wiig) Smashley Simpson (Drew Barrymore) Bloody Holly (Zoe Bell) and Rosa Sparks (Eve) on the team which is coached by a guy named Razor (Andrew Wilson). Bliss who changes her name to the more intimidating ""Babe Ruthless"" loves her new life which comes complete with a rock star boyfriend Oliver (Landon Pigg). But theres a downside that includes a growing separation from her oldest friend Pash (Alia Shawcat) and necessitates lying to her domineering mother Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden) and laid-back father Earl (Daniel Stern). Ultimately Bliss meteoric rise within the roller derby world places her in the cross-hairs of her arch-enemy Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis) in a winner-takes-all game that occurs at the same time as a beauty pageant final in which Bliss is supposed to participate. It would be nice to say that Barrymore brings a sense of energy and authenticity to a script that feels more than merely familiar but that would be untrue. The only instances in which Whip It comes alive are during the sports scenes and late in the proceedings when some of the characters shed their caricature masks and morph into facsimiles of real people. Unfortunately the movie as a whole comes across as a regurgitation of numerous better productions and the unique element of this one - roller derby as the sport - isnt new enough to inspire or excite. Most of the comedy is muted (by intention - this isnt supposed to be an excursion into hilarity) offering the occasional chuckle but not much else. Its hard to say whether Ellen Page is miscast or whether the falseness of the role simply defeats her singular ability as an actress but I never bought into this character the way I did Hayley in Hard Candy or Juno in Juno. Page has some nice scenes including a deliciously nasty one in which she verbally dresses down her parents but shes only moderately credible as Bliss and even less believable when she puts on the pads and helmet and becomes Babe Ruthless. (The latter piece of equipment by the way causes her to resemble the Great Gazoo.) Whip It features a couple of effective supporting performances from Daniel Stern as Bliss supportive father (not unlike J.K. Simmons in Juno) and Kristin Wiig (following Adventureland and Extract) continuing to mature beyond the zany persona that trapped her in many of her early efforts. Barrymore does not force her own character into the spotlight and she finds a part that fits within Juliette Lewis limited range. Sometimes a new director even one with a significant resume in front of the camera steps forward to surprise with a first film. More often than not that isnt the case so no final determinations should be made regarding Barrymores behind-the-camera capabilities based on the failure of Whip It. The movie is too safe and generic; even the best director would be challenged to do much with the material. At its best this could have been a passable distraction and at its worst it could have been unwatchable. Barrymore manages to bring it in somewhere in between those extremes.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> After giving the performance of her career in HBOs Grey Gardens Drew Barrymore tackles another killer challenge directing. The empowerment theme of womens roller derby suits her. Dialing herself back to the supporting role of Smashley Simpson Barrymore focuses on Juno star Ellen Page as a teen Texas BBQ waitress who puts on skates to find her bliss. Bliss is her name by the way later changed to Babe Ruthless. Do you sense cutesiness sneaking in? It does despite skilled actors such as Juliette Lewis as her rival and Kristen Wiig as a fellow Hurl Scout (cute again). Screenwriter Shauna Cross dulls the edges of her novel Derby Girl which the skate action and rockin soundtrack cant disguise. At moments especially in the conflicted intimacy between Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern as Bliss parents Barrymore shows real directing chops. But in Whip It shes painting inside the box.

Scene for scene and beat for beat this roller derby crowd-pleaser crackles with joy and jubilation.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune October 1 2009 -- 718pm Courtesy Darren Michaels / MCT Ellen Page stars in ""Whip It"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Whip It"" is smashing. Scene for scene and beat for beat this roller derby crowd-pleaser crackles with joy and jubilation. Its a rowdy comedy a great date movie a female-empowerment flick guys will love a charming character study an object lesson in finding your path and following your dream. Like ""Rocky"" ""Slap Shot"" and ""Caddyshack"" its an instant classic that transcends its sports-movie roots while grabbing every gold medal in sight. Ellen Page is magically delicious in the role shes been looking for since ""Juno."" She plays Bliss a Texas teen whose mom a onetime beauty queen expects her daughters to carry on the family tradition. Bliss who is happier in funky thrift shop duds than pageant gowns goes along with it. Shes antsy but dutiful just as she is when waitressing at the Oink Joint the local BBQ pit. Shes trying to find herself but her small town doesnt offer many role models. When a catty schoolmate regards her trashy-fun duds she asks if Bliss has gone ""alternative."" ""Alternative to what?"" is her innocent reply. On a shopping trip to Austin she encounters her role models a bevy of fun-loving tattooed skaters distributing roller-derby fliers. Her waitressing pal Pash drives them to the big city on the pretense of a study session for the SAT. The rink is a flurry of fishnet leggings sharp elbows and squealing fun; grrrl power in the flesh. And the ring names Smashley Simpson Bloody Holly Jabba the Slut Bliss is mesmerized tries out and is soon the teams rising star Babe Ruthless. Skating incognito is a juggling act. Bliss has to keep her secret from her folks (pushy Marcia Gay Harden nicely matched with laid-back Daniel Stern) and cadge rides from the supportive but envious Pash. Meanwhile shes massively crushing on scruffy indie-rocker Oliver (Landon Pigg who is a heartbreaker but not boringly conventionally handsome). Thats a lot of story to keep under control and first-time director Drew Barrymore manages the hustle and flow like a maestro. None of the plot lines is underfed; every character comes to the screen fully fleshed. While Bliss has antagonists (Harden is a snappish Mama Bear and Juliette Lewis is formidable as a bully-girl skater) theres not a cardboard villain in sight. Everyone has their reasons. Everything turns out pretty much as youd expect but it gets there in imaginative ways. Young lovers Page and Pigg are fresh and unforced; their cleverly staged swimming pool makeout is breathtaking. Kristin Wiig hip-hop star Eve and Barrymore are fantastic as Pages teammates. Andrew Wilson is gruffly adorable as the teams coach; Jimmy Fallon shines (yes truly) as the sleazoid ring announcer and Minneapolis musician Har Mar Superstar has a ticklish cameo as a rival teams manager. ""Whip It"" is a stupendous hip check to the funnybone. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Like him Barrymore has distinguished herself as an actor and producer. Now with the buoyant comedy Whip It an archetype-busting and delightful roller-derby tale she establishes herself confidently as a director.Her feature debut stars Ellen Page (Juno) as Bliss Cavendar a high school senior from Bodeen Texas where beauty contests and football are civic religions. Bliss mom Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden) mail carrier by day and herself once a pageant princess enters her daughters in the Bluebonnet Pageant coaching them with the take-no-prisoners attitude of Bear Bryant.In prim cocktail dress and pumps Bliss appears to be in drag. Shes more herself in thrift-shop dresses and combat boots. Obviously the pageant world is too restrained for her. It doesnt permit a full range of social and physical expression.When Bliss sees brazen skater-grrls - hair flying and fishnets snagged - roll into a thrift shop she finds her spiritual sisters. For her these hellions on wheels nicknamed Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis) Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig) and Smashley Simpson (Barrymore herself) fearlessly exhibit the free-spirited physicality Bliss hides under taffeta.The derby daredevils dont care that the men in the audience come for the girl-on-girl action. The girls are there because skating allows them to compete and yeah be physically aggressive in the context of contact sport.More intimately than most in Hollywood Barrymore knows how few female types there are on screen. Beyond the good girl and the bad girl (movie versions of the madonna and the whore) there are square pegs. Barrymore puts faces and gives backstories to these nonconformists trying to define themselves before others define them. The chief appeal of the film is to watch Bliss misfit among angelic pageant girls emerge as derby devil Babe Ruthless - sensitive combative girly butch timid and fearless - whisking conflicting femininities into one tasty serving.Working from the autobiographical novel by Shauna Cross Barrymore celebrates a broad cross-section of females. These include blue-collar moms who are pageant ladies (Harden) brainiacs who work in diners (Alia Shawkat) cocktail waitresses who would rather compete at roller derby than perform pole dances (Lewis) tough dames who are tender moms (Wiig) and girls like Bliss who find a social outlet (roller derby) and first love (with an Austin alt-rocker Oliver played by Landon Pigg).Barrymore takes us into the world of these women (and the men who both love and ogle them) diving deep into their emotions. None dare call it girl stuff. Its human stuff. Surprisingly moving is the mother/daughter dynamic between Brooke and Bliss well-played by the irony-free Harden and Page.The first-time filmmaker is a most sympathetic director of all the actors eliciting memorable performances from Wiig Daniel Stern (as Bliss dad) and especially from Lewis as the reigning skate queen resentful of Bliss youth and opportunities. Quite droll is Andrew Wilson - elder brother of Luke and Owen - as the coach who cant get his team to read the playbook. (Less droll is Jimmy Fallon as the rink announcer.)What Barrymore is less good at is the direction of the action sequences which feature the actresses - including Barrymore herself as the punch-drunk Simpson - doing their own skating. (Perhaps an overhead shot or two would have helped clarify the game in which certain players get points for passing blockers from the other team.)Finally though Whip It (which takes its name from a play in which skaters hold hands and form a human whip to propel the last skater forward) is heaven on wheels.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickeyat 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

""Whip It"" Movie Review -- Bliss Cavendar is going nowhere slowly. She has a job at a barbecue joint that requires her to wear an apron with a giant pigs face on it. She has a mother who insists she compete in local beauty pageants. She has a boyfriend who ... well actually no. She doesnt have a boyfriend. So Bliss decides she has to do something fast. After all shes 17. Life is passing her by. So she catches a bus out of her small Texas town to Austin where she tries out for -- and amazingly earns -- a spot on the Hurl Scouts roller-derby team. Whip It (PG-13) Fox Searchlight (111 min.) Directed by Drew Barrymore. With Ellen Page Juliette Lewis Marcia Gay Harden Daniel Stern. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO STARS Rating note The film contains strong language violence sexual situatiosn and substance abuse. Yes ""Whip It"" is actually a modern movie about roller derby. Even more improbably it stars Ellen Page the petite smart-mouthed star of ""Juno"" which is a little like a movie about Michael Cera going for the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Ol Juno MacGuff as a derby queen? Those jocks spit bigger than she is. The gulf between the dream and the reality could be a large part of the humor in ""Whip It."" Unfortunately there isnt much comedy in the movie at all. Instead it just recycles ideas from quirkier indie comedies (the beauty pageants the schlocky minimum-wage jobs) and more mainstream young romances (the ""sensitive"" new boyfriend the follow-your-dream bromides). Its as if Napoleon Dynamite and Little Miss Sunshine strapped on skates and sailed right into some pat Hollywood comedy. Thats too bad because Barrymore -- whos starred in a few pat Hollywood comedies herself -- is making her directing debut here (as well as taking on a small part as one of the derby queens). And youd think after 30 years of being in front of a camera shed have a few novel ideas about what to do behind it. But ""Whip It"" just moves blandly along right up to the inevitable ""gag"" reel under the final credits. The derby scenes are filmed in such tight closeups that we miss out on the plays the women are working so hard to execute; Bliss conflicts with her best friend her new boyfriend and her parents are so obvious they could write themselves. True the derby dames stage names -- ""Bloody Holly"" ""Eva Destruction"" ""Smashley Simpson"" -- are more fun than a roomful of drag queens. The always courageously eccentric Juliette Lewis is terrific as the evil ""Dinah Might"" and after her SNL hamming Kristen Wiig gives a refreshingly restrained comic performance as ""Malice in Wonderland."" But Page never convinces as ""Babe Ruthless"" her teams new star. As her emo boyfriend Oliver Landon Pigg is well just as smoothly charming as his name. And if Barrymore really wanted to do a movie about empowerment -- ""girls getting to do what boys do"" as she told Time Out New York -- why make the teams bossy coach a man? Points go to Lewis for bringing all of her fixed-stare intensity to a typical villainous part and elevating it. And credit is owed to some of the supporting performers including Barrymore who modestly settles for playing one of the lesser athletes. But like the sport itself this movie goes in circles. In the end it hardly matters who wins. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Whip It Fair DirectorDrew Barrymore. Cast Ellen Page Marcia Gay Harden Kristen Wiig Alia Shawkat. Rating PG-13 for sexual content including crude dialogue language and drug material. Related Ellen Page rolls back into stardom This time Barrymores also behind the camera Women of roller derby on right track in Whip It Spotlight Drew Barrymore ""Whip It"" set in the roller-derby subculture of Austin is a sweet coming-of-age comedy safe familiar and comforting. Its a complete mismatch between subject and style but Drew Barrymores directorial debut is not without its charms. Ellen Page the pregnant-teen hipster from ""Juno"" stars as Bliss Cavendar a sorta-spunky 17-year-old whose small-town blues are compounded by her uptight mom (Marcia Gay Harden) whos vicariously reliving her glory days on the beauty-pageant circuit. But Bliss doesnt want to be the Blue Bonnet Queen especially not after she discovers a roller-derby league in Austin where alterna-girls with such names as Iron Maven Bloody Holly and Eva Destruction deliver bone-crunching body checks in fishnet stockings. Bliss hitches a ride with the blue-hairs on the Bingo Bus to try out and faster than you can say ""sports-training montage"" she becomes Babe Ruthless the talented newcomer who just might turn the last-place Hurl Scouts into contenders. The derby girls are a lot of fun especially Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem a down-to-earth single mom and Barrymore as Smashley Simpson a sweet-faced blonde who hits as hard as she parties. And Jimmy Fallon is hands-down hilarious as Johnny Rocket the leagues trash-talking announcer and play-by-play man. Yet for all the raunchy jokes and bloody noses almost everything about this movie feels tentative. The action sequences are oddly lacking in adrenaline and it doesnt help that the petite Page looks like she wouldnt last 30 seconds in a real-life bout. On an emotional level the characters and conflicts feel obligatory and underdeveloped as does Bliss romance with Oliver (Landon Pigg) a lanky rocker who seduces her with his dreamy eyes and bed head. One of the many false notes is their vaguely surreal love scene in which they dive into a swimming pool to make out underwater. They kiss and chase each other and start stripping off their clothes all seemingly without having to rise for air. You half expect a fadeout to the two of them lying back and smoking cigarettes in the nude still 6 feet underwater. But no. Theres nothing nearly that provocative or surprising in ""Whip It"" one giant pulled punch of a movie in which sexy isnt sexual raunchy isnt naughty and violence poses no real danger.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Once in a while a moviemaker will find it in her heart to make my dreams come true. In Drew Barrymores ""Whip It when Juliette Lewis starts a food fight with Ellen Page that turns into about a dozen giggling women rolling around on the floor of a diner covered in condiments grease and cream the movie had won my heart. Did I know this was something I wanted to see? Not really. But the great bait-and-switch of the movies amounts to your dreams being replaced with a directors. And who would have thought that director would be a woman who in her next life seems destined to come back as an energy drink?Barrymore has so thoroughly laced ""Whip It with her own lunatic affections for women and the human race in general that it ought to be sold as an antidepressant. For her first film as a director shes opted not to raid her past for a juicy Hollywood melodrama. Shes given us a roller derby comedy adapted with intelligence heart fairness and some wit by Shauna Cross from her novel ""Derby Girl. Page plays Bliss Cavendar a tomboy dying to get out of a small Texas town whose obsessions - football beauty pageants big hair - dont interest her. (Barrymore actually shot the film in Michigan.)As it happens her mother Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden) has been grooming Bliss and her younger sister for the pageant world. You know this woman is deluding herself to think she could relive her beauty-queen days through a daughter who shows up for one contest with some of her hair dyed blue.Pages eye-rolling and sulking are straight out of ""Juno. But this part is something new for her. One afternoon Brooke takes Bliss to a thrift store in nearby Austin to buy a pair of combat boots when three full-figured women come skating toward the register like tattooed angels from hipster heaven. Pages face lights up in a way Ive never seen. The angels leave behind flyers for a roller derby league and without a lot of effort Barrymore and Page make you feel the earth move beneath this girls feet.The rest of the movie is devoted to capitalizing on that excitement. Bliss and her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat) pretend to Mr. Cavendar (an excellently dopey Daniel Stern) that theyre going to high-school football games. Theyre actually sneaking over to Austin where Bliss tries out for the league and winds up helping to turn around a losing outfit called the Hurl Scouts (""Were number two they chant after one defeat). The team includes a single mom (Kristen Wiig) and a stoner Whole Foods clerk (Barrymore). The rapper Eve and the stuntwoman Zoe Bell are Hurl Scouts too. Beyond their noms de skate (Barrymores is Smashley Simpson Eves is Rosa Sparks Page is Babe Ruthless) we dont learn much about them individually. The point is they have great camaraderie. The matches which are staged on a canted track in an abandoned warehouse arent terribly thrilling as athletic spectacles. (The object is to score points by passing other skaters.) But theyre entertaining. Jimmy Fallon emcees them and hes more charmingly louche here than he is on his new talk show once showing up with giant foam cowboy hat on his head. ""Clean up on aisle 5 he quips after Smashley punches out a skater.Barrymore probably overemphasizes the physical brutality. At one point Bliss goes down and youre worried we might have a ""Million Dollar Baby situation on our hands. But the spirit behind it is sincerely fun in a way thats rarely the case in alternative-sports comedies like say ""Dodgeball ""Balls of Fury or the Will Ferrell movie of your choice. In any of those Juliette Lewis who plays a vamp named Iron Maven would be the villain. Here shes just charismatically competitive as opposed to one-dimensionally heartless. Her harassment of Page is a show of respect When will Bliss fight back? Right there with a dessert in that diner.The movies central drama revolves around how Bliss will reconcile her mothers wishes with her own. Will the cute bamboo shoot of a boy (Landon Pigg) she meets in Austin break her heart? Can her friendship with the college-bound Pash survive Blisss small-time fame? These and other matters are resolved in nicely written smartly acted sequences that show off Barrymores sharp instincts about how to orchestrate her very different performers. She has Harden and Wiig turn their muchness down gives Shawkat enough to do so that the many folks who never saw her on ""Ar rested Development will feel theyve made a robust comic discovery and proves she has good taste in Wilson brothers casting the shaggiest one Andrew to play the Hurl Scouts long-suffering coach.Most crucially Barrymore encourages Page to just let herself go. The sight of her making her way up residential streets in a pair of Barbie roller skates or screaming ""Marco in a game of Marco Polo is simply joyful. If American movies were full of stories about girls their dreams their mothers their heartbreaks their gift for smashing their elbows into peoples chins ""Whip It would be just another happy comedy. But Hollywood is woefully short on such stories. I anticipate the day when a movie like this stops seeming like the antidote and more like the norm.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet After 30 years of growing up on screen Drew Barrymore has generated an almost paternal (or maternal gender depending) reserve of good will thats carried her through the peaks and valleys of her life and career. And shes been increasingly savvy about seizing on that good will too and giving her fans what they want regardless of the varying quality of the films themselves. To that end Barrymores middling directorial debut Whip It is exactly the movie people have come to expect from her a light ingratiating femme-centered ensemble piece with a positive message on empowerment and independence with a romantic-comedy element thrown in because she certainly knows her way around those. Its virtually impossible to hate the film but Barrymores presence behind the camera suggests more calculation than vision; like a lot of actors who direct she tends to the performances but her style never rises above bland proficiency. Bland proficiency might be enough in some cases but Whip It delves into the underground roller-derby scene and the speed violence and sexploitative mayhem associated with the sport really needs to pop. Though conspicuously small for the part--shes supposed to make up in quickness what she lacks in size--Junos Ellen Page gives the film a boost as a waitress in small-town Texas who resists mother Marcia Gay Hardens fixation on raising a beauty pageant queen. After learning of a roller-derby league in a neighboring city Page steals off at night and works her way onto a losing squad flanked by Kristen Wiig Eve Zoe Bell and Barrymore. Under the nom de skate ""Babe Ruthless"" Page quickly becomes a sensation setting up a confrontation with ""Iron Maven"" a rival enforcer played by Juliette Lewis. She also starts dating a would-be indie rocker though that subplot could be shed without anyone really noticing. Working from a novel by Shauna Cross (who also scripted) Barrymore has fun exploring the tough-girl rituals and bonding of the derby circuit but her take on the small-town South is hayseed provincial from the pig-themed diner where Page works to the grotesque pomp of the beauty pageants. Barrymore strands a loaded cast in roles that dont necessarily require their star power but then theyre only a symptom of a film thats too slight to withstand much bloat. Whip It always seems a beat or two behind the action on every front--the jokes the drama and even the brutal stiff-armed takedowns all fall a little flat.

Meanwhile for those who prefer to ease into their roller-derby reintroduction ""Whip It"" - Drew Barrymores directorial debut that stars Ellen Page (""Juno"") Juliette Lewis and Kristen Wiig - opens Friday providing a bit of distance from the visceral smash-bang of the live item. It also has movie stars. A heavy surge of girl-power. And a sense of perfect timing given what appears to be roller derbys international comeback (thousands crammed into a ""Whip It"" event in this citys Dundas Square during the recent film festival temporarily gridlocking midtown). ""Its definitely having a resurgence"" Page said at her onetime hometown film festival where ""Whip It"" premiered ""but its pretty underground. I went to my first match with Drew and was blown away by the whole world theyve created and the theatrics and the passion behind it. But first and foremost that its really a sport. And thats what they care about."" (The Roller Rebels Captain Morgan aka Lauren M. Madonia said the team has gotten tickets to the movie already but is a little concerned because as she put it the real thing actually has rules. ""The girls are questioning what were going to say to fans who come expecting us to beat the crap out of each other."") Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? MoviesTrailer Whip It Action and emancipation But ""Whip It"" is also less about violent action than emancipated girlhood In suburban Texas debutante-to-be Bliss Cavendar (Page) is being groomed by her obsessive- compulsive mother (Marcia Gay Harden) for life as a Southwestern socialite but what she really wants to do is skate - although she doesnt realize it until she sees the Austin-based Hurl Scouts and members Maggie Mayhem (Wiig) Smashley Simpson (Barrymore) and Bloody Holly (Zoe Bell). Bliss takes to the banked rink - as Babe Ruthless - and despite incurring the enmity of Iron Maven (Lewis) skates to glory. The camaraderie the Hurl Scouts cheer of ""Were No. 2"" the fact that getting the boy isnt the be all/end all of existence all make ""Whip It"" a movie with multiple messages. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""When I read the script"" Page said ""the reason I was so excited I was in it was the thought that if I were 12 years old and this movie was coming out I would have been flipping my lid. I would have been so excited largely because I wasnt that female ideal of what the media says we should look like what we should buy this strange idea of what femininity is - makeup doing whatever we can to get the boy and the idea that the body has be this skinny sick-looking thing rather than about strength. I always played sports. I didnt wear eyeliner till I was 17. Anyway I would have lost my mind."" For Barrymore whos been acting since she was a baby the script by first-timer Shauna Cross (based on Cross young-adult novel) was a ""perfect first fit"" partly because shes an actress directing a rink-load of actresses and also because shes female. One scene a rather chaste underwater love sequence between Page and Landon Pigg likely wouldnt have been shot by a male director. imageCaption ""When Im given a love scene I hate acting them out because theyre awkward and weird"" Barrymore said. ""When theyre done well theyre brilliant but I hate doing them myself. So I thought How can I capture the joy of first love make it cinematic make it fluid pun intended. For those who hate it I apologize. Anything you love or hate about the movie is absolutely my fault."" Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Derby diversity What Page Lewis and Wiig found notable about the roller derby scene was its diversity. ""There are so many types of people who get drawn to it"" Lewis said. ""Young old all different body shapes nurses students mothers punk-rock girls."" Wiig said one woman skater she knows is a schoolteacher with tattoos and pink hair. ""When she goes back to work she dyes it back"" she said. ""But thats her derby persona. It allows women to be physical and kick ass but in talking to some of the derby girls they are like family and its not about guys or guys coming to watch; they dont talk about guys. Its their own thing. At the same time they get black eyes and fall and tear their arms open. And rip their stockings. Its awesome."" All of the actresses had to learn to skate. There was even a skating audition. And a bit of bluffery. ""Like any good actor"" Lewis said ""I lied. Oh my God I skate every weekend what are you kidding? I hadnt put on a pair of skates in eight years."" advertisement | advertise on newsday ""I got in really good shape"" Wiig said. ""Then we stopped shooting and I went back to usual."" Screenwriter Kirsten Smith (""Legally Blonde"") who helped mentor Cross and her screenplay and is a producer on ""Whip It"" says that what turned into a five-year project was always about the same thing. ""I think that roller derby is a conduit to power"" she said. ""And self-confidence and self-love and the feeling you can do anything. Its very feminine because of the costumes and its a little bit tough because of the action. In a way you get to be a girls girl and a guys girl and thats really exciting."" In the seminal 1972 sports extravaganza ""Kansas City Bomber"" the bodacious Raquel Welch got jostled hassled mangled and tackled all in delicious slo-mo. (The girl-on-girl action implied and otherwise is considerably less pronounced in Drew Barrymores new ""Whip It."") Directed by Jerrold Freeman and co-starring Kevin McCarthy and Cornelia Sharpe ""KCB"" starred Welch at the peak of her babe-aliciousness which was pretty much the sole purpose of the movie. Skates. Spandex. Hot showers. Rough action. All meant to advertise Welchs shall we say gifts as she portrays a single mom with two kids tying to make it as a pro skater in a world of envious women devious men and banked turns. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""I really like Kansas City Bomber "" said ""Whip It"" star Ellen Page. ""And Raquels male stunt double which I love. But I got more excited by this little girl who played her daughter. I was like This kid is sooo good and Im like Jeez that looks like Jodie Foster. So I Googled it and was like Oh my God it IS Jodie Foster Shes unbelievable."" Foster would go on to do some better-known (and better) movies Welch would make ""Mother Jugs and Speed"" and Freeman would direct Scott Baio in ""The Boy Who Drank Too Much."" Sometimes you crash into the guardrail and sometimes you glide around the rink. There have been other skate-themed films ""Roller Derby Girl"" a 1949 short subject and ""The Fireball"" (1950) starring Raquel Welchs antithesis Mickey Rooney. But after ""Kansas City Bomber"" the best known of the roller flicks is probably ""Unholy Rollers"" the R-rated 1972 feature with Claudia Jennings playing a factory worker who quits to become a roller-derby star. Jennings the 1970 Playboy Playmate of the Year died in a car crash in 1979.

Only here the petite droll feisty Ellen Page-like heroine played by Ellen Page is named Bliss. And her idea of sass while chatting up a cute rocker (Landon Pigg) in this desexualized slow-speed grrrl-power sports fantasy is ""Im Bliss but I could change that."" Bliss does change her name at least at the Roller Derby rink. She sneaks away from her square parents (Marcia Gay Harden as the U.S. Postal Services least likely mail carrier and Daniel Stern as a nice schlub who likes beer) to roll with a sisterly Austin team who call themselves the Hurl Scouts. There she dubs herself Babe Ruthless making up in speed what she lacks in muscled aggression. Shes heck on wheels or so we are asked to believe The rink footage is pretty un-whippy. Even Juliette Lewis playing the films ? designated bad girl and Bliss/Babes nemesis on the rink is more of a cute bee-yotch than a real threat. The movie is Drew Barrymores directorial debut (she also plays fellow Hurl Scout Smashley Simpson) and its clear shes more attuned to grrrlishness than real ? athletic power Smashley is the first to scream ""Food fight"" and the 34-year-old actress leads the charge in kidlike mayhem.

The only thing that keeps Barrymores effort from playing like an American Movie Classics rerun is the soundtrack an alternarock all-skate to which Junos Ellen Page goes round and round an Austin Texas roller-derby rink during her rather sudden rise from klutz-on-wheels to girl-power poster child. Pages beauty queen Bliss Cavendar is ultimately the least interesting character in the film--a more-good-than-bad youth in revolt clashing with an overbearing but well-meaning mom (Marcia Gay Harden) a sweet but disinterested dad (Breaking Aways Daniel Stern) the best friend with big plans (Alia Shawkat) and the mopey-dopey indie rocker who fucks her over (Landon Pigg a singer-songwriter making his um acting debut). Highlights Andrew Wilson as the roller girls coach (ah so theres the Wilson brother who can act) and the roller-derby vets (played especially well by Juliette Lewis and Kristen Wiig) about whom we learn just enough to wish the movie was focused on them instead.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review This Time Its Personal A sublime suburban meltdown from Joel and Ethan Coen. Plus Michael Moore takes his best shot. _ By David Edelstein Published Sep 28 2009 ShareThis (Photo Wilson Webb/Courtesy of Focus Features ) The fourteenth feature of Joel and Ethan Coen A Serious Man is the first that seems vaguely personal which means just outside their ultracontrolled comfort zone I got the feeling they had little idea what they would end up with when they sat down to write. Is it a comedy? A tragedy? Its right on the border a broad Jewish joke that morphs into a jeremiad a tale of woethat keeps you wondering if the punch line when it comes will make you laugh or want to kill yourself or both. In 1967 in suburban Minneapolis a Jewish physics professor named Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is the image of stability His son (Aaron Wolff) is about to be bar mitzvahed his college is on the verge of granting him tenure. But things begin to get strange even David Lynchian. His slobby hapless brother (Richard Kind) moves into his house and spends a lot of time draining a sebaceous cyst. An envelope of money appears on his desk ostensibly (but can he be sure?) a bribe from a Korean student who failed a test. Anonymous letters denigrating his character appear in his colleagues mailboxes. Then his wife (Sari Lennick) breaks the news that she has become close with an older man a widower named Sy (Fred Melamed) and asks for a Jewish divorce a get. Burly obsequious Sy enfolds Larry in a hug and rumbles Such a thing such a thing Were gonna be fine. Fine is what Larry will never be. Godor is it the Coens?is starting to have some fun at his expense. See Also How the Coen Brothers Turned Stuhlbarg Into a Leading Man Stuhlbarg is a stage actor who has been in few films and his face is so ordinary and indistinct behind his glasses its hard to get a read on him. Is he meant to be a funny zhlub like a young Eugene Levy? You wait for cues that never come His visage only tightens his lips pressing together from the effort not to scream. Stricken Larry sits at a lake beside a friend (a luminous Katherine Borowitz) in leg braces. She says Its not always easy deciphering what God is trying to tell you and directs him to seek out the stories of his people handed down for thousands of years. The first rabbi he approaches an earnest young assistant advises Larry to appreciate the beauties of Gods creation and gestures out the window to a remarkably forgettable parking lot. The second middle-aged rabbi relates a parable called the goys teeth that will be savored for millennia by stoned rabbinical students and adds that God owes us nothingthat the obligation goes the other way. There is a third ancient rabbi whose words youll have to hear for yourself. But science is no more soothing than religion. After filling a titanic blackboard from top to bottom to illustrate Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle Larry utters a line that will enter the lexicon Even if you cant figure it out youre still responsible for it on the midterm. A Serious Man is the Coens true follow-up to their adaptation of Cormac McCarthys No Country for Old Mena Jewish take on the question of cosmic injustice. As in No Country no one sees the entire pictureexcept perhaps the Almighty who is if He exists a crueler jokester than even the makers of Blood Simple and Burn After Reading. The vision is mordant and absurdistbut not nihilistic. The Coens open with a quote from Rashi Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you. The lesson of Larry Gopnik is how to lose gracefully. Its fascinating that the Coens whove been working their way through movie tropes since 1984 have used Cormac McCarthy as a springboard to their own childhood. A Serious Man is an artistic leap although its far from perfect. Some of their work is mannered like the kids over-orchestrated cussing the cartoon-shrew wife and the fleshy close-ups. (Jews are earthy and have ear hair we know.) But I love how the Coens bring out the unnatural perspectives of sixties suburbiathe hard canted lines of lawns and fences and ticky-tack houses. On the roof trying to adjust the antenna so his son can watch F Troop Larry watches his hostile Gentile deer-hunting neighbors on one side and a naked housewife smoking a joint on the other while the scrambled sounds of his era waft up from the TV. Initially the Coens conceived of the film as having two protagonists the father and the son (in 1967 Ethan and Joel were 10 and 13 respectively) but drifted toward Larry as they wrote. That might account for why the films most uproarious epiphanya Bar Mitzvah seen through the haze of marijuanais the boys and not his fathers. But the various perspectives gel. A Serious Man is not only hauntingly original its the final piece of the puzzle that is the Coens. Combine suburban alienation philosophical inquiry moral seriousness a mixture of respect for and utter indifference to Torah and finally a ton of dope and you get one of the most remarkable oeuvres in modern film. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Laced with good-natured hipster kitsch and endearingly goofy girl power director Drew Barrymores roller-derby dramedy ""Whip It"" is a gas. In her contact-sporting debut feature Barrymore hams it up as injury-prone skater ""Smashley Simpson"" but pays equal attention to all players in a lively femme-centered ensemble led by Ellen Page -- who as blooming wallflower Bliss Cavendar (aka ""Babe Ruthless"") finally has a role to match her star-making turn in ""Juno."" Young females will roll in the aisles and in general B.O. prospects look zippy for Fox Searchlights Oct. 2 release particularly as the fall track appears overcrowded with weightier opponents. Faithfully adapting her novel ""Derby Girl"" screenwriter Shauna Cross follows the basic rules of the coming-of-age movie as punk-spirited Texas teen Bliss (Page) yearns to distinguish herself from old-school Mom and Dad (Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern) who have her enrolled in cheesy ""Little Miss Sunshine""-style beauty pageants. When bespectacled Bliss a waitress in a small-town BBQ joint happens upon the rough-and-tumble world of womens roller derby the discovery liberates not only her but the movie which likewise finds its true calling on and around the track. Hiding her age in order to try out for the Hurl Scouts Bliss displays surprising speed even on her old Barbie skates and lands a coveted spot on the team despite an initial reluctance to push and shove competitors -- the sports raison detre particularly for hooting fans. Though Barrymore isnt much interested in mapping the spatial complexities of roller-derby action her shooting of the games -- equal parts silly and violent -- is plenty visceral for these purposes. What distinguishes ""Whip It"" from the sports-film pack is the directors keen focus on the minutiae of team camaraderie as Bliss learns to body-check opponents and is gradually accepted by her elder Hurl Scouts -- tough-as-nails chicks with self-styled Army-green getups and names like ""Maggie Mayhem"" (Kristen Wiig) and ""Bloody Holly"" (Zoe Bell ""Death Proof""). As coach of her own team Barrymore has assembled a game crew of alt-film all-stars including d.p. Robert Yeoman (""Rushmore"") editor Dylan Tichenor (""Magnolia"") and ubiquitous music supervisor Randall Poster whose soundtrack ranging from the Ramones to the Breeders matches the fast-rolling action hit for hit. Kevin Kavanaughs production design captures working-class Texas marvelously and Catherine Marie Thomas costumes -- particularly the skaters outfits from helmets to fishnets -- are a hoot. If ""Whip It"" seems to push its luck with a near-two-hour running time its a forgivable offense in the context of Barrymores palpable desire to make the relationships resolve not just happily but believably. Up to the climactic championship game (inconveniently held on the night of Moms beloved Bluebonnet pageant) the movies final third is a comprehensive series of lengthy two-handers between Bliss and various intimates her intimidating rival (a rad Juliette Lewis) her fave teammate/confidante (Wiig) her overprotective mom her cheerleading dad her jealous best friend (Alia Shawkat) and her cute but untrustworthy beau (Landon Pigg). Remarkably none of these dialogue-heavy scenes takes the easy way out. Of course sizable credit for the films winning ways belongs to Page whose performance -- complete with her own skating -- is one of grit grace and speed. Acting far less precocious than she did in ""Juno"" and ""Hard Candy"" the young thesp takes a slight and welcome turn toward realism here while hewing to the fancifully warm tone that is the movies defining quality. As if the emotional weight of a Hurl Scouts food fight werent surprising enough the end credits cliched use of comedic bloopers feels downright poignant as ""Whip It"" reluctantly takes leave of its lovably butt-kicking heroines -- at least until the sequel.
