"Movie Review Babylon A.D. - 1 star out of 5 - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie Review Babylon A.D. - 1 star out of 5 Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Heres what happened to Vin Diesel the subject of so many ""The action hero for the New Millennium"" cover stories back when Pitch Black The Fast and the Furious and xXx were hot. Vin never learned the Eastwood Rule.Back in the day nobody made more action films than Clint. And not all of them were masterpieces. But Eastwood legend has it would take his script and mark out big chunks of his dialogue. It wasnt just that he could act without words or that words were never his strong suit. He knew bad dialogue is a serious buzz kill for a guy carving out a piece of movie cool for himself. Diesel all muscles and ex-bouncer beefiness wants to talk. He let all the hype get to his big bald head and he figured he was a better actor than he is. He talked himself right out of A-pictures and straight into B-movies like Babylon A.D.Just how bad things have gotten is evident in Babylon a gritty sci-fi road picture in the Children of Men mold with Diesel playing a mercenary hired to escort a waif from a convent in Mongolia to a crowded advertising-riddled New York of the future. Diesel talks. A lot. He tries to do the cynical mercenary-style narration.""Save the planet? What for? And from what? Ourselves?"" Hes good at hard-boiled. Just in small doses.""Karl I thought you were in Sudan killin babies""Diesel isnt the whole problem with this ""road picture"" that gives up the road far too soon this futuristic dystopia that doesnt have enough of Beyond Thunderdomes wit enough of Blade Runners style or grit. No wonder director Mathieu Kassovitz O(Gothika) has all but disowned it.Michelle Yeoh is Rebeka a kung-fu nun who helps Toorop Diesels merc take the moody Aurora (Melanie Thierry) across borders in a post-nuclear/post global-warming world of refugees guns and Russian tanks rolling hither and yon. More should have been made of this arduous journey but the film shows signs of serious cutting that the director had nothing to do with. Toorop was hired by an apparently dubbed Gerard Depardieu playing Gorsky a mob boss. A religious cult led by the cynical Charlotte Rampling wants the girl. So do others stuntmen/hunters who bounce around in that popular ""parkour"" style of leaping tall buildings in many many bounds.The movie has a nice look -- gray rusted metal exposed to Siberian and Bering Strait snow. What it lacks is coherence and a compelling reason for us to take this often-abrupt journey with Aurora Toorop and Sister Rebeka. Thats a mess that Vin Diesel is never able to talk his way out of.

Hes publicly disowned the studio cut of his latest feature Babylon AD (based on the book by Maurice G Dantec) which must have hurt as it cost a bomb in digital effects and nitroglycerine and its stuffed with highbrow thespians only a European director could attract to a Vin Diesel vehicle. All are wasted -- Gerard Depardieu as a caricature Russian mobster; Michelle Yeoh as a nun who has brought up a miracle child in a remote Mongolian convent; and the ever sexually threatening Charlotte Rampling as the high priestess of a new religion which seems to have something to do with cosmetic surgery and virgin birth -- an interesting combo but not one that is probed to any depth.With his face like a squashed doughnut and physique like the tyres of a huge truck Diesel just doesnt inhabit the same planet as Rampling or even Kassovitz himself. Melanie Thierry in the lead role as the preternatural Aurora can spot a clone at 30 paces but appears to be one herself in the mould of a young Nastasia Kinski or Milla Jovovich. But the story is frankly ridiculous and so is the film. The plot ends up pivoting on a feminist separatist conspiracy to colonise every soul on the planet (and create new ones without men) which is very post Da Vinci Code -- but this gangsta-rap ghetto-is-cool Blade Runner meets Neo James Bond action sci-fi film feels and looks very 1990s. Brutal nihilistic futurism like this was out of date despite buzz words like global warming locations resembling Grozny (or South Ossetia) and holographic touch screens to die for long before Hollywood even got its mitts on it Facebook Twitter Delicious Reddit Digg what are these?

"Babylon A.D. | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; babylon-a-d ) Babylon A.D. (United States/France 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Babylon A.D. has the look and feel of a skeleton an unfinished outline that whooshes by so fast that it becomes incomprehensible as its storyline and characters are lost in a flurry of fast cuts and poorly choreographed action sequences. The film is frustrating because there are instances of genuine visual flair (such as the futuristic New York) and times when one senses there might be ideas worth exploring (the roles of corporate sponsorship and religion in the new order). Alas this is a case of a potentially epic tale being pruned and diced to the point where its underlying ideas are reduced to trite clichA(c)s. The lackluster acting and horrendous dialogue dont help. And it says a lot about Babylon A.D. that director/co-writer Mathieu Kassovitz has made some damning statements about the theatrical version of the production that indicate he is unwilling to endorse the final cut. Babylon A.D. takes place at some time in the future in an era when the social order has broken down and corporations rule the cities. Toorop (Vin Diesel) is a mercenary for hire whose services are purchased by a thug named Gorsky (GA(c)rard Depardieu). His job pick up a ""package"" from a convent in Eastern Europe smuggle it into the United States and deliver it to the high priestess (Charlotte Rampling) of a new religion. The package turns out to be a young woman Aurora (MA(c)lanie Thierry) who exhibits some strange powers. Accompanying her is her guardian Sister Rebeka (Michelle Yeoh) the only woman whom Aurora trusts. At first this is just a job for Toorop but as he gets to know Aurora and Rebeka it turns into a personal quest of redemption. Vin Diesel once rumored to be the ""next great action hero"" has apparently fallen upon hard times. Never the most expressive of actors Diesel sleepwalks his way through this part without seeming to care that he does more than look buff and snarl his silly lines without stumbling over them. Theres no intensity or emotion. His character is supposed to become infatuated with Aurora but youd never guess that by Diesels performance. Is there such a thing as ""negative chemistry?"" It doesnt help that his leading lady seems to have been chosen more for her looks than her ability. Maybe all of her energy is being channeled into speaking English without too thick of an accent. Even the normally reliable Michelle Yeoh cant elevate the level of acting and one of the few things more laughable than the dialogue in Babylon A.D. is GA(c)rard Depardieus make-up. The films frequent perfunctory action sequences seem designed more as a means to distract viewers from the lifeless plot than because theres a need for them. They are neither exciting nor entertaining and the frequent cutting makes it difficult to figure out whats going on or to care about whos winning or which snow speeder is getting blown up. A lot of what happens in the last fifteen minutes is confusing with a dead character suddenly coming back to life and a live one dying for no obvious reason (I guess - its not really clear). The ultimate revelation of whats at stake is so underwhelming that it doesnt even rise to the level of a disappointment. Then again it would be necessary to care about the proceedings in order for this to matter. Kassovitz is a competent director who has made some workmanlike films (although his previous effort and English-language debut Gothika left a little to be desired) so his condemnation of the movie carries some weight. Whether things would have been better had the studio not gotten out the shears and trimmed some 15 minutes is impossible to tell although its doubtful that restoring the lost footage would have transformed Diesels lackluster performance or made the central conceit less ludicrous. Maybe Kassovitzs vision will be restored on DVD. Until then all we have to judge is the theatrical cut and its not worth the celluloid its printed on. Babylon A.D.

Send Feedback. Share Tweet Even if it never finds an audience outside L.A. someone ought to write a book called When Dull Films Happen To Clever Production Designers. It would probably help console Babylon A.D. designers Paul Cross and Sonja Klaus. Their work helps the film realize a near-future living in the wake of a profound ecological and/or economic collapse. (Whats happened is never made clear but it was obviously unpleasant.) Most of the world lives in a sprawling Third World black market where a rabbit trapped in a city park qualifies as a feast. The privileged few inhabit desolate urban palaces where any piece of glass can and usually does serve as a television screen. Blade Runner and Children Of Men did it before and better but this world is made to look both lived-in and ickily plausible. In fact maybe Cross and Klaus should write that book. They wouldnt be the first involved in the film to badmouth it. French director Mathieu Kassovitz publicly disowned it before its release. (Perhaps he was hoping to engineer a retreat back to the small-scale world that allowed him to make the acclaimed La Haine and move away from a Hollywood stint thats seen Gothika and this film.) Kassovtiz certainly wont be the last to say unkind things about it. Babylon A.D. opens in a Russian wasteland thats home to Vin Diesel a soldier of fortune condemned as a terrorist and unable to return to his U.S. homeland. (For the benefit of our younger readers Diesel was a minor movie star in the early 00s.) When a Russian fat man (Gerard Depardieu) presses him into service Diesel is charged with transporting kung-fu action nun Michelle Yeoh and her mysterious young companion (the Mischa Barton-esque Melanie Thierry) to modern New York. That would count as a difficult task in the sucky middle of the 21st century even if the trio werent being pursued by gunmen. As long it sticks to that chase Babylon A.D. remains a sub-passable lead-footed action film with neat scenery. When it tries to explain why everyone wants Thierry in a badly patched together final act--something about artificial intelligence and a virgin birth--it gets into real trouble. Diesel for one doesnt do anything to rescue the film delivering some of the least-inspired line readings this side of an industrial film. Dialogue like ""This isnt a game"" doesnt help. And true it isnt a game. In games at least somebody wins.

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday August 29 2008 538 PM Is this really what its come to for Vin Diesel? Less than a decade ago he was touted as the Next Big Action Star. Now the best gig he can get is ""Babylon A.D."" an abysmal French thriller in which everyone - Diesel included - speaks as if theyve learned their lines phonetically.Directed by once-promising filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz and based on the sci-fi novel ""Babylon Babies"" the movie opens into a futuristic society in which Diesels Toorop works as a mercenary. When a crass gangster (Gerard Depardieu) asks him to escort a young woman from a Mongolian convent to Times Square he grabs the money and the gig. But its not going to be as easy as he expects.Although she looks entirely human Aurora (Melanie Thierry) is the scientifically created pawn of a priestess (Charlotte Rampling) who sees the girl as a marketing tool. A new millennium Virgin Mother Aurora is pregnant with twins despite having spent her entire life in the convent with only Sister Rebeka (Michelle Yeoh) for company. Its Toorops job to get Aurora safely to New York so the priestess can unveil this miracle to the world. But because Aurora also holds a potentially deadly virus within her body other factions are determined to kidnap her before she arrives in America.Or something. The plot makes absolutely no sense which would be almost forgivable if Kassovitz gave us something else to hang onto. But the direction is sloppy the editing choppy and the action so haphazard you wonder why anyone bothered.Thats particularly true for respected actors like Rampling Depardieu and Yeoh all of whom should be hiding at home in shame until the movie leaves theaters. Since hes in desperate need of a comeback vehicle Diesel has more at stake - making it especially odd that he delivers every line as though he was recovering from a severe blow to the head. Which come to think of it is how youll probably feel when the whole experience is over too.

"Diesel gets lost in Babylon - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Diesel gets lost in Babylon By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent / August 30 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + French filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz might be familiar from his gritty career-making Parisian ghetto drama ""La Haine"" or from acting gigs in ""Amelie"" and ""Munich."" Its the sort of artily populist resume that would reasonably give you hope for his new sci-fi foray ""Babylon A.D."" - not as 2008s answer to ""Alphaville"" maybe but at least as an action import on a par with Luc Besson. If only. When this Vin Diesel vehicle isnt pointlessly frenzied its narratively inert wasting some decent production design and a French-flavored cast primed for fun. Kassovitz also must have missed the Zagat entry about how Diesel is best ordered in light portions and definitely on the side. (See ""Pitch Black."")Diesel plays Toorop a glowering sometime-mercenary lying low in war-demolished near-future Eastern Europe living just to unwind at night with a glass of red wine and a plate of varmint sautee. Unsurprisingly hes pulled back into the game forcibly by his old gangster boss Gorsky (Gerard Depardieu amusingly done up in a ""Sopranos"" track suit and pepperoni-toned foundation). The assignment Escort young seemingly clairvoyant Aurora (Melanie Thierry very obviously cast in the Milla Jovovich mold) from a convent in the Mongolian hinterlands to a mysterious medical consult in New York. Sister Rebeka (Michelle Yeoh) tags along to keep things on track but the three are soon stumbling into every crazed mob scene and underground cage-match venue this side of Kazakhstan.Youll be able to spot the bits that undoubtedly went over big in pitch meetings for ""Babylon"" which reportedly had its share of production problems. Group parkour acrobatics at one point are spliced with some of Yeohs signature martial artistry. An Arctic pursuit sequence involving snowmobiles and flying fighter drones has one X Games-worthy stunt (or visual effect?) and does a passable job of aping Bond. But these moments are completely fleeting and immediately followed by more of the same old storytelling grind.Could Aurora be a viral bomb? Why are a new-religion heavy (Charlotte Rampling) and a mechanically tricked-out scientist (Lambert Wilson ""Flawless"") surveilling her? Why does most of the world look like a refugee camp? Are we supposed to take Diesels kicker workboots and hoodie for an iconic sci-fi look? By the time Kassovitz gets around to answering these questions if ever its impossible to care much. For an action road trip the movie leads to highway hypnosis. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company. Babylon A.D.

"Babylon A.D. (2008) The Globe and Mail Review Babylon is a mess of biblical proportions By Jason Anderson Monday September 1 2008 Genre action adventure Babylon A.D.Directed by Mathieu KassovitzStarring Vin Diesel Michelle Yeoh Melanie ThierryClassification 14A Released at the end of the summer with little marketing and no screenings for reviewers Babylon A.D. has every appearance of being a rote action flick that will go unnoticed by anyone but the most devoted fans of Vin Diesel. And so it is... pretty much. With its incoherent narrative exposition-heavy dialogue and uncharismatic hero - there are blocks of concrete with more range as actors than Vin Diesel - its instantly forgettable. Even so the fact that its not a Hollywood genre film but a European simulation of one yields a few intriguing wrinkles. In fact Babylon A.D. was the subject of considerable speculation on Internet movie sites since the project was announced. Co-writer and director Mathieu Kassovitz has a distinguished CV as a filmmaker (his 1995 drama La Haine was a prescient portrait of class and racial tensions in Pariss most volatile banlieues) and actor (he played the object of Audrey Tautous affections in Amelie). His source material here was Babylon Babies a well-regarded French cyberpunk novel by Maurice G. Dantec. Besides casting Diesel and Hong Kong action icon Michelle Yeoh he has populated Babylon A.D. with the classier likes of Gerard Depardieu Charlotte Rampling and Lambert Wilson. There was every indication Kassovitz would deliver something more than the average post-Matrix shoot-em-up. Yet whether its due to his own shortcomings or to demands that he deliver a much leaner version for North American release (its 10 minutes shorter than the European cut) the resulting film is a mess. Indeed the director has been busy trashing Babylon A.D. himself claiming that studio interference and ""bad producers"" prevented him from doing even a single scene as hed intended. Set in the Earth of 2019 - which is very much like the war-plagued ecologically ravaged place audiences last saw in the far superior Children of Men - Babylon A.D. is the story of Toorop (Diesel) a mercenary hired to smuggle some human cargo from a Mongolian convent to New York. Its instantly obvious that the waifish Aurora (Melanie Thierry) has a crucial role to play in those world-changing events that are always imminent in a story like this. Toorop and Auroras long-time guardian Sister Rebekah (Yeoh) work hard to protect her from the many threats they encounter on the long road to the Big Apple. In terms of visual design Babylon A.D. is not without some pop. The setting of many early scenes calls to mind what Blade Runner mightve looked like if relocated to Eastern Europe - hordes of people fight for survival in compounds that combine the worst traits of refugee camps and open-air markets and who are surrounded by video billboards and giant ads for Coke and Marlboro. As for the future New York the place is lit up like an oversized Japanese pachinko parlour. The action choreography is also spiced up by some of the French free-running stunts that were so exhilarating in Casino Royales building-site chase scene. Alas the storyline is a sinkhole that swallows up any sense and suspense. Diesels inability to flex his facial muscles is another problem that Kassovitz cannot overcome. ""Im very unhappy with the film"" the director recently told an online magazine. Join the club. Copyright (c) 2003 Bell Globemedia Interactive Inc.

Flash-forward to the equally desperate Another Gay Sequel Gays Gone Wild which begins with a nightmare that doesnt let up even after Nico (Jonah Blechman) wakes up. Virgins no more the motley crew of fags (all played by different actors except for Blechmans nelly queen) travel to Fort Lauderdale -- think Fire Island as reimagined by Rainbow Brite -- for a fucktastic spring break that ends with trite lessons learned about monogamy ostracism and the sparring ways of the heart and hole. Having blown his satirical load on the first film Stephens settles for grand-scale minstrelsy this time around giving scant screen time to Lady Bunny and Whitney Houston -- er RuPaul -- and way too much to Amanda Lepores tits and our communitys own Stepin Fetchit Perez Hilton. Bigger longer and uncut -- but only in the phallic sense -- this mincing bad time is built entirely around shrill pop-culture references. But how queer am I that I knew its only funny line was taken wholesale from the great Romy and Micheles High School Reunion? (Sunset 5) (Ed Gonzalez) GO BEAUTIFUL LOSERS The ongoing trouble with docs about artists is that too few are very artfully made themselves or else they fail to demonstrate any insight into their subjects impulses/goals/creative processes. Displaying artwork onscreen and interpreting it via talking-head sound bites has become the new dancing-about-architecture. Alleged gallery curator turned filmmaker Aaron Roses celebratory portrait of the early-90s L.E.S. fringe artists who took part in his traveling exhibition -- success stories like propaganda parodist Shepard Fairey Thumbsucker director and visual artist Mike Mills and skateboarding prodigy turned photographer and painter Ed Templeton -- makes all the aforementioned missteps. ""Look how cool my dispossessed friends are"" the filmmaker seems to boast when fellow DIY-er Harmony Korine amusingly tells playground kids that his friends decapitated head was found where theyre playing. Rose superficially confronts the tenuously connected (or in this case thinly spread) group on the mainstreams co-opting of their outsider sensibilities and the personal expressions that define their work. He like the artists seems uninterested in reflecting on society or culture writ large. Yet regardless of Roses intentions his underachieving airiness is both entertaining and perfectly fitting for the slacker ennui of his cliques rising years -- when comic books were for nerds skateboarding and graffiti for rebels and none of these cats couldve predicted the Pepsi and Marc Jacobs campaigns coming their way. (Nuart) (Aaron Hillis) BABYLON A.D. Hardly the utter fiasco promised by its lengthy delay and no-press dumping on Labor Day weekend Mathieu Kassovitzs Babylon A.D. arrives shorn of 10 minutes of its European running time and God knows what else cut before the film ever made it into any theater. In a vague post-apocalyptic future mercenary Toorop (Vin Diesel) hides out in Russia until mobster Gorsky (Gerard Depardieu) hires him to smuggle Aurora (Melanie Thierry) into the U.S. Unsurprisingly two factions led by cult actors -- Lambert Wilson as Auroras father on one side and the ever-freaky Charlotte Rampling as mom a.k.a. High Priestess the CEO of the Neolite sect on the other -- attempt to kill them along every step of their journey. Whats missing here are the seeds that would explain what Kassovitz increasingly seems to be angling for in the back half a dystopian vision of a society in which organized religion is the exclusive pretext for global corporate dominance. Without whatever strident critique Kassovitz intends its a typical B action movie -- the inevitable pseudo-warm bonding scenes deadly the fights largely incoherent -- with the occasional pleasing set-piece. If nothing else its nice to see an action movie that takes Europe not America as its grounding point. And depicting Russia as the worlds future dominant power suddenly seems oddly prescient.

Sep. 13 600pm COLLEGE Film critics never come home stinking of their honest labor but the nearest equivalent is reviewing something like College which leaves its stain on ones very humanity. Three high-school bros on a college visit -- a dork a gelatinous loudmouth and a faintly sympathetic straight man with anime-character hair -- run afoul of a frat marshaled by a smug Van Wilder/that-Sugar-Ray-guy amalgam who subjects the boys to Sadean hazing. (He also has the one funny line ""What the fuck do you know about welfare reform?"") And so begins a morally numbing gantlet run through mechanical decadence surpassing even the straight-to-DVD soul-gangbanging American Pie Presents The Naked Mile. ""Queef"" ""tossed salad"" Verne Troyer and the ol fist-pump open-mouth tongue-in-cheek blowjob pantomime are utilized just as though they were jokes (what kids -- no ""donkey punch""?). The overall mood is limply obligatory as if everyone involved had been court-ordered to make a raunchfest party flick (director Deb Hagen only tunes in during her one tracking shot). One cant imagine theres an actual screenplay behind this -- somebody seems to think Fatty is so good you can just let him riff. Nearly justifies traveling back in time to pre-emptively kill Edison Muybridge and the Lumiere brothers. (Selected theaters) (Nick Pinkerton)  GO  DEATH NOTE Feeling disenfranchised by the Japanese legal systems failure to prosecute heinous criminals ambitious law student Light (Tatsuya Fujiwara) starts enforcing his own brand of justice after he stumbles upon the Death Note the ledger of a grim-reaper figure called Ryuk. The books power is simple Whoevers name you write in its pages dies. But when baddies start expiring from heart attacks with alarming frequency the police including Lights father (Takeshi Kaga) launch a manhunt with the help of a mysterious super-detective known only as L (Kenichi Matsuyama). Adapted from Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obatas manga director Shusuke Kanekos grungy thriller wastes time waxing philosophical about criminals rights before quickly deducing that no one in the theater cares about such thematic undercurrents. From there Death Note is all twisty cat-and-mouse chess match as L tries to uncover Lights identity while Light alters his murder patterns and offs innocents to elude capture. Betraying its comic-book origins Death Note doesnt have characters so much as pungent types and the dialogue fluctuates between pithy nihilism and juvenile stabs at hip but the combatants mano-a-mano gamesmanship has such pulpy inventiveness that your inner fan-boy will most assuredly rejoice. See it now or wait until the inevitably horrible American remake. (ImaginAsian Center) (Tim Grierson) DISASTER MOVIE In the Adam Sandler vehicle Little Nicky Hitler spends eternity in Hell in a frilly smock getting pineapples shoved up his butt. Compared to anyone watching Disaster Movie he got off light. Rushed into production with no better drape for its threadbare gags than Cloverfield -- unless you count such proud upholders of the Irwin Allen tradition as Juno Enchanted and High School Musical -- this carpet-fouling mongrel of a movie no more deserves release than do anthrax spores. Visually an eyesore comically a much-lower-seated pain its the same as writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzers other (fill in the blank) movie parodies only somehow uglier and lazier. Ugliness and laziness can sometimes work to comedys advantage but not here -- not when the level of inspiration is someone answering a Get Smart shoe phone only to smear his face with dog crap. Yes there are nods to Hannah Montana and ""Im Fucking Matt Damon""; yes Crista Flanagan does a spot-on Ellen Page -- and yes you can feel the dead air in the theater as joke after so-called joke falls splat on the pavement. The bastards couldnt even find the energy to put an exclamation point after the title. Best text message sent from my screening (it wasnt me but I certainly sympathized) ""I want to die."" (Citywide) (Jim Ridley) GO I SERVED THE KING OF ENGLAND Septuagenarian Czech filmmaker Jiri Menzels latest boasts the same darkly sarcastic and lyrically absurdist trademarks that fellow Czech New Wavers Milos Forman and Vera Chytilova were known for in the 60s. But I Served the King of England is hardly past its prime and perhaps even timeless. After years in a Czech prison grizzled everyman Jan (Oldrich Kaiser) is exiled to an abandoned German border town where he reflects on the charmed naivete of his youth. Flash back to the 30s when Jan is a young towheaded pip-squeak -- now played by a sublimely likable Ivan Barnev -- whose fascination with the wealthy sparks pipe dreams of becoming a millionaire. From humble beginnings selling hot dogs and working as hotelier Jan rises through the ranks over the decade -- a climb that parallels his innocent sexual awakening. Then he falls for a Hitler-supporting madchen (Julia Jentsch) and thus begins his unwitting collaboration with the monsters who overran his country. Though the film may be visually fanciful -- as money rains down from the sky a glowing halo of light shines behind a characters noggin -- any preconceived notion that this is yet another historical epic with some magic realism thrown in must be quashed. Menzels whimsy is the means not the end; do away with the clever style and youre still left with a rousing picaresque of lifes beautiful-sad ironies. (Royal; Playhouse 7; Town Center 5) (Aaron Hillis)RED If Death Wish had begun with armed thugs killing Charles Bronsons dog instead of his wife and Bronson had spent the rest of the movie merely trying to obtain an apology it might have looked something like this refreshingly low-key mostly gore-free horror outing based on a novel by cult author Jack Ketchum and credited to two directors (Norwegian filmmaker Trygve Allister Diesen took over the reins from May auteur Lucky McKee after production problems temporarily closed down the shoot). In a broadly entertaining (if faintly hammy) performance the barrel-chested Scotsman Brian Cox stars as Avery Ludlow a courtly country gentleman who just wants to sit by the river and fish in peace -- until a trio of nogoodnik rich kids decide it would be fun to rob him at gunpoint and give his mangy old hound a shotgun blast to the head. As Ludlow seeks that perpetual enigma -- ""justice"" -- Red traipses over some suitably ambiguous sociological ground concerning wealth privilege and personal morality without ever delving too deeply beneath the surface The movies escalating series of tit-for-tat revenge ploys becomes a bit tedious even at 95 minutes but Cox and a rich (if not always well-served) supporting cast that includes Tom Sizemore Amanda Plummer and Robert Englund keep it more than watchable throughout.

"A Babylon (A.D.) revisited - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW A Babylon (A.D.) revisitedThe sci-fi adventure offers the usual violence with a too-confusing plot.September 01 2008|Michael Ordona | Special to The Times The gritty world-weariness that informs the first 10 minutes of the new sci-fi adventure ""Babylon A.D."" promises something along the lines of the daring socially inquisitive ""Children of Men"" with the bonus of Vin Diesel killing people. Unfortunately the film quickly degenerates into chases and gunfights and not much else.This is not a terrible movie but its too familiar by half and too confusing by a third. Director Mathieu Kassovitz best known stateside as Audrey Tautous love interest in ""Amelie"" but also respected in Europe as a filmmaker (""La Haine"") does have a vision beyond the usual genre schlock. He presents a casually hopeless future in the movies opening segment in a rugged desperate Russia the ugly other side of Ridley Scotts ""Blade Runner.""The film however soon settles into a worn-out tale of a sullen bruiser (Diesel) reluctantly escorting a mysterious angelic young person (Melanie Thierry) to a far-off destination -- the promised land of New York.Along for the ride is the girls loyal guardian a nun in an emerging religion who happens to be a martial arts expert (the always-intriguing Michelle Yeoh). Bad guys betrayals a hint of parkour -- yawn.""Babylon"" feels like an almost random pastiche of good and bad. There may be a deadly virus or genetic engineering or a virgin birth or some combination of all its not clear.There definitely are confounding set-piece fights in which people dont take cover as bullets fly and the sudden disappearance of the futuristic vision expressed early on.The ending is abrupt. It follows a confusing final 20 minutes that imply a higher striving that may have been present in the source novel (""Babylon Babies"") but on screen there is merely that improbable gun battle and further echoes of ""Blade Runner.""The film is in English but one suspects something was lost in translation anyway The French cut is reportedly about 10 minutes longer than the American edits 91.Kassovitz and the studio are apparently feuding over the finished product. There may be an interesting directors cut DVD down the line but this theatrical version is less than riveting.--""Babylon A.D."" MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action language and some sexuality. Running time 1 hour 31 minutes. In general release.

Hired by sleazy Russian gangster Gorsky (Gerard Depardieu) to deliver beautiful child prodigy Aurora to New York cynical mercenary Toorop (Diesel) braves foul weather corrupt people-traffickers base-jumping villains and drone attack planes. Along for the ride is kick-ass nun Sister Rebecca (Michelle Yeoh) who keeps quiet about the custody battle involving Auroras birth parents. Her scientist father (Lambert Wilson) genetically manipulated his own unborn daughter to create the first superhuman; her mother (Charlotte Rampling) now the head of a New Age religious cult plans to present the girl as the new Messiah. Unfortunately a Matrix-style shoot-out offers a glib violent solution to what is otherwise an intriguing emotional conflict.

Looking less like hes trying to save the planet than like hes fighting off a really bad hangover Vin Diesel punches shoots but ultimately dozes his way through the sloppy sci-fi actioner ""Babylon A.D."" A noisier costlier version of ""Children of Men"" yet lacking that films social-political significance and jaw-dropping direction scribe-helmer Mathieu Kassovitzs heftiest production to date may also be his least successful effort to breach Hollywoods walls as a high-budget filmmaker. Released in France before it opens Aug. 29 Stateside in a version trimmed by about 10 minutes ""Babylon"" will require plenty of prayers to reach B.O. paradise. Adapted from French writer Maurice G. Dantecs 700-plus-page ""Babylon Babies"" pic strips the book of its weightier material -- which includes an analysis of post-Soviet conflict strategy and a philosophical take on cybernetic bio-engineering -- and leaves only the threadbare plot. After a (literally) eye-catching sequence that shows early signs of the CGI action to come pic flashes back a week earlier to war-rattled ""New Serbia"" where gun-for-hire Toorop (Diesel) sits out the fighting in a boarded-up apartment. Dressed like a frat boy heading for an early morning class and showing just as much conviction he barely reacts when a SWAT team busts in to bring him to Gorsky (Gerard Depardieu sporting an unnecessary prosthetic nose) a Russian mafioso offering a sizeable payoff if Toorop delivers a special package to New York. The package in question is a mysterious blonde nymph Aurora (Melanie Thierry) whos been hidden away in a convent under the protection of Sister Rebecca (Michelle Yeoh). Instead of inquiring why Aurora is worth the hefty price of border smuggling Toorop shrugs off any serious questioning unsuccessfully tries to light a cigarette (a gag repeated throughout) and the three set off. First destination is a train station in Kazakhstan which occasions one of the pics more convincing set pieces when a bomb detonates. A second stop at a Vladivostok nightclub (whose featured entertainment is Ultimate Fighting Championship-style death matches) introduces Toorops war buddy Finn (Mark Strong) to the team and the four barely escape a run-in with some jumpy henchman. Lengthy middle action sequence has them crossing the Bering Strait on snowmobiles (actually shot in Sweden) and here Kassovitz revisits the kinds of snow-filled scenes that marked his French suspenser ""The Crimson Rivers."" Yet as with most of this pics fighting and effects the reliance on extreme closeups frenzied handheld camerawork and rapid editing leaves little room to enjoy the breathtaking views let alone fully grasp Toorops heroic abilities. When they finally reach New York -- which in this futuristic version has a few more skyscrapers and a lot more electronic billboards -- they prepare to hand Aurora over to the pale Neolite Priestess (Charlotte Rampling convincing but short-lived) who heads up the powerful sect/corporation that commanded the transaction. But as previewed by the pics initial flash-forward the exchange does not go according to plan. Comparisons to ""The Fifth Element"" -- another French-produced and -helmed blockbuster featuring a bankable Hollywood actor -- are likely and both films suffer from the same lightweight characterization and misfired attempts to render a future society both credible and meaningful. Whereas Kassovitzs earlier features from his breakout ""La Haine"" to his last U.S. effort ""Gothika"" revealed a strong sense of style and directorial wit such qualities seem absent from ""Babylon A.D."" which takes itself far too seriously yet fails to deliver its muddled message. Fans of ""Pitch Black"" hoping Diesel would reprise the stone-faced Richard Riddick role here will be disappointed and he seems to be half-smirking through much of the films risible dialogue (co-written by Gallic scriber Eric Besnard). Yeoh and promising young thesp Thierry manage to extract a few bits of emotion mostly when theyre not talking. While the novel is set in 2013 the film does not specify its time period although the production design by Sonja Klaus and Paul Cross feels ""near-future."" Darkish lensing by longtime Luc Besson collaborator Thierry Arbogast befits the films somber tone but doesnt make the action which includes stunts by parkour founder David Belle easy to follow. For all its continent-hopping pic was largely shot at Pragues Barrandov Studio. Print viewed in Paris ran 100 minutes while U.S. version purportedly runs 90 minutes.
