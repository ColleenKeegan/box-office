Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Forget April. January is the cruelest month for moviegoers. Nobody in the picture business is bringing forth lilies to enliven the poets ""dead land."" While everyones attention is fixed on the Oscar nominations its the moment for cheesy slasher epics and the reluctant release of last years failed genre effort movies that may mix ""memory and desire"" but only in the most unappetizing ways. OK Ill drop the T.S. Eliot references. But only if you promise not to waste your time and money on -- oh lets say Smokin Aces. Its possible that in some half-forgotten pitch meeting someone murmured the phrase ""black comedy"" in describing their intentions for the movie. It is also possible that names like Scorsese or Tarantino or the Coen brothers were bandied about in that conclave. But what they meant to say was ""blood bath."" The situation is that a mob hit has been ordered on a drug-addled Las Vegas magician/informer. Competing hit teams -- bounty hunters neo-Nazis a pair of deadly lesbian ladies -- turn up to compete for the million dollars on offer for completing the job. The FBI of course is attempting to protect the man they hope is going to be their star witness. Pretty soon everyone get to killing everyone else. You have quite possibly never seen so much unedifying mayhem in a relatively confined space the smallest of which is a hotel elevator in which two guys pump uncounted bullets into one another at point blank range. Hmm one muses -- never seen that before. But thats the full extent of writer-director Joe Carnahans originality. And since he never bothers to establish why we should care about any of his characters we just sit there numbly awaiting the next sensation and trying without notable success to comprehend the preposterous backstory -- dating back decades -- with which it is lackadaisically equipped. Seraphim Falls has one of those too. There must be some reason why in the winter snows of the Wests high country a band of marauders led by Carver (Liam Neeson) is expending such implacable efforts to wipe out Gideon (Pierce Brosnan). By the time the chase has descended to the deserts burning sands we learn that the latter was a once-peaceful farmer whose family was wiped out by Civil War irregulars led by Neeson (shades of the much better outlaw Josie Wales). Gideon will have his vengeance if possible Carver will defend himself by relentlessly attacking him. But the lone victim is a clever cuss and succeeds in wiping out all of his pursuers save Carver. The fleeing and fighting is intermittently interesting but one is more interested frankly in why Anjelica Huston suddenly intrudes on the film selling patent medicine and vague spirituality. Also in why the near-moribund western genre suddenly reappears in this rather austere if handsomely mounted form. It is the kind of movie that gets you thinking not so much about its ostensible subject but about how difficult it must have been for director and co-writer David Von Ancken to make -- toting all that production gear up into the waist-deep snows plunging Brosnan (or his stunt double) into the eponymous falls while wearing a fur coat that must weigh 20 pounds even before it becomes soaking wet. It is not a terrible movie -- its beginning holds a certain promise -- just finally an unengaging one. Which grants it a certain kinship with Catch and Release a romantic non-comedy -- its really more in the mode of an old-fashioned ""womens picture"" -- in which a woman named Gray Wheeler (Jennifer Garner) finds her wedding day turning into a funeral for her fiance suddenly lost in an accident. For reasons best known to her she continues to hang around his bachelor bungalow in Boulder Colorado mourning his passing with two former roommate (Kevin Smith and Sam Jaeger) and a visiting pal named Fritz (Timothy Olyphant) who turns out to be much nicer than he first appears to be. They learn that the fiance was perhaps a tad less ideal than Gray thought him to be -- a massage therapist from Los Angeles (Juliette Lewis) arrives with a son all are convinced was fathered by Grays lost love. You can make a comedy on almost any subject -- as Preston Sturges (and even Mel Brooks) have proved. But theres no spark in this one. And no sparkle in Garners playing. Shes an attractive young woman but her energy is low and her mood is endlessly wistful. Olyphant seems more of a male model than an actor and the writer-director Susannah Grant does not know how to stir her actors up comedically or romantically. Its an odd thing. Back when men directed womens pictures they throbbed with energy perhaps because female behavior was such an enigma to them perhaps because actresses like Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were so headlong so committed to the emotional extremes. You might not in the end believe them but boy they were gripping to watch. Directors like Grant or Nancy Meyers (of The Holiday among other titles) want to keep their leading ladies unhysteric as if descents into the irrational were somehow fuel for sexism. But the politely furrowed brow is fundamentally anti-dramatic. You want people in films like this to rip and snort their way to improbable but somehow satisfying resolutions. Unless of course youre content to have your convictionless genre picture dumped into January release. Meantime the viewers eye wanders toward the calendar -- only five more days till February only another month until the Oscar hype disappears overnight. Only a couple of months until we begin faintly to hear the first drumbeats for the big spring and summer releases. Theyll mostly be pretty awful too. But at least someone will believe in them. Or pretend to.

That heart beating in the chest of a sleazy magician named Buddy ""Aces"" Israel figures heavily in an otherwise heartless and ultimately brainless action thriller. But calling Joe Carnahans movie heartless implies that this auteur of affectless anarchy might have meant to invest it with detectable human feelings and failed. Better to call it heart-free and acknowledge the wisdom of Mr. Carnahans self-promoting semiliterate Web site in which he says ""Dont let those douchebag critics scare you off. I promise on the souls of my ancestors you will come out of that movie with at least one scene that youll never forget."" ENLARGE Possibly more than one. The splatter of mutual snuffery in an elevator. The grisly ventriloquism of a killer manipulating his dead victims face. A monstrous child gone off his Ritalin. The souls of the filmmakers ancestors may be safer than our own for ""Smokin Aces"" is a vision nightmarish but far from unthinkable of a movie genre in which drama and character -- fuhgetabout character development -- have been banished by extravagant freakery cheerful degeneracy mind-numbing logorrhea lip-jerk profanity and serial spasms of murderous violence all framed in the sort of striking hollow images pioneered by fashion photography and music videos. Mr. Carnahan came to prominence four years ago with a darkly efficient little cop thriller called ""Narc."" To give him his due on ""Smokin Aces"" (the first word of the title is a gerund) he applies lavish amounts of manic energy and perverse humor to an outwardly simple premise -- all sorts of unpleasant people want to kill Buddy Israel before the FBI whisks him away to protective custody. The plot comes equipped with some intricate twists but they arent really dramatized. Rather theyre discussed and simultaneously illustrated in fragmentary music-video style -- first to let us know what were going to see and at the finish to explain what weve seen. This technique could suggest another failure if Joe Carnahan were actually interested in being a dramatist but the evidence of our eyes and besieged ears says otherwise. Hes a piler-onner. Just as his Web site contends he creates discrete -- though hardly discreet -- scenes for maximum impact then piles them on to build a movie. His borrowings start most obviously with Quentin Tarantino and then a string of black British gangster comedy-dramas but without the Brits sharp wit and polished performances. Not that his performers couldnt deliver wit or polish if asked to the cast includes Ray Liotta Alicia Keys Peter Berg Ben Affleck Jeremy Piven Andy Garcia the rapper Common and Ryan Reynolds. Only Mr. Reynolds as an FBI agent named Messner gets to play a character with an extra dimension. It isnt heart but Messner does bring a rationalists sensibility to the hopeless task of comprehending the chaos that surrounds him. Seraphim Falls ENLARGE From left Liam Neeson Robert Baker and Ed Lauter as men who go out in search of a fugitive in Seraphim Falls. For a substantial chunk of its running time ""Seraphim Falls"" is a model albeit a bloody one of what filmmakers can do with modest resources. The setting is classic Western spectacular -- heavy snows in high-altitude mountain forests. (The excellent cinematographer John Toll shot this part of the story near Taos New Mexico at elevations of 13000 to 14000 feet.) And the plot is classic revenge drama stripped to its essentials Gideon a desperate fugitive played impressively by Pierce Brosnan is being pursued by the pitiless Carver (Liam Neeson stone-faced) plus an ad hoc posse of Carvers hired hands. Before long though things take a turn from simplicity to sententiousness then to surreal silliness and finally to a mano-a-mano contest on a parched desert floor over which man gets the best close-ups. The film is a debut feature by David Von Ancken who directed from a script that he wrote with Abby Everett Jaques. (Mr. Von Anckens first claim to fame was ""Bullet in the Brain"" a poetic eerily elegiac short that streamed as original content on a video Web site.) The central narrative device of this film is a clever one -- more than clever its an interesting investigation of moral ambiguity -- but not enough to sustain a whole story. At the same time theres a too-muchness of brutality though Ive never seen pain and suffering portrayed more convincingly than when Gideon uses a Bowie knife to remove a bullet from his arm and cauterize the wound. Youre almost grateful for the silliness when Anjelica Huston shows up as a snake-oil peddler whose nostrum according to the sign on the side of her wagon ""cleanses the blood"" and ""exonerates the bowels."" Catch and Release Susannah Grant who wrote ""Erin Brockovitch"" has directed as well as written her first feature ""Catch and Release."" This romantic comedy stars Jennifer Garner as Gray Wheeler a woman struggling to recover from the sudden death of Grady her fiance. The setting is a Rocky Mountain high (Boulder and its environs) and the title refers both to fly-fishing one of Gradys passions and to Grays predicament -- how to free herself from her love which must remain unrequited for a man about whom Gray discovers she knew little. But the drama is cluttered with not-so-comic housemates played blandly by Kevin Smith and Sam Jaeger and the film suffers from a style that settles for pleasant or touching at the cost of spontaneous or impassioned. Too bad because Ms. Garner is a genuinely pleasing presence. So is Timothy Olyphant as Fritz an interesting option whos there for the taking. Juliette Lewis plays a New Age floozy and the film contains a running commercial for Celestial Seasonings teas.    DVD TIP Guy Ritchie turned ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) into a violent roundelay that throbs with scary energy startling characters (almost all male) and marvelous scabrous language. The marginally fathomable plot involves an epic crooked card game a hunt for cannabis and large amounts of cash that keep changing hands. The movie isnt nice but it certainly is nasty fun.

"Catch and Release Belly up | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCatch and Release Belly upA cheeky poll on the Internet Movie Database this week asked people how they feel about filmmaker Kevin Smith taking his first major acting role in Catch and Release  the hookless new romantic comedy.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 26 2007  (out of 4)Starring Jennifer Garner Kevin Smith Timothy Olyphant and Juliette Lewis. Written and directed by Susannah Grant. 124 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Article Continued BelowA cheeky poll on the Internet Movie Database this week asked people how they feel about filmmaker Kevin Smith taking his first major acting role in Catch and Release the hookless new romantic comedy.The majority answer ""not the least bit interested"" ranked just ahead of ""mildly curious."" Left far behind was a tiny minority of Smithphiles who proclaimed themselves ""thrilled to the core of my being."" (Even Kev himself would have trouble figuring out those people.)The general lack of enthusiasm is understandable for a movie delayed from release for nearly a year that has now been dumped into the cinema dead zone of January. But its misguided in the case of Smith who is just about the only person with a pulse in Catch and Release. Indeed were it not for Smiths mildly amusing antics it might have been necessary to attach a warning to the movie about the dangers of watching it whilst operating heavy machinery.Set in Boulder Colo. the only original thing about it Catch and Release is the directing debut of screenwriter Susannah Grant (Erin Brockovich) who also wrote it.Shes tempting fate with the title which just begs for a smarty-pants headline and also by naming her female protagonist Gray.Gray Wheeler (Jennifer Garner) is duller than a bowl of bran. She would likely be this way even if she werent mourning the sudden accidental death of her fiance Grady (who isnt seen) just as they are about to be married.Gradys demise leaves Gray not only with an organic wedding cake that will never be consumed but with a rented apartment she can no longer afford. She moves in with two of Gradys best friends wisecracking foodaholic Sam (Smith) and the creepily solicitous Dennis (Sam Jaeger). Dennis wants to build a ""Peace Garden"" in Gradys memory. This unlikely living arrangement is made all the more so by the arrival of yet another of Gradys pals the skirt-chasing Fritz (Timothy Olyphant) who has unnaturally white teeth and who promptly seduces the wedding caterer right before Grays horrified eyes. Gray takes an instant dislike to Fritz wondering how her devoted fiance could possibly have liked him. You know what this means. The inevitable cooing and billing ensues complicated by two shocking disclosures. Grady was better off than hed let on to Gray - did these two ever have a serious talk before getting engaged? - and he left behind some unfinished business involving a California massage therapist named Maureen (Juliette Lewis in screwball mode) and a rambunctious son with a suspicious family resemblance (Joshua Friesen). Could it be that Grady was a lot like Fritz and maybe Fritz isnt so much like that after all? Duh.None of these disclosures matter much or amount to much. The only one working up a head of steam in this movie is Smith which may explain why Grant has given him way more screen time than bit players normally get in rom-coms.A firmer directorial hand and more judicious editing would have prevented him from nearly wearing out his welcome and his habit of adding ""Sir"" to the end of his sentences starts to grate very early. As does the hippie rock soundtrack incidentally.Were still left with the feeling that this is the type of movie Smith would have been savagely mocking a decade ago when he was on top of his game.

Photo DOUG CURRAN About that dead fiance of yours ... 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Catch and Release Romantic comedy. Starring Jennifer Garner Timothy Olyphant Kevin Smith and Juliette Lewis. Directed by Susannah Grant. (PG-13. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its possible that there was simply no money in the budget for hair and makeup on the set of ""Catch and Release"" a new low-maintenance romantic comedy from the writer of ""Erin Brockovich."" Jennifer Garner goes through much of the movie with bags under her eyes Juliette Lewis looks like shes auditioning for a Dana Plato biopic and two major characters sport Rob Lowes haircut from ""St. Elmos Fire."" Susannah Grants movie is rough around the edges but once you get used to the laconic pace the plot grooves along nicely. The film is maybe 20 minutes too long but its filled with nice little moments that keep things interesting. This is the chick-flick version of listening to an Allman Brothers Band guitar solo. Garner is Gray whose husband-to-be died during a tragic accident that apparently happened during his bachelor party. It didnt involve strippers but as Gray starts handling his estate in Colorado she finds out her fiance wasnt a saint quietly supporting a Gordon Getty-esque secret family in Los Angeles. When Gray moves in with three of her fiances buddies shes forced to confront her anger toward his best friend Fritz (""Deadwood"" star Timothy Olyphant with hair that may actually be closer to Lowes in the ""Youngblood"" era) who also isnt what he seems. ""Catch and Release"" has several twists and turns for each character including Kevin Smith in kind of a sad clown role and Sam Jaeger as a friend who has a crush on Gray. (Also worth mentioning In one of the most random product placement agreements in history Celestial Seasonings tea figures significantly into the plot. If Columbia Pictures received a penny less than 3 million plus a lifetime supply of free Lemon Zinger for the cast and crew then the studios negotiators were asleep on the job.) Grant who got her start working on ""Party of Five"" is a better writer than director and at times whats on the screen seems television-quality. Former ""Alias"" star Garner seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role. Shes so much better with a script that calls for her to kick people and wear ridiculous wigs while infiltrating the Russian mafia. But Garners natural beauty and likability are still assets and the clever script gives a lot for the supporting players to do even as the plot sort of lurches along. Lewis is particularly amusing in a smaller role and Smith stands out as a cross between a ""Little House on the Prairie""-era Victor French and Chewbacca -- the best chemistry in the movie is between Smith and a 4-year-old boy. Even better the film doesnt rely on catastrophic developments repeated misunderstandings and big speeches to move events forward -- and unlike a lot of romantic comedies the original screenplay doesnt have the awkward edits and forced exposition that youll find when books are made into movies. ""Catch and Release"" is the cinema equivalent of a 45 record thats being played at 331/3 revolutions per minute -- and some people wont be able to get past the glacial pace. But even though the movie isnt spit-shined perfection it has a pleasant vibe and plenty of charm. -- Advisory This movie takes place in Boulder Colo. which looks nothing like it did when Mork and Mindy lived there. The film also contains strong language drug use and sexual content.

Jennifer Garner stars as Gray the shell-shocked intended. For reasons emotional as much as financial Gray moves in with the roommates of her late love who was co-owner of a Boulder Colo. fly-fisherman outfitter. All three of her fiances best friends are deeply smitten with her. And at least one knows that Fiance Had a Secret. It is Grays posthumous put-down of her would-be spouses vocation - the sportsmans practice of hooking a fish and then setting it free - that suggests the films title. But screenwriter Susannah Grant here making her feature directorial debut alludes also to the kind of guy who would land a gal and then throw her back into the river. You know the guy for whom romance is all about the pursuit and not at all about the relationship. So diffuse and confusing is the film though that I didnt know which guy she meant. Before distinguishing herself as the screenwriter of Erin Brockovich Ever After and In Her Shoes Grant wrote and directed episodes of Party of Five the TV show about the siblings whose parents died in a car accident (not unlike the precipitating event of Catch and Release). As her filmography shows Grant likes the sweet and sour scenario where romantic comedy and tragedy emulsify. Unfortunately here these elements congeal. Grants film plays like a two-hour episode of Friends intercut with Seventh Heaven. Those sounds you hear are wisecrack heartbreak heartbreak wisecrack wisecrack. Catch and Release has some appeal - winsome Garner; wisenheimer Kevin Smith (the Clerks writer-director plays one of Grays roomies); and cinegenic Boulder with its pristine rivers and mountains. Its a pity that Grant fails to establish a consistent tone. Gray whose dimples are as deep as the Rockies are high inexplicably has neither girlfriend nor parental shoulders to cry on. As consoling figures the friends of her late fiance come off as the Three Bears. Dennis (Sam Jaeger) is too introverted. Sam (Smith) is too extroverted. And Fritz (Timothy Olyphant) is too much the horndog. While Dennis quietly pines for her Sam is more obvious about his feelings. Hes the guy whose job is finding inspirational quotes for Red Zinger and Blueberry Breeze tea boxes (Celestial Seasonings is headquartered in Boulder) and Gray is his test case. Those who think Smith is surprisingly good as best friend might remember that in life thats his relation to Garners spouse Ben Affleck. However diverting are Garner Smith and the scenery (and heres a shout-out to legendary editor Anne V. Coates for her sharp cutting) the ricochet-romance aspect of Grants film is frankly icky. Doesnt the almost-widow get a chance to grieve before she moves on? Theres a psalm that says weeping may endure for the night but joy comes in the morning. This surely is the point of Grants film that grief paves the way to gladness. It would have been nice had she dramatized this insight instead of slapping the sentiment on the film as if it were a box of tea.

Two new men including Timothy Olyphant pictured quickly fall for her. By John Hartl Film critic msnbc.com updated 1/26/2007 11539 PM ET 2007-01-26T181539 Print Font + - REVIEW Jennifer Garner is primarily a television star thanks to five seasons of ""Alias"" but shes been making multiplex in-roads with ""Elektra"" and ""13 Going on 30"" and now ""Catch and Release"" a romantic comedy that dares to be melancholy. Its the most complex big-screen role shes had to date even if the movie has as many downs as ups. Its the kind of comedy-drama that doesnt always succeed in blending a variety of moods. Still its exceptionally well-cast and escapes predictability just often enough to become quite watchable and even during its final reel rather touching. Garner plays Gray a Boulder Colo. woman whose fiance Grady dies just before theyre scheduled to be married. The wedding day suddenly becomes a funeral day. The flower shop doesnt get the message in time and makes the wrong delivery. The wedding gifts are opened as if nothing had happened to change the tone of the event. The fiances shocked mother (Fiona Shaw) behaves badly suggesting that Gray is no longer part of the family. Writer-director Susannah Grant specializes in awkward inappropriate moments like that as Gray copes with grief by bonding with her dead fiances best friends and eventually moving in with them boisterous Sam (Kevin Smith) thoughtful Dennis (Sam Jaeger) and philandering Fritz (Timothy Olyphant) who behaves like a randy wedding crasher at the wake. The grooms secret life Theres a pall over the house and it grows as Dennis and Fritz fall for Gray who learns more about the supposedly saintly Grady than she wants to know. It turns out that he was supporting a child in Los Angeles where the boys mother Maureen (scene-stealing Juliette Lewis) worked as a massage therapist. When she turns up with the kid at their Colorado home the menage turns into an unruly crowd. Grant who makes her directing debut with ""Catch and Release"" previously wrote ""Erin Brockovich"" as well as the current remake of ""Charlottes Web"" and she definitely has a knack for off-the-wall soap opera. She delicately handles Dennis unrequited love for Gray as well as the tension that builds to a mutual attraction between Gray and Fritz. The fate of the child is treated with unusual sensitivity. At first the characters may not seem to be registering their loss but gradually they reveal how much is going on beneath the surface. Dennis does it by registering his disappointment that Grady wasnt perfect. Gray expresses it in a sudden confession of all the bad things shes done including her compulsive stealing of library books and other embarrassing habits. Fritz does it simply by admitting that he misses his best friend. ""Catch and Release"" could easily have been another arrested-development movie like ""The Breakup"" or ""Failure to Launch"" and there are times when it comes much too close to aping that dead-end genre. But Garner and Grant work hard to push the picture into unexplored territory and the cringe-worthy moments are easy to overlook.

The last time I trashed an overtly sentimental chick flick that my wife liked she asked me why I choose to review those movies. ""To protect my brothers"" I said. Really women drag their husbands and boyfriends to films like writer-director Susannah Grants emotionally bogus ""Catch and Release"" and I feel their pain. They should get a free Boys Night Out pass every time they make the sacrifice. Two passes may be in order for ""Catch and Release"" a film that a talented veteran of romantic comedy would have had trouble pulling off let alone a screenwriter (Grant wrote ""Erin Brockovich"") who has never directed a film before. ""Catch"" stars Jennifer Garner as Gray a woman whose fiance dies the day before their wedding leaving a fortune an improbably stupid mistress (Juliette Lewis) and an undisciplined young son whom Gray never knew he had as well as an even wealthier out-of-town friend with whom she is destined to find new romance. Grant creates characters and situations that dare you not to scoff. For instance the main setting for the film is a small rental cottage in Boulder Colo. that Gray shares with two longtime male roommates - gourmand Sam (Kevin Smith) and gloomy Dennis (Sam Jaeger) - and Fritz (Timothy Olyphant) an out-of-towner who crashes in his dead pals bed after the funeral. Three gainfully employed thirtysomething adults and a wealthy freeloader (Fritz is a successful filmmaker with a beach house in Malibu) sharing a squirrel hut like college buddies is ridiculous. (I hear the murmur of a female voice saying ""Yeah but one of them is Timothy Olyphant"") Smith who makes movies (""Clerks"") that he occasionally appears in plays the vulgar kindhearted Sam as if he were emulating John Belushis Bluto in ""Animal House."" The guy is either stuffing his face slugging back beers or preparing to do one or other in almost every scene. At least Smith gives the film a few moments of authenticity. His girth certainly matches his characters appetite. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Dont explain what happened what you meant or what you want. If you do well find out too soon just how thin this plot is and the movie will end too soon. So just dont. Instead offer a sad smile and walk away. This simple rule is the same one that allows TV soap operas to keep going day after day year after year. Someone says something - ""You must mean my amnesiac schizophrenic twin sister"" - and then walks out leaving the befuddled co-star to stare 10 degrees off-camera pondering the horrors to come in the near future. Such teasing wistful non-explanations populate the long-delayed ""Catch and Release"" a romantic comedy-drama with little comedy no drama and less romance than your average YouTube video. As lovelorn Grey Jennifer Garner must be kept constantly in the dark so that her film has a chance of lasting more than five minutes. As the movie opens Grey is dressed in black and greeting funeral guests. Turns out her fiance Grady - Grey and Grady theres a nowhere-but- Hollywood pairing for you - died on an adventure trip just before they were to marry. The remaining characters are supposed to explore Gradys past and plan their own futures. Think of ""The Big Chill"" minus the great writing the enormous acting talent the wit or the soundtrack of that seminal film. Weve traded the best of Motown for some nondescript annoying acoustic guitar strumming. Thats not to say the filmmakers are not enamored of their own soundtrack - they seem to love it so much or distrust their own dialogue even more that they let those fey guitars drown out more than one conversation. Spoiler warning here The plot description to follow happens very early in the movie but if you insist on seeing ""Catch and Release"" and dont want to know anything please enjoy our Sudoku page. Gradys past includes more money ex-girlfriends and illegitimate children than poor skinny Grey had counted on in her upstanding fiance. Gradys best friend Fritz played by Timothy Olyphant of HBOs ""Deadwood"" sticks around to supply information in infuriating dribs and drabs. Slight slapstick comic relief is provided by Kevin Smith taking a break from directing ""Clerks 14"" and Sam Jaeger as Grey and Gradys best friends. Smith has his moments though writer-director Susannah Grant regrettably resorts to another rule Bachelors who mix drinks in blender must forget to put the cover on before pressing ""mix."" Isnt there enough of that on Nickelodeon? Much of ""Catch and Release"" was filmed in and around Boulder or Flatiron facsimiles. There are brief moments of recognition for the audience in a shady bridge on the CU campus or a shot of Pearl Street with the Flatirons looming like friendly retrievers in the background. On the other hand if the rest of the world believes Boulderites are this vapid CU grads are in for long job hunts. Im not necessarily a great judge of chemistry - I thought Ross Perot-Admiral Stockdale was pure heat. But I am fairly certain Garner-Olyphant doesnt have it. Garner looks about 17 and the script gives her about as much depth as ""But Im a Cheerleader."" Olyphant is drop-dead beautiful heck even I have a man-crush on the guy but hes a 25-watt bulb on a dimmer switch severely restricted by building management. He smiles and we wait for something else to happen and we wait and we wait. Still waiting. When they finally hit the bed together - oops spoiler warning - Grant breaks up the screen in the oddest ways. The shot looks like nothing so much as a kaleidoscope fornicating with a prayer wheel. Only in Boulder I guess. Grant has talent so Im not sure how all this happened. Before taking up directing she wrote scripts for ""Erin Brock- ovich"" and last years gem ""In Her Shoes."" With ""Catch and Release"" its clear she hasnt yet matched the rhythm of her shooting and editing eye to the snappy allure of her writing.

"Garner and friends only skim the surface in Catch - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Garner and friends only skim the surface in Catch By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  January 26 2007 Not to put too fine a point on it but ""Catch and Release"" is the chick-flick version of guy-cry movies like ""Garden State "" and ""The Last Kiss. "" Like them it features underdrawn yet quirky characters onto which a youthful audience can project its anxieties. Like them it uses an iPod playlist in place of story structure and like them it knows there are no easy answers but gives them to us anyway. The films a pleasant enough daydream before it turns all squoodgy at the end.Jennifer Garner oddly coming off as a bit of a roadshow Julia Roberts plays Gray Wheeler a Boulder Colo. woman whose wedding plans turn funereal when her fiance is killed during a bachelor party boating accident. We never see him -- the movies about her road back to the land of the living -- and its just as well since the more of his secrets we learn the more Gray and we want to give him a sharp kick.""Catch and Release"" focuses mostly on her friendships with his surviving circle of buddies. There are three of them Dopey Grumpy and Hunky played respectively by Kevin Smith (the director of ""Clerks"" in a rare acting-only role) Sam Jaeger  and Timothy Olyphant (""Deadwood"") whose constant three-day stubble is a miracle fashioned by God himself.Dopey and Grumpy -- their names are Sam and Dennis really -- live together and I spent most of the movie assuming they were a couple especially given Smiths penchant for muumuu -size bathrobes. Theyre just roommates though despite the marital squabbling; all three men burn a torch for the grieving near-widow and when Gray moves in with the boys tiptoeing around those emotions becomes deafening.As written and directed by Susannah Grant the writer of ""Erin Brockovich "" and more pertinently ""Ever After"" and ""In Her Shoes"" ""Catch and Release"" wears its heart on its peasant-blouse sleeve and it has a fondness toward most of its characters that other movies would do well to emulate. Grant knows life can be an unholy mess and shes attentive to that mess until she just cant help grabbing a dustpan and start cleaning up.In the process Gray thaws from a perfectionist wife-in - waiting to a sloppier happier better human being. So were led to believe anyway but ""Catch and Release"" never convinces us there was a real person there to begin with. Gray has no parents no female friends a vague job at a desk somewhere but no career -- shes an outline Grant hasnt bothered to fill in. Garner gives her a lik able personality but little depth or force of character. Shes all elegant elongated lines like a beautiful and slightly puzzled Afghan hound.The male roles are marginally richer; certainly theyre funnier. Smith tries to carve out a new niche for himself as a wacky best friend and comes fairly close. Smiths character Sam works for Celestial Seasonings where he comes up with literary quotes for boxes of tea. Even his suicide attempts are cute. Olyphant in the not-so-bad-boy role twinkles charmingly until all of a sudden and through no real fault of his own it stops being charming.Theres a funkier and more interesting movie in Maureen a character played by Juliette Lewis. Maureen is a single mom a massage therapist and a dimwit California follower of every new-age theory out there. Shes a nasal needy wreck and ""Catch and Release"" is torn between adoring her and making ruthless fun of her.Ultimately the movies a romantic melodrama in the vein of a 1930s womens picture or a 1950 s true-love comedy. Not that theres anything wrong with that although both those forms had a pulpy conviction ""Catch and Release"" is too timid to embrace. The film is as sensitive and unchallenging as its strumalong soundtrack the soft-focus playlist of Grays life. Id be more interested in hearing Maureens playlist but it probably wouldnt sell as many CDs.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

"Catch and Release No Bait on the Hook washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Catch and Release No Bait on the Hook Timothy Olyphant and Jennifer Garner in a romantic comedy thats not sure what it wants to be. (By Doug Curran -- Columbia Pictures Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 26 2007 Caught dead center in the confused effort ""Catch and Release"" is Jennifer Garner playing a young woman who ends up attending the funeral of her fiance on what would have been their wedding day. Throughout this story -- which teeter-totters between traditional rom-com and semi-downer ensemble piece -- Garner retains a permanent grimace as if persuasive acting can be achieved by contorting cheek muscles and pouting lips. Its not just depressing to watch her its tiring. We want to tell her to relax -- for our own relief. Moviegoers who have come to see Garner get down and flirty perhaps remembering her sweet turn in 2004s ""13 Going on 30"" will soon find themselves shifting in their seats. By the time she lightens up well the credits arent far away. Writer-turned-director Susannah Grant -- she scripted ""Erin Brockovich"" -- apparently delayed the final shooting schedule for a year to accommodate Garners final season on TVs ""Alias"" and the birth of the actresss child. Clearly Grant should have used the lag time for creative troubleshooting. As Garners Gray Wheeler discovers shady things about her dead fiances romantic past she seems headed for a restorative romance with one of his friends. No sooner have we settled in for this development when another seemingly more appropriate suitor rears his head. We become seriously lost as to which romance we are supposed to be rooting for as if Grant changed her mind too but couldnt be bothered to go back and re-adapt the first half of the movie. Then theres the stylistic approach On one hand ""Catch"" slavishly follows traditional romancers such as ""My Best Friends Wedding"" in which Mr. Real turns out to be Mr. Unexpected. But on the other it wants to enjoy the indie-movie structure of ""Garden State"" and feature offbeat characters in a cluster of overlapping stories -- all to the incessant beat of pop songs on the soundtrack. Unfortunately for the latter approach none of Grants supporting characters is as quirkily engaging as she wants them to be. Juliette Lewis ""Deadwood"" star Timothy Olyphant and ""Clerks"" filmmaker Kevin Smith are as handicapped by their own limitations as by whats on their script pages. Olyphant is the strongest performer here but hes entirely misplaced an estimable actor caught in a thankless frilly role. Smith is only fitfully funny as he spends most of the movie stuffing his face and running his well-known New Jersey-bred improv motors. And Lewis simply reprises the interplanetary weirdness she has used ever since she batted eyes at Robert De Niro in 1991s ""Cape Fear."" None of them can make up for the movies conceptual problems. Which brings us back to the movies leading lady. The engaging almost giddy innocence she brought to ""13 Going on 30"" and the super-agent vitality she brought to ""Alias"" are conspicuously absent here -- in large part because Grants script keeps her character fettered by bereavement. It all conspires to keep her from being the lovable center of the story. Audiences come to romantic stories -- bubbly bittersweet or even dark -- to see the resurgence that love brings to the soul. But as directed by Grant Garner never gets the chance to enjoy that transformation. Perkier actresses from the rom-com corner -- the Julias Camerons and Drews -- surely would have used their power or cachet to insist on some crucial rewrites that would give the character a more engaging quality throughout the film. And when Grant does try to imbue Garner with spark -- in one scene the actress slurs a drunken rendition of ""Mamas Dont Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys"" -- her efforts feel forced or hackneyed. As a result Garner simply disappears into the supporting pack in a film that doesnt know if its rom-coming or going. Catch and Release (111 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for profanity and sexual situations.

"Catch and Release | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; catch-and-release ) Catch and Release (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Catch and Release is a confused disjointed motion picture that tries to be many things and succeeds in being none. In less than two hours (although it feels considerably longer) writer/director Susannah Grant cobbles together nearly every imaginable plot element and device except the kitchen sink (although she manages to get the bathtub in there). Despite possessing a few effective and affecting scenes Catch and Release is a mess and the methods it uses to bring closure to its diverse storylines feel trite and contrived. Leaving the theater I was struck with a sense that the movie not only could have been better but it should have been so. Gray Wheeler (Jennifer Garner) is having a nightmare of a wedding day. Instead of walking down the aisle she is burying her husband-who-would-have-been who perished during his bachelor party. For Gray its a devastating blow thats made worse when she discovers that her beloved was keeping secrets from her including a child fathered with a massage therapist (Juliette Lewis) in California. Meanwhile the grooms closest male friends are reacting differently to the death. Sam (Kevin Smith) tries to kill himself. Dennis (Sam Jaeger) throws himself into ensuring Grays well being. And Fritz (Timothy Olyphant) has casual sex with a caterer at the funeral. Grays strong dislike of Fritz makes it inevitable that he will become her romantic interest as the film veers off course into perfunctory formulaic romantic comedy territory. Ostensibly the main storyline of Catch and Release is about how Gray copes with learning about her fiancA(c)s secrets after his death. Unfortunately this noble quest spins off a number of less interesting subplots Sams relationship with the mother of the dead mans son Dennis infatuation with Gray and the Fritz/Gray coupling. The romantic element is the least effective and the most forced. Theres no chemistry between Jennifer Garner and Timothy Olyphant and the romance is never believable. The movie doesnt show us these two falling in love. Were supposed to accept it on faith because theyre mismatched they make goo-goo eyes at each other and they sleep together. Maybe that s all the writer/director has time for because shes so busy beefing up all the skeletal subplots that surround this one. The cast doesnt excel. In the right role Jennifer Garner can be effective. This is not the right role. Shes good while in tears but at no other time could her performance be considered memorable. As a romantic lead she lacks the spark to ignite a fire. Timothy Olyphant is awful seeming to believe all thats necessary for his part is to offer a smarmy smile and look like a reject from a Grease casting call. Kevin Smith is adequate sidekick material although hes on thin ice when the movie requires him to do something dramatic. Hes also not as funny as one might expect. And Juliette Lewis is her usual annoying self appearing in far too many scenes. Nearly every intended instance of humor fails indicating that Catch and Release should have been positioned as a straight drama. Whatever her talents Susannah Grant isnt good with comedy. (This is her feature debut. Her previous credits as a screenwriter include Erin Brockovich and In Her Shoes.) Her cast isnt top notch but its unfair to blame them for being unable to do much with her unfocused screenplay. Theres little substance and less entertainment value. Good scenes such as the one in which Gray flees the funeral for a moment of solitude are more than counterbalanced by sequences that dont work or are embarrassing (Dennis admission to Gray the ""give back the ring"" request Fritzs overhearing Grays lie about their relationship). Because so little of it works the film is disposable. One suspects that since few viewers are likely to catch this movie its release will be short lived at least until it makes its way to DVD.

Neither as bad as its early buzz and January berth would suggest nor as good as it should have been ""Catch and Release"" is a so-so romantic dramedy about a woman (Jennifer Garner) finding love in the wake of her fiances accidental death. True to its name largely forgettable item should register as a brief theatrical catch -playing to limited femme-driven B.O. -- before its hastened release on DVD racks. The helming debut of scribe Susannah Grant (""Erin Brockovich"") who also penned it ""Catch and Release"" was originally slated for an April 2006 release. But Sony seeking to lighten its marketing load (Daily Variety Jan. 12 2006) opted for a nine-month postponement. Yet despite the negative implications of its delay ""Catch and Release"" isnt wholly irredeemable. Garner is characteristically engaging as Gray Wheeler the Boulder Colo.-based bride whose wedding turns into a funeral when her b.f. Grady perishes during a pre-marital boating accident (alluded to only obliquely). A maudlin intro sequence at the reception sets up key characters including the devastated Gray Gradys weepy mother (Fiona Shaw) and the would-be groomsmen buffoonish Sam (Kevin Smith channeling Jack Black) sincere Dennis (Sam Jaeger) and the rakish Fritz (""Deadwoods"" Timothy Olyphant) who deals with his grief by seducing the caterer. Unable to afford the house she and Grady had rented Gray moves in with Sam and Dennis who are also lodging Fritz. While this plot point accelerates the story it begs the question Why doesnt Gray have girlfriends or family of her own? Its inconceivable that a woman would undergo such a catastrophic loss without so much as a call from her mother let alone her bridesmaids. Once ensconced with the guys Gray bonds with Sam and Dennis each of whom manifests his grief differently the former gorging himself on food and vodka the latter throwing himself into the construction of a memorial ""Peace Garden."" Though Gray initially loathes the self-centered playboy Fritz (having overheard his tryst with the caterer) surprising events -- and his hitherto untapped sensitivity -- will bring them together. Its giving little away to say that Gray discovers Grady had a secret bank account from which he made regular payments to a California massage therapist named Maureen (Juliette Lewis) who had borne his son (Joshua Friesen). Stung by that revelation (and by Maureens description of her as ""perfect"") Gray resolves to be a little more edgy. She begins a clandestine affair with Fritz that blossoms into something unexpected. And she overcomes her resistance to the ditsy Maureen and her oh-so precious son. One of the troubles with ""Catch and Release"" is that it deals with serious issues -- sudden death grief infidelity deception -- in a fairly lighthearted way. What makes that worse is that there are a few moments when the film actually approaches some kind of emotional or dramatic truth. Olyphant and Garner generate real sparks and their should-we-or-shouldnt-we attraction feels authentic. Ditto the Sam-Dennis friendship in which men unable to articulate their emotions resort to shows of physical strength. Alternatively several running gags grow tedious. If ""Catch and Release"" was a complete loss its flaws wouldnt be as glaring. Grant can write and shows promise as a director but shes not served by her material or its serio-comic tone here. Theres no problem with her cast however although Lewis could have taken her ditsy persona down a notch; shes like the choral voice that threatens to drown out the others. Garner wont lose any fans and Olyphant clearly has a bright future. Tech elements are fine across the board. Theres a hip soundtrack including songs from the Lemonheads and Foo Fighters but it sometimes feels like the songs are turned up when the story starts to falter.
