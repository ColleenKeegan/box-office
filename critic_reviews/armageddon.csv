Comments Armageddon 150 minutes Its strictly a side issue whether mankind will survive colliding with an asteroid the size of Texas; the real question is whether Liv Tyler who plays Bruce Williss daughter gets to keep her boyfriend (Ben Affleck). Not wishing to spoil the fun--pretty hard to come by anyway in this 1998 blockbusters 150 minutes--I wont tell you the outcome but Ill wager you can guess. Basically this is The Dirty Dozen meets When Worlds Collide a grubby team of oil drillers headed by Willis is dispatched to save the planet by nuking the asteroid from within. Michael Bay who was more comfortable with the subtleties of The Rock is director and coproducer and among the credited and uncredited writers--all of them clearly encouraged to work in their sleep--are Jonathan Hensleigh J.J. Abrams Tony Gilroy Shane Salerno Robert Roy Pool Robert Towne Paul Attanasio Ann Biderman and Scott Rosenberg. Others in the cast who embarrass themselves and us for their salaries include Billy Bob Thornton Keith David Steve Buscemi Chris Ellis Will Patton and Jason Isaacs.

While the media capital of the world picks up the pieces Washington decides to impose a news blackout until it can come up with a solution to the looming problem.As an exercise in premillennial paranoia Armageddon is as shallow as Deep Impact but those who enjoy the trademark ingredients of a Jerry Bruckheimer production will no doubt be satisfied. The rockets that lift the crew charged with saving the planet are fueled by testosterone the humor is truculently macho the film is edited at blink-of-an-eye speed for MTV attention spans and the sound track is ear-numbing. The special effects are the best that 150 million can buy and the script plays like a near-afterthought.An asteroid the size of Texas is hurtling Earthward at 22000 m.p.h. It will wipe out life on the planet in 18 days. No fewer than nine writers - five credited with various facets of the script - toiled on this apocalyptic premise. Instead of coming up with an idea we could all get behind like dispatching a team of Indian and Pakistani atomic scientists with a one-way ticket to do their nuclear testing on the asteroid Armageddon offers a crew of roughneck oil-drillers laconically led by Bruce Willis.The scenarists included the legendary Robert Towne the one-man ER of Hollywood script doctors but not even he can sell this preposterous proposition. Perhaps realizing the impossibility the writers amuse themselves with various spins on The Dirty Dozen.This sets Armageddon apart from Deep Impact which represents a good start except for the fact that Deep Impacts end of the world also promises that we wont have to watch any more of Tea Leonis woefully feeble acting. Armageddon takes a more proactive direction but one that turns out to be equally silly.These days any bit of looniness in a movie can be explained as the work of the government. At first glance the idea that Washington would entrust the future of humanity to a bunch of misfits and spaced-out miscreants sent on a last desperate voyage into outer space is ludicrous. At second glance as they load their nuclear weapons and take off it begins to look truly absurd.Making the transition from The Rock to a much bigger pile of stone director Michael Bay decides that the best course is to keep his foot on the accelerator and to crank up the volume. Armageddon wants to be fast and loud but its 2 1/2-hour running time leaves what are supposed to be its more personal scenes cruelly exposed.Poor Liv Tyler is stuck among the boys and their high-tech toys as Willis daughter. An especially weak subplot has Willis mad at Ben Affleck his strong right arm on the drilling rigs for romancing his little girl. Willis is an expert in this kind of role but unlike his Die Hard outings Armageddon gives him nothing to play off.After Willis and his lads have mercilessly dissed NASA geeks and Pentagon pinheads during their training Armageddon does a drastic about-face and gives them a teary-eyed heros farewell that Ron Howard would surely have considered too much for Apollo 13. Once in space the films special effects wizards come into their own and their work is first-rate.In an early moment of Armageddon its creators take a swipe at what was supposed to be their major summer rival by having a dog attack a vendors Godzilla merchandise on a New York street. Now its like kicking a lizard when hes down from a production thats guilty of some of the same flaws. All we can hope is that Armageddon means that the end of end-of-the-world movies is at hand.ARMAGEDDON   1/2 Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer Gale Anne Hurd and Michael Bay; directed by Bay; written by Jonathan Hensleigh and J.J.

Bruce Willis Ben Affleck Billy Bob Thornton Liv Tyler Steve Buscemi. Directed by Michael Bay. Running time 144 mins. At area theaters following midnight screening tonight at Loews 84th St. Rated PG-13. 2 STARS THE END OF THE WORLD is going to be very noisy and filled with some of the worst dialogue ever. Thats the promise of ""Armageddon"" a silly chaotic disaster movie in which an asteroid thats larger than the one in ""Deep Impact"" hurtles our way. ""Its what we call a global killer"" is one breathless description revealing the outer limits of technical jargon. What you need in an emergency like this is ""the worlds best deep-core driller"" hows that for a manly title? and he happens to be Bruce Willis. ""Ive been drilling holes for 30 years and I have never missed a depth I have aimed for"" he announces passionately at a critical juncture in the movie. Doesnt exactly rank with ""As God is my witness Ill never go hungry again"" Willis plays Harry Stamper champion oil driller overprotective father the guy who is chosen by Billy Bob Thornton of NASA to swing around the moon land on the asteroid drill a big hole insert a nuke and push the on button. Its not too complicated a plot so the film makers have added a tedious second act in which our heroes Harry and his hand-picked team of losers misfits and Ben Affleck dock at an orbiting gas station and immediately get into trouble. Its a little unclear whether they come away from that muddled fiasco with a full tank or not; in any case not all of them are playing with a full deck. (Steve Buscemi for example is so excited to be on an asteroid they have to tie him down like the airborne serial killer he played in ""Con Air."") In the other subplot that gunks up the works Harry catches his nubile daughter (Liv Tyler) in bed with his foreman (Affleck). Harry cant handle that daddys little girl is all grown up and this leads to some inadvertently riotous conversation such as ""I shouldnt have dragged you around to all those oil rigs"" Which is not to cast aspersions on the other inadvertently funny lines like the one from Harry ""Blow me and my friends up is that it?"" Or when one crew members ex-wife says to their son when they catch sight of the newly canonized Will Patton on TV ""That mans not a salesman honey thats your daddy"" The subtext of the movie is that unglamorous workaday jobs are just as demanding and worthy of respect as say being an astronaut. (Note that you can send an oil driller into space but you cant turn an astronaut into a driller on short notice.) The one department where ""Armageddon"" really shines is in its comic relief. ""Henry"" says one wryly observant crew member ""the clock on that 9-foot nuclear weapon is ticking"" Buscemi king of the indies uses wisecracks to relieve the tedium between meaningless explosions. Despite Thorntons assurance that ""This is as real as it gets"" reality is the last thing youll find on the screen of ""Armageddon."" (PG-13 Violence.)

"Armageddon Related Item Go to Video Finder Armageddons Big Bang Theory By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 3 1998 Bruce Willis trys to save Earth from ""Armageddon."" (Touchstone) Director Michael Bay Cast Bruce Willis; Ben Affleck; Billy Bob Thornton; Steve Buscemi; Liv Tyler; Will Patton Running Time 2 hours 31 minutes Children under 13 should be accompanied by a parent Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa Whew. Like a white-water ride on a Class V rapid ""Armageddon"" is a loud long and bumpy experience. It might make you tense it might make you nauseous and its clangorous roar could well give you a migraine headache. Then again when its all over you might just want to throw up in a bucket buy another ticket and get back in the boat for a second adrenaline-stoked slide down that swollen stream. Allow a day for recovery however because the nearly three-hour film is emotionally and physically exhausting. Its an intensely visceral pleasure not unmixed with pain like the multiple g-force acceleration experienced by an astronaut during lift-off. ""Armageddon"" peels your eyelids back and blows your eardrums out until rational analysis is moot. In ""Armageddon"" the trip is courtesy of an asteroid traveling 22000 miles per hour straight for Earth. Your guide on the journey? That lunk-headed Everyman Bruce Willis whose interchangeable heroics serve equally well on a boat a plane a train or a rocket ship. Here Willis plays Harry S. Stamper a larger-than-life character based on oil-field legend Red Adair. Harrys 30 years of expertise as a drilling virtuoso are called into service by the U.S. government when NASA wakes up to find a humongous rock less than a month away from a rendezvous with our planets atmosphere. How did the pros miss this ""global killer"" until it was virtually breathing down our necks? Evil budgetary cutbacks according to the space agencys executive director Dan Truman played with stoicism and methodical resolve by an unshaven Billy Bob Thornton. As the pocket-protector brigade at NASA explains it at this late stage the only solution is to send up Harry and his motley crew of roughnecks dig a very deep hole drop a nuke in it and get the heck out of there. Unlike the identically premised ""Deep Impact"" which focused on the touchy-feely emotions of the folks back on Earth producer Jerry Bruckheimer and his directorial protege Michael Bay (""Bad Boys"" ""The Rock"") have wisely elected to concentrate the action on the asteroid itself and the drama of the people who are sweating to save humanity. Like ""The Dirty Dozen"" these so-called ""retards"" and ""criminals"" cover all bases of the reluctant cinematic hero theres decent right-hand man Chick (Will Patton) hot-dogger A.J. (Ben Affleck) space cowboy Oscar (Owen Wilson) horny genius Rockhound (Steve Buscemi) Max the fat one (Ken Campbell) Bear the African American one (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Freddy the expendable one (Clark Brolly). If all goes well the asteroid will crack into two pieces that will brush harmlessly past us. Needless to say all does not go well. Once on the rock just about everything unexpected that can happen does except for the sci-fi cliche where the ground underfoot turns out to be the back of some scaly beast. Viewers may be forgiven for thinking so however because of the eerie moaning and groaning emanating from the speeding stone. Its 200 degrees in the sun 200 below zero in the shade and the surface is covered with razor sharp rocks. In other words as one of Harrys crew describes it ""its the scariest environment imaginable."" Its also hyperactive and deafeningly loud. In the tradition of Bruckheimer excess perfected with his late partner Don Simpson in such films as ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Top Gun"" the camera never stands still. The sound of a flash bulb popping is amplified until it resembles the detonation of a bomb. (Imagine the cacophony of a meteor shower.) Huge passages of shouted dialogue are swallowed by the din with no detriment to the sense of the plot. This is not a movie where words matter. It is no accident that the asteroid in ""Armageddon"" is described as ""the size of Texas"" a state where even the jackrabbits are said to be as big as horses. In this outsize movie every little thing is jumbo-from the chunks of the Chrysler Building that are knocked off by the meteorites in the very first scene to the wall-sized Old Glory seen framed behind the lovely Liv Tyler who as Harrys daughter and A.J.s fiance Grace is emblematic of what our American boys are fighting to save in the first place. In this movie of big shoulders there is no room for puny emotions. The tepid and perfunctory love scene between A.J. and Grace where he inexplicably slips an animal cracker under the waistband of her panties has no more depth than a music video. But the special effects are stupendous and the suspense is palpable. By the films ending (shot like one of those schmaltzy IBM ""global village"" commercials) you may resent the fact that every imaginable button of yours has been pushed raw but you will be powerless to lift a finger to stop it.

Please do NOT confuse this with Deep Impacts comet the size of New York.Two entirely different things.If this asteroid hits the Earth were told itll kill a lot of people instantly. Many more will perish in the resulting ``nuclear winter and the rest will die in ways that only God knows.God and presumably Pat Robertson.Armageddon which opens today was directed and co-produced by Michael Bay who also directed The Rock. Another co-producer is Jerry Buckheimer whose resume includes The Rock (1996) and Con Air (1997).I hated both of those movies not only because of their often-incoherent action sequences but also because they struck me as exploitative and even sadistic. They appeared to revel in the suffering they inflicted on their characters.Armageddons action scenes are also sometimes incoherent but the movie isnt sadistic. Or at least its no more sadistic than a film can be that depicts the destruction of at least one of the planets great population centers.Maybe its Armageddons PG-13 rating (the other two were R) or the influence of the third co-producer Gale Anne Hurd (Aliens) but the whole project seems relatively benign. Or to put a less positive spin on it relatively bland.Its hard to say which description is more accurate Armageddon is the weirdest combination of the absolutely horrible and the surprisingly watchable.The films action scenes are indeed sometimes tough to follow. But the special effects are generally impressive. And while character development is next to nil (as it is in most Bruckheimer-related movies) the characters are certainly colorful.Bruce Willis brings his raffish charm to the role of Harry S. Stamper an ace oil driller who is recruited by NASAs director (Billy Bob Thornton of Sling Blade) to save the world.Its up to Stamper and his dirty dozen (or so) oil-drilling ``roughnecks to fly up to the asteroid drill a hole in it drop a nuke down that sucker and get the heck out of Dodge before it blows. Sounds simple enough but the plot - which seems to have been designed by committee - contains so many complications for Stampers crew that it may have been intended to prove Murphys Law.One law that the filmmakers have ignored is the one against theft. But that too is standard for a Bruckheimer production.No I dont just mean the new films Deep Impact-like premise. Theres also a Chrysler Building decapitation that recalls the one in Godzilla (not to mention a gag involving toy monsters that is made at Godzillas expense).Stampers entire mission - with its planning and training stages and its multiple missteps - seems like Apollo 13 on steroids right down to Stampers admonition to mission control``Houston you have a problem.Even the romance between Stampers daughter (Liv Tyler of Inventing the Abbotts) and one of his roughnecks (Ben Affleck of Good Will Hunting) appears culled from Titanic. Stamper you see naturally thinks that his daughter deserves someone more cultivated.Theres a lot of very solemn stuff in this film. Stiff-upper-lip dialogue about facing the end of the world and father-daughter encounters of the manipulative kind.But then just when you think youve had it with this movie there comes a farcical rock n roll sort of comedy sequence or a hilariously goofy line by the roughnecks resident mad genius (Steve Buscemi of Fargo and Con Air) or the groups spaced-out flake (Owen Wilson of Bottle Rocket).

Apparently it is no longer enough to put the audience on the proverbial roller coaster; extreme movies such as Michael Bays The Rock and his latest opus Armageddon have to rattle our bones. Now when we go to these movies the THX-juiced sound reverberates through us till our insides tremble and the images flicker so rapidly we dont dare look away. Unlike Alex in A Clockwork Orange we no longer need to be strapped down to experience the full benefits of the Ludovico treatment. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Everything in extreme movies is fast faster fastest - the cutting the camera moves the exposition. But theres nothing thrilling about the pace. (Remember when A Hard Days Night seemed like the fastest-cut movie in the world? It was.) Its not even a question of speed for the sake of speed just a question of keeping our attention; no wonder so many reviewers use the word ""riveting."" If you slowed a movie like Armageddon down you might just notice how the story makes no sense - why isnt the rest of the world as involved as the United States in saving the planet? - and youd notice really notice how Bruce Willis face seems to have set into a permanent puffy sneer. Even when a tear trickles down his face it rolls into the crease of his disdain. It makes you wonder Is it us he hates or himself?Not that it matters. The audience of hyperventilated kids I saw Armageddon with seemed to love the movie They cheered Bruce sneer and all. They cheered the special effects and Willis younger co-star Ben Affleck who was trying to do some acting. They even cheered when the hard-working character actor Steve Buscemi came onscreen and flashed his bad teeth. (Buscemi knows better than to act in movies like this.) The audience was incredibly pumped up as if it were at a playoff or a stadium concert - so much so that when the lights didnt go down 20 minutes after the film was supposed to start I briefly wondered if there might be a riot. There wasnt of course because the audience at this screening was mainly well-behaved if rowdy middle-class kids wearing nearly identical clothes and yelling in unison at all the right moments. It was the sort of audience movie executives dream of.Armageddon is the second Hollywood movie of the summer about an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. The first the lugubrious and deeply dull Deep Impact has been a surprising commercial success perhaps because it takes such a limp attitude toward the impending end of the world. Only in the films concluding 30 minutes does anyone work up a head of steam over the prospect of total annihilation. Until then its just kind of a bummer which is why it feels like it was made by Clinton Democrats. Armageddon in contrast is a no-bullshit take-no-prisoners movie the sort of nutso extravaganza John Milius might make if he were not only loony but untalented. No wonder the first voice we hear is that of Charlton Heston. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm The best that can be said for Armageddon is that it isnt trying to be about anything; its as close to pure cinema as Hollywood gets. The movie blows stuff up then takes only 10 minutes to introduce its characters and explain how everyone will die if the comet isnt destroyed. Then more stuff blows up. Deep Impact takes an hour to put the pieces into place then waits another hour for Tea Leoni to whimper ""Daddy."" There is a family in Armageddon too but theyre just movie stars pretending to be people Harry (Willis) an oil-rig owner his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) and her boyfriend A.J. (Affleck). Clearly the only reason the threesome exists is to make Willis seem human and to distract the pre-teens in the audience from realizing hes older than their fathers.The plot - as if it mattered - centers on a NASA official (Billy Bob Thornton) who hires a team of oil-riggers (Willis Affleck some others) to drill a hole in the comet. As with Deep Impact the idea is to nuke the asteroid before it hits Earth. NASA and the oil-riggers are the good guys everyone else in the government is bad. The story is without a doubt ridiculous but since the special effects are actually quite impressive that seems a small point. Still special effects arent what set Armageddon apart from other extreme movies such as Face/Off (an extreme movie with pedigree) or Con Air (arguably the apotheosis of extreme movies). Whats stunning about Armageddon is all the really terrible filmmaking squeezed in between the effects and the explosions. In the end thats what makes it one of the most fascinating studio movies of the year and also makes it so demented.Michael Bay remarkably seemed to think he was making a movie. That becomes clear not in the two-minute interludes with Grace and A.J. scattered throughout but in the images of whats meant to be the rest of humanity. These dewy snapshots - a boy staring up at the sky a father and child a family massed before a TV - have the honey glaze of a perfect Kodak moment. (Bay even rips off the Robert Frank photograph of people standing at windows next to an American flag re-creating the famous image without any of the originals pathos or irony.) No other scene better exemplifies Bays candied truth than a shot of some American kids sandwiched into one of those we-are-the-world montages of the Earths inhabitants - which here translates into mainly white rural America and various brown peoples picturesquely arranged in front of backdrops familiar from ATamp;T commercials. The camera catches the kids running in slo-mo and flying toy NASA spaceships just as they turn the corner of a building emblazoned with a miraculously well-preserved poster of a smiling JFK the words ""peace"" and ""freedom"" flanking his beatitude. Its a staggering moment of kitsch all the more staggering because it makes no sense either in relation to the movies quasi-libertarian posturing or its putative narrative. The shot just is.Most of the time Armageddon simply makes your head hurt. Its only in tableaux like the one starring JFK godhead of NASA that the movie offers any relief from its own pounding resolve basically because its the only time the action quiets enough for your thoughts to collect. Which seems to be the point. Were not meant to think about Armageddon; that as some will inevitably remind us is why its called a popcorn movie.Nearly 30 years ago in her essay ""Trash Art and the Movies"" Pauline Kael relieved her readers by telling them it was okay to love bad movies just as it was okay not to love those sold as art. Art Kael wrote is simply that something extra weve always gotten from good movies not just those with subtitles. Kael was legitimizing Hollywood letting us know it offered us as much as the films of Europe. She wrote ""Trash Art and the Movies"" in 1969 and it was a polemic for both its time and the postmodern moment around the corner. Decades later though Kaels bad movies are looking a lot better; they actually look like classics. These days nobody goes to Hollywood movies expecting anything like art (thats what the new very terrible Hal Hartley film is for) but neither do we get much in the way of craft technique style or coherency. Which begs the question Whats left? Once we went to the movies to escape the world; now theres no escaping - from the world or bad movies.

"Having An Asteroid Destroy The Earth Should Always Be This Much Fun - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs MOVIE REVIEW.Having An Asteroid Destroy The Earth Should Always Be This Much FunJuly 01 1998|By Michael Wilmington Tribune Movie Critic.If youre going to blow up the world -- or advertise your intentions to do so -- you might as well have some laughs along the way.And while youre at it you might as well stick in lots of glamor violence and sex drugs and rock n roll. Party hearty before the big blowup Thats the motto of ""Armageddon"" the latest action extravaganza from producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""Top Gun"" ""The Rock"" ""Con Air"").This exploding thrill-ride movie about an attempt to save the world from a killer asteroid quite rightly has been described by its makers as ""The Dirty Dozen in Outer Space."" Accept ""Armageddon"" in that half-kidding spirit and youll probably have a good time watching it -- as long as youre not allergic to rapid-fire editing glitzed-up cinematography an endless stream of apocalyptic wisecracks or the sight of Bruce Willis glowering.This film is a perfect example of high-style TV advertising techniques applied to the movies. It looks like a TV ad or 200 of them strung together with the same kind of gaudy virtuosity lavish technique and expensive self-mockery tinging every shot. But its also the modern equivalent of one of the silent movie melodramas where a curly haired heroine is tied to the railroad tracks while a locomotive roars toward her and a desperate hero races to the rescue. Here Earth is tied to the tracks. And Willis and a gang of ragtag oil-rig workers who look like police lineup refugees are the anti-heroes sent to save the world.""Armageddon"" uses the same end-of-the-world gimmick as the recent big hit ""Deep Impact"" -- the notion of an asteroid or comet on a collision course with Earth. This is the most plausible end-of-the-world scenario of all -- though plausibility is not really this movies strong suit (or intention).After spotting the Armageddon asteroid at almost the last minute and rejecting a few options -- such as trying to nuke the heavenly projectile (which at the speed its traveling would have little effect) -- NASA executive director Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) decides to send up the worlds best deep-core oil drillers to land on the surface of the asteroid drill and plant the bomb inside where it will do maximum damage. (This is not as crazy as it sounds -- though an actual NASA operation like this would be measured in months or years not the week or two presented here.)The group they get are hot-tempered Harry S. Stampers boys with oil-rig boss Stamper (Willis) yowling in the lead. Among the oil-rig workers are ""Good Will Huntings"" Ben Affleck tomcat A.J. Frost and Steve Buscemi as a genius pervert called Rockhound.And watching the world-saving antics of this bunch are such appalled U.S. dignitaries as Keith Davids gruff Gen. Kimsey and Thorntons Truman as well as Stampers daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) trying to choose between her dads love and her lover A.J.s arms. And of course also watching via international TV is the whole panic-stricken world.This film takes the opposite approach from the better-written ""Deep Impact"" which tries (at least superficially) to examine the impending apocalypses human consequences. ""Armageddon"" the better visualized and directed (by Michael Bay) of the two ignores the rest of the world except for occasional shots of pre-impact teaser disasters -- in one virtuoso shot we see Paris destroyed Eiffel Tower and all from the viewpoint of a gargoyle perched on the Notre Dame cathedral -- and exotic snippets of the worlds masses following our zany heroes adventures in montages that suggest the old ""Id like to give the world a Coke"" TV ads.""Armageddons"" original script draft was by Jonathan Hensleigh an action-movie manufacturer whose uninspired but lucrative filmography includes ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" ""The Rock"" ""The Saint"" and ""Con Air."" But the final script has been spiffed up by a squad of talented script doctors who pump life variety and character into the story. And if they cant make the story any more sensible at least they keep it hopping. ""Armageddon"" is often ridiculous but never a bore.Willis does his standard blue-collar-hero number though at times he looks a little young for the part. And Affleck without the lines he had in either ""Chasing Amy"" or ""Good Will Hunting"" is a more conventional rowdy male ingenue. But Thornton who doesnt usually make movies like this is the movies emotional glue. Thorntons Truman is one of the few characters in the movie who acts as if the world might actually end -- which means that hes personally responsible for most of the films psychological tension.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesWhen Movies CollideMay 10 1998`Armageddon Blasts To Box-office Top SpotJuly 6 1998`Armageddon An Amusing ExperienceJuly 3 1998`Armageddons Special Effects Are Out Of This WorldJuly 16 1998Ben Is A HitJuly 7 1998Find More Stories AboutAsteroidArmageddonTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-01/features/9807010307_1_harry-s-stamper-armageddon-oil-rig-workers,200,armageddon7,armageddon,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Armageddons Charlton Heston-voiced opening narration an account of how an asteroid seems to have led to the extinction of the dinosaurs is an ominous touch in every sense of the phrase. The text of the speech sets the stage for the threat of mass destruction promised by the movies title while Hestons voice assures that the threat will be addressed in the most American way possible. And it is thanks to a photogenic ragtag bunch of misfits headed by Bruce Willis. Willis plays the worlds greatest oil driller recruited by NASA head Billy Bob Thornton to plant a nuclear bomb in the belly of an earthbound asteroid. Will Willis overcome his creepy attachment to his daughter (Liv Tyler) and reconcile with her oil-drilling lover (Ben Affleck) in time to save America and the rest of the world? What suspense there is in Armageddon naturally lies elsewhere. Will for instance director Michael Bay (The Rock) continue to find an excuse to place an American flag in every other shot? (This at one point includes a shot showing that the patriotic astronauts have gone to the trouble of planting one on the asteroid they intend to blow up.) Will Tyler be photographed in a way that doesnt make her look as if shes posing for a Revlon ad? Will this be the one film featuring a ragtag bunch of misfits in which the lovable fat guy makes it out alive? Fortunately the near-incomprehensibility of the numerous action scenes and the disposability of the rest of the movie allow plenty of time to contemplate such things. The entire second half seems to consist of nothing but vibrating close-ups of heads shouting lines like ""Im not leaving without my men"" and ""Were jumping over that canyon"" As with The Rock Bay directs Armageddon in a way that seems more concerned with constantly assaulting the senses than anything else hoping perhaps that the quick cuts and constant explosions will distract from his films many flaws. Unless youre extremely easily entertained they probably wont.

"Armageddon (PG-13) Related Item ""Armageddon"" showtimes The Asteroid Misses; So Does the Movie By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday July 1 1998 Bruce Willis trys to save Earth from ""Armageddon."" (Touchstone) Director Michael Bay Cast Bruce Willis; Ben Affleck; Billy Bob Thornton; Steve Buscemi; Liv Tyler; Will Patton Running Time 2 hours 40 minutes For emotional intensity a little gore a little swearing and lots of explosions ""Armageddon"" the movie certainly isnt drawn from the Book of Revelation like Armageddon the word (1616). Its drawn from a book of the revelationless (00). So predictable it could have been written by a chimp whos watched too much TV the huge movie is as dumb as it is loud and its way too loud. Watching it is like putting your head in a tin washbucket while weightlifters whack it with golf clubs. The second in this summers annoying-rock-from-outer-space films this one makes ""Deep Impact"" look like ""Les Enfants du Paradis."" But the worst thing is its shameless. Its craven sniveling self-degrading in its mercenary need to be a hit. It leaves no stone unturned in its search for the perfect cliche for the lowest common denominator. It leaves no chord of piety or patriotism unstrummed in its hunger to play a billion-dollar tune. Flags? Babies? Sacrifices? Heroism? Multiethnic brotherly love? Its the worst kind of twaddle loud twaddle. News flash Asteroid will strike Earth in 23 days. Hmmm nobodys been looking up intently enough to notice something the size of Texas approaching from a galaxy far far away? Well anyway our only hope Send a dirty dozen of oil drillers - a big bearish papa figure a muscle guy a surfer a fallen ironic intellectual a bad dad a rebellious kid a big fat guy and so on (wheres Telly Savalas when you need him?) - out to the asteroid. Have them drill 800 feet beneath its surface place a nuke in the shaft and blow the thing in two so that each half will miss the Earth. This is a movie only a dentist could love especially the part where they forget to give the asteroid Novocain. Maybe it hates needles. Bruce Willis plays the papa bear and as Harry S. Stamper the worlds greatest oil driller he stamps around yelling ""Whos been sleeping in my daughters bed?"" Willis is a little short in the tooth for this role which essentially requires the avuncular yet authoritative machismo of late ironic John Wayne (say from ""McLintock"" or ""Hatari"") so he always seems to be pretending to be a grown-up. He has one cool moment The movie discovers him hitting golf balls at Greenpeace demonstrators from his oil rig in some southern sea. Willis is okay in a part that calls for mostly grimacing and growling; Billy Bob Thornton an actual real actor as opposed to a movie star is pretty good as the head of NASA whose brainstorm it is to try Operation Messiah. Others are less fortunate Ben Affleck as the young reb whos in love with Harrys daughter (Liv Tyler pure ornamentation) Owen Wilson as the surfer dude driller the normally reliable Steve Buscemi as the intellectual and Ken Campbell as the fat one. But of the conspicuously colorful drillers only the perpetually brilliant Will Patton really registers as a runaway father consumed with guilt and willing to take this last giant risk as his one shot at redemption. These are all cliches writ big; everyone else in the cast is a cliche writ small down to what the press notes identify as ""Newscaster 4"" (its a newscaster-rich kind of movie). But the problem with the film isnt really in the acting; with a cast culled from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts or the Primate House at the National Zoo the results would be about the same. Its the entire thing thats been misconceived from the editing scheme (relentless as a drum set bouncing down a long steep marble stairway) to the scenic design to the special effects. Its all bunk. For example in order to personalize the impersonal and make the asteroid somehow evil - come on how can an insensate rock be evil? - some production designer has imagined it as a kind of planet of the razor blades. Its all craggy rock formations and spitting fissures but it looks cheesy and indoorsy like something off a cheap-jack 60s TV series say ""Lost in Space."" Despite all the computer morphing that sends the NASA shuttles zooming around the moon to link up with this craggy puckered spaceball you never really believe youre anywhere except on a back lot. Worse still is the action most of which turns on men doing baffling mechanical things in very bad weather amid explosions that are heavy on the flash and really blow the styrofoam to hell and gone. It would have helped if director Michael Bay and his fleet of screenwriters had thought it fit to include 30 or 40 seconds of info about drilling in the 21/2-hour film so that what we see would be at least comprehensible. No they were too busy plotting explosions; the result is that a lot of the time the men stand around and curse at something that looks like an electric shaver on a pole. Hello is this exciting or what? But none of the sequences really vary much. Its too monotonous The stentorian urgency of all the government figures to the oddball banter of those wacky drillers the flying debris the splosions squirting flaming propane up to the soundstage rafters the ticking doomsday clock as the numbers liquefy toward 0000 and everyone being plucky and heroic and patriotic. You get all this in the first few minutes and youre still getting it in the last few minutes. And the action hasnt been orchestrated to escalate. It doesnt climb through gears and pitches reaching a screaming point where you go into oxygen debt; it just whizzes tediously along like a car on an interstate dragging a chain. By the end in the last cheesy twist of cornball heroics - the tear running nobly down Williss cheek was a touch of kitsch so obnoxiously craven I could hardly stay there - I was rooting for the asteroid.

Fast-forward a few millennia and Stand-Up Paddleboarding or SUP finds itself trendy again. Part of its increasing popularity is that standing upright allows surfers to spot waves more easily and thus catch more of them multiplying the fun factor. Paddling back to the wave becomes less of a strain as well. The ability to cruise along on flat inland water surveying the sights is another advantage. Finally its a good core workout. If youre sold on the idea schedule an intro SUP lesson free with board and paddle rental and you may find yourself riding the waves like a Polynesian king.

Written by Jonathan Hensleigh and J.J. Abrams. Starring Bruce Willis Liv Tyler Ben Affleck Steve Buscemi and Billy Bob Thornton. Opens Wednesday July 1 at area theaters. Michael Bay is the director of Bad Boys and The Rock and the new asteroid-attack movie Armageddon -- which should be called The Very Big Rock. He has Im afraid perfected a new form His movies are trailers for themselves. Every scene is all climax and no foreplay. When its all over you cant remember if youve been watching a movie or just a jumbo-sized coming attraction. In Bays hands theyre the same thing. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer Armageddon is a particularly fragrant example of the state-of-the-(non)-art. With previous Bay films all produced by Bruckheimer and his late partner Don Simpson there at least came a moment -- usually about an hour into the film -- when things settled down a bit. That is to say we could actually observe two people calmly talking to each other for a couple of minutes without having the camera turn whirlybirds about them to the beat of an eardrum-warping rock score. But in Armageddon Bay has attained his noxious nirvana There isnt a scene in the film that exists on any level except as a hard sell. If this movie-as-trailer thing really catches on its the death of storytelling -- not to mention grace subtlety coherence character development beauty. Its Armageddon all right. The best you can say about Armageddon is that its better than Deep Impact -- this summers other meteor disaster movie. At least Bays film doesnt try to palm itself off as some kind of civics lesson. Deep Impact made the impending end of the world look like a bad traffic jam; we were supposed to take comfort in the filmmakers notion that in times of crisis human beings come together. (Gee even Titanic didnt fall for that one.) Armageddon is cheerfully anti-social which is its best -- and only -- virtue. But the trouble with all the kick-ass tomfoolery is that it undercuts the awe in the enterprise. If youre going to make a movie about the end of the planet it would be helpful to demonstrate even a smidgen of feeling for the world thats about to be destroyed. As in Deep Impact we are faced here with a giant Earth-bound asteroid that must be diverted by astronauts who venture out to the rock to implant nukes in its core. The nukers in this case are a roughneck team of oil drillers led by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis). Recruited by NASA and its executive director (Billy Bob Thornton) Stamper and his cohorts -- played by among others Will Patton Steve Buscemi Owen Wilson and Ben Affleck -- undergo a week of astronaut training before blasting off. Wisecracking all the way they treat the asteroid -- its the size of Texas -- like just another oil rig. Its The Dirty Dozen in space along with a healthy dollop of Simpson-Bruckheimers Top Gun. Bay with his screenwriters Jonathan Hensleigh and J.J. Abrams milks the comparisons. A note on the screenwriters. The studio production kit offers up this hosanna. ""In creating one of the most exciting action-adventure scripts in Hollywood history Bruckheimer the master of the genre assembled a cadre of talented writers including Shane Salerno Tony Gilroy J.J. Abrams Paul Attanasio Ann Biderman Scott Rosenberg and Academy Award-winner Robert Towne who worked 16-hour days seven days a week over an intensive eight-week period writing polishing and perfecting the material."" In other words the old Hollywood studio system of assembly-line hackwork is back with a vengeance. I trust everybody was well-paid for all that ""polishing and perfecting."" The film could have used a bit more perfection. Characters are introduced with a flourish in the beginning -- a geezer astronomer or a NASA egghead -- only to drop unceremoniously from sight. Every so often Bay serves up a destructo scene -- asteroid chunks hitting New York or Paris -- just in case anybody in the audience was about to slip into a coma. Billy Bob Thornton looking here unaccountably like King Hussein minus the headgear gets to spout such ""polished"" dialogue as that old military-ese chestnut ""Recheck everything and then check it again."" Willis at least has one good line Looking at NASAs poor excuse for an asteroid drill he smirks ""Your cams are all wrong."" The way he says it you know hes talking about a lot more than cams. Actually Willis isnt bad -- but then again hes often good in the movies. He gives his jock nonchalance some emotional levels. But in Armageddon not only does his Harry Stamper have to save the world -- he also has to contend with his headstrong daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) who is lovingly photographed as if she were the star of a margarine commercial. Grace and the roughneck A.J. (Affleck) are gaga for each other but of course her father wants her to marry a proper gentleman instead. Secretly though Harry loves A.J. like a son. At least thats what were supposed to think. Theres an unintentionally creepy moment when Harry spies Grace and A.J. doing some heavy petting and he looks on them a bit too lingeringly. Eeeuuu gross. I could go on but that would mean reliving more of this movie and -- well -- lifes too short. But mention should be made of the fact that both Deep Impact and Armageddon make a big to-do about how this asteroid-collision stuff is all too real. Bummer. Yes its probably true that asteroids wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. But I wonder what all those dinos would think now if they saw Armageddon. Mightnt they say ""You mean we died for this?"" Maybe it is time for another asteroid hit. I can recommend a few targets in Hollywood. Tags Film Michael Bay Bruce Willis J.J.

Theres Rockhound the iconoclast and compulsive womanizer with the heart of gold. Theres A.J. the brasher-than-thou young man with the heart of gold. And theres Harry their fearless leader the coarse roughneck with _ you guessed it _ the heart of gold. Theyre all roll-up-your-sleeves get-down-and-dirty oil drillers drilling away their lives on a rig somewhere in the Pacific. That is until destiny calls. Then they step forward unified to save civilization as we know it ... from an asteroid the size of Texas. Thus the premise of the frantic and portentous ``Armageddon which isnt so much an apocalyptic sci-fi epic as it is a buddy flick Call it ``The B-Team _ Stephen J. Cannell meets Irwin Allen meets Isaac Asimov. Its not wonderful. But its a lot better than it could be _ crisp fast-paced visual without being effects-obsessed and saved from summer-blockbuster mediocrity in large part by the manic ministrations of the always twisted Steve Buscemi. The first question you might be asking is understandable Is Summer Asteroid Movie No. 2 (``Armageddon) any different than Summer Asteroid Movie No. 1 (``Deep Impact)? The answer is a resounding yes. And each of them is worthy in its own way. While ``Impact had the threaded-storyline feel of an apocalyptic ``All My Children ``Armageddon is tightly focused on the er drill team charged with going up on a souped-up space shuttle landing on the speeding asteroid drilling 800 feet down and dropping a nuclear bomb in the hole. If all goes well asteroid explodes and splits hurtling away harmlessly and Earth is saved for another Hollywood disaster movie. Bruce Willis his performance approaching acting more than usual for the genre plays Harry Stamper the leader of the bakers dozen or so of old friends. Stamper is a prematurely craggy former Marine whos good at what he does and knows it. He trusts only himself which is his characters major _ and apparently only _ internal conflict. His daughter Grace (the endlessly fascinating Liv Tyler her fathers gratuitous appearance on the movie soundtrack notwithstanding) who grew up on oil rigs around the world is in love with A.J. (Ben Affleck) a younger angrier version of Harry whos constantly clashing with the older man. The young lovers want to get married but the asteroid and the mission come between them. Buscemi plays Rockhound doing what Buscemi did so well in ``Fargo and ``Reservoir Dogs _ whatever exactly that is; hes one weird dude. And a restrained Billy Bob Thornton rises above the material to portray the head of NASA as a quiet hero determined to overcome the bureaucracy. Rounding out the cast are solid performances from Peter Stormare (``Fargo) as a disheveled cosmonaut who finds himself caught up in the mission; Will Patton as the long-irresponsible Chick determined to show his young son hes a hero; William Fichtner as the nails-tough REAL astronaut on the mission; and most delightfully Michael Clarke Duncan as Bear a gigantic man who with Buscemi is handed some of the best lines of the movie. As utterly charming as Liv Tyler is and as affable as Affleck is their romance just doesnt work. The scenes between them are the most excruciating of the film _ except for some of the corny lines that burst forth from the Willis maw ( ``The United States government just asked us to save the world _ anybody want to say no?). Still this is a laugh-out-loud-and-go-along-for-the-ride movie a picture-show type of experience. Its schlock sure but its fun schlock with good performances and good special effects and a reasonably brisk script. It pushes all the right buttons in two formulas _ action-comedy and adventure. Its a lot more for your eight bucks than ``Godzilla ever could be _ and does a much better job of destroying the Chrysler Building to boot. ``Armageddon is directed by Michael Bay and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer Gale Anne Hurd and Bay from a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and J.J.

The second and mercifully last of the seasons nuke-the-asteroid-or-bust pre-millennium spectaculars is so effects-obsessed and dramatically be-numbed as to make ""Deep Impact"" look like a humanistic masterpiece. Bruce Willis saves the world but cant save ""Armageddon."" The second and mercifully last of the seasons nuke-the-asteroid-or-bust pre-millennium spectaculars is so effects-obsessed and dramatically be-numbed as to make ""Deep Impact"" look like a humanistic masterpiece. Despite its frequently incoherent staging and an editing style that amounts to a two and a half-hour sensory pummeling 150 million sci-fi actioner nonetheless has the Willis juice Jerry Bruckheimer-Michael Bay bad-boy ingredients and Disney marketing muscle going for it to launch it into high commercial orbit. Only question mark relates to the unexpected endurance ""Deep Impact"" has demonstrated and whether the Paramount hit the biggest 1998 release thus far will indeed have a ""Dantes Peak""/""Volcano"" dampening effect on want-see for this more elaborate and expensive but even sillier and less engaging production. In theory a drama about the imminent end of the world if an asteroid hurtling toward Earth cant be blown off course by some courageous astronauts pic plays more like ""Con Air Goes to Outer Space."" Making most of the decisions made by the ""Deep Impact"" team look good in retrospect filmmakers here take delight in assembling a team of ex-cons wise-asses musclemen and jokers as the group that will try to save the world but by their own example raise serious doubts as to whether humanity is worth saving. It took five credited writers and four more named in the press materials to concoct this high-concept but otherwise staggeringly unimaginative tale which parallels ""Deep Impact"" quite closely in its basic trajectory if not in its details tone and selection of characters. Earlier release while hokey and directed like a careening train at least took a thoughtful approach to the idea of impending global mortality; in ""Armageddon"" doomsday is approached like a giant videogame. Picking on a New York City only recently demolished cinematically by Godzilla (one of ""Armageddons"" few decent chuckles stems from a fierce little Manhattan dog attacking a plastic toy Godzilla) film begins with fireballs raining down on Gotham disemboweling Grand Central Station decapitating the Chrysler Building and generally wrecking the town. Amazingly however despite the fact that an asteroid the size of Texas is heading straight for the planet the U.S. administration figures it can keep a lid on the news at least until it figures out what to do about it. Determining as in ""Deep Impact"" that the only thing to do is to implant a nuke or two in the giant hunk of rock to split it apart before it creates a big bang that will assuredly do to humanity what a similar collision once did to the dinosaurs NASA repped by exec director Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) recruits the worlds top oil driller Harry S. Stamper (Willis) for the job. A maverick but responsive to the greater international need Stamper agrees on condition that he can select his own team and its here that the picture becomes irretrievably ludicrous The ""Dirty 14"" which will fly up on two space shuttles consists mostly of miscreants with bad attitudes and Stamper compounds the insult to professionalism and integrity with the request that should the group survive the mission they all be rewarded by not having to pay income taxes ever again. Exposition training and buildup to blastoff occupy films first half which also concerns itself with an inane subplot of borderline puppy love between Stampers daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) and his top-gun crew hand A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck) a relationship of which Dad for some reason disapproves. The more prominent of the other thesps are given one trait to define their characters Will Patton has been a bad father but hopes to redeem himself Ken Campbell is a big man with big fear and Steve Buscemi likes busty hookers. None of them has any more depth than a character in a 30-second TV commercial. After a preposterous little ""intermission"" in which the crew is liberated for some pre-launch raunch pic be-comes an outer-space saga in which the shuttles dock with a Russian space station to refuel slingshot around the moon endure debris from the asteroid and finally land to lay a nuke deep inside the inhospitable black rock. Scripters (who in addition to those credited included Paul Attanasio Ann Biderman Scott Rosenberg and Robert Towne per press notes) come up with plenty of obstacles for the intrepid drillers to overcome but director Bays visual presentation is so frantic and chaotic that one often cant tell which ship or characters are being shown or where things are in relation to one another. Much of the confusion as well as the lack of dramatic rhythm or character development results directly from Bays cutting style which resembles a machine gun stuck in the firing position for 2 and a half hours. Perhaps someone will someday reveal how many separate shots make up ""Armageddon"" but the count has to be one of the highest in Hollywood history; at a guess there must be a cut every three seconds or so. In order to enhance the films destructive possibilities the mini-asteroids that serve as a taste of things to come are given unusually good aim hitting only major cities -- New York Shanghai and in a gratuitous late-in-the-game hit Paris. In a lame attempt to globalize the drama insert shots show thousands of natives praying in front of the Blue Mosque in Istanbul and the Taj Mahal (not a religious site) in India which somehow only increases the jingoistic thank-you-America-for-saving-the-world message. Films performance style consists of yelling above the ambient noise which is usually considerable. Special effects are incessant and sometimes pretty groovy but given the length of time each shot is on the screen theyre usually here one second gone the next. All tech credits are predictably gigantic.

Abrams story by Robert Roy Pool and Mr. Hensleigh and adaptation by Tony Gilory and Shane Salerno is far from being the worst movie of the year but it certainly works hard enough to be the most aggravating. In all the highly publicized marketing strategy associated with this would-be box-office ""event"" no one at the Disney organization from producer Jerry Bruckheimer on down seemed to worry that Francophiles like me would be offended by the casual obliteration of Paris by a stray meteorite seemingly added to the mayhem fairly early on to keep the kiddie video game players in the audience awake during the frenetically tedious pre-disaster or rather near-miss proceedings. Environmentalists are also given short shrift in a nasty introduction to the films ultimate hero oceanic oil driller Harry S. Stamper (Bruce Willis) who is seen hitting golf balls off his oil platform at an offending Greenpeace vessel. What wimps The line between the character and the actor are somewhat blurred by the publicly espoused conservative stands of Mr. Willis. Oddly I cant help feeling a sneaky fondness and respect for him as the moral and emotional center of the most preposterous action melodramas of which Armageddon is undeniably in a class by itself. I had heard so much in advance about how silly Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck were as the love interest that I didnt mind them half as much as I thought I should. Also better than the cinematic shambles of Armageddon deserve are Billy Bob Thornton as the coolheaded NASA chief honcho Dan Truman Will Patton as Charles (Chick) Chapple a poignantly failed husband and father seeking redemption in a dangerous mission and Steve Buscemi as comically womanizing Rockhound who we are told with a straight face eventually is stricken with space mania. By now you probably know whether or not you should sell all your Disney stock. The domestic grosses for Godzilla and Deep Impact wont hack it for this 140 million compendium of all the unforgettable moments from every buddy-buddy and big-bang flick youve ever seen or heard about. I was particularly struck by the one about the guy about to go on a suicide mission who gets knocked out by another nobler guy who wants to die instead and thus have the audience love him even after the final fade-out. I thought that one big obstacle to Armageddon on its projected passage to the box-office stratosphere (52.9 million in its first five days) would have been the fact that most people dont like Bruce Willis as much as I do especially after he has announced his separation from Demi Moore whom I also like more than most people do. Its not that the audience is tired of the genre itself. What Independence Day had and Armageddon doesnt is a monstrous enemy destroyed by sheer cocksure attitude. What Titanic had and Armageddon doesnt is a real-life catastrophe the details of which have mesmerized people for more than 80 years. For all of Michael Bays MTV direction with its often mindlessly frenzied editing for all of the jingoistic invocations of God and Country for all of the stereotypical views of other races and other cultures for all of the vulgarities spewed on the soundtrack to incite idiot laughter between explosions Armageddon is much too nice and noble for the targeted bloodthirsty rabble. I must confess that at times I found myself rooting for the meteor to hit the Earth and put us all out of our misery. The outer space special effects are boringly excruciating and it is impossible to believe that anyone could survive all that roaring noise and speeding debris without at the very least having a nervous breakdown. It is not so much the waste of money represented by Armageddon that depresses me as it is the absolute certainty that no one with money and power in the film industry will learn any lessons even if Armageddon joins Godzilla on the scrapheap. There will be the usual roundup of suspects or scapegoats. A few producers will complain that Julia Roberts Sandra Bullock Alicia Silverstone and Demi Moore have not panned out in their high-priced production deals and the only answer is to give Leonardo DiCaprio 20 million or 30 million for his next picture. Meanwhile the monsters of Jurassic Park are being warmed up for the next millennium. By then we may look back on the soggier sentiments of Armageddon with a certain fondness. I must confess that I left the theater with a better taste in my mouth after Armageddon than I had after the sordid and mean-spirited goings-on in A Perfect Murder . Carlas Song Drowns in Its Message Ken Loachs Carlas Song  from a screenplay by Paul Laverty is lesser Loach but for all its lapses and lethargies it is still more poetic and penetrating in its humanist realism than most movies on the current scene. The fact remains that Mr. Loach crosses over the line to hard-core agitprop advocacy with a dramatically undigested diatribe against the C.I.A. which heaven knows can be blamed for many of the worlds ills particularly in Central America the setting also of John Sayles more allegorical Men With Guns . I first noted Mr. Loachs lyrical talent in the service of lifes losers in Poor Cow (1968) with a memorable performance by Carol White as a promiscuous working-class housewife in love with her thieving husbands best friend played by Terrance Stamp and Kes (1969) a fable of lower-class falconry as a metaphor for a working-class boys yearning for a less dismal environment. Mr. Loach worked extensively on British television through the 70s and 80s with the occasional feature film assignment most notably the adventure yarn Black Jack (1979). He burst upon the world scene with three powerful working-class domestic narratives Riff Raff (1991) Raining Stones (1993) and Ladybird Ladybird (1994). The implicit political assumptions of these three reawakenings of social consciousness in Margaret Thatchers brutalized Britain was made explicit in his eloquent Spanish Civil War picture Land and Freedom (1995) from a script by Jim Allen. If Carlas Song is less successful than the now-62-year-old Mr. Loachs previous film forays to the left of the complacent center it is not without its own privileged moments and poetic metaphors. The film begins on a double-decker bus driven by George (Robert Carlyle) in 1987 Glasgow. Coming to the aid of a young fare-beating Nicaraguan refugee named Carla (Oyanka Cabezas) George becomes deeply involved with her both as a woman and as a cause once he sees the signs of torture on her back. After a few local scenes in Glasgow which visitors have told me is the most purely proletarian city in the British Isles George hijacks his own bus to take Carla on a scenic trip to nearby Loch Lomond. But there the picturesque ends and the polemical begins with a mysteriously motivated trip by George and Carla to her native Nicaragua where she begins a dangerous search for her missing lover Antonio (Richard Loza). George and Carla are assisted in their quest by Bradley (Scott Glenn) a disaffected former C.I.A. agent who eventually reveals the depredations of the evil forces in the service of American corporations. Mr. Loach and his screenwriter Mr. Laverty have researched the subject thoroughly and we respond at some level to the litany of Sandinistas and contras so familiar to American ears after the televised Iran-contra hearings during the Reagan Administration. As impressive as Mr. Loachs rendering of real-life contemporary Nicaragua as a stand-in of sorts for the more turbulent Nicaragua of a decade earlier one must suspect that a great deal of irony and complexity has been sacrificed for the sake of dispensing propaganda. In the process the characters are swallowed up by the ""message."" The fact that Carla is played by a non-actress however charming is another handicap for a movie more documented than dramatized. Rewind Two Comedies Not to Be Missed Des McAnuffs Cousin Bette  from the screenplay by Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr based on the novel by Honore de Balzac and Ivan Reitmans Six Days Seven Nights  from the screenplay by Michael Browning are two rollicking entertainments that have been glibly and grossly underrated during their brief runs. The raps against Cousin Bette have been that the movie is not faithful to the book and that Jessica Lange is not ugly enough to play Bette. A completely faithful adaptation of Balzacs cavalcade of Parisian follies would require at least an eight-hour mini-series and ""ugly"" on the printed page is invariably translated as ""plain"" on the silver screen. Ms. Lange is plain enough and shrewdly vengeful enough to make a more than adequate Bette and she is splendidly supported by saucy Elisabeth Shue as the flighty but shrewdly realistic courtesan and mediocre performer with a delectably bared derriere as her compensating attraction. Hugh Laurie as the born-to-be-bankrupted aristocrat Hector Bob Hoskins as the mercenary and lecherous Crevel and Aden Young as the lazy Polish sculptor Wenceslas who becomes the hapless pawn of three women in turn form a trio of male moths hovering around the money-fueled flame of female beauty. The period proceedings are directed fluidly without ever becoming stodgy or overstuffed. Fun and feeling are very delicately balanced in this most promising screen directorial debut of theater director Des McAnuff. As for Six Days Seven Nights  Harrison Ford and Anne Heche make up the brightest and sharpest screwball comedy team I have seen in ages. Their expertly timed line readings are alone worth the price of admission.

Talk about the wrong stuff gripes a disgusted NASA official checking out the roughnecks selected to save the world Afflecks cocky AJ Davids mighty General and Buscemis scene-stealing sociopath Rockhound men whose most heartfelt request is that they be granted tax exemption for the rest of their lives. Producer Bruckheimer (Con Air Crimson Tide) has this brand of testosterone entertainment down pat. Crucial elements include a sterling supporting cast (Stormare as a reckless Russian cosmonaut Thornton as Houstons pointman Patton and Fichtner riding shotgun) biting down on lines beefed up by the likes of Scott Rosenberg and Robert Towne. Its just as well its all so tongue-in-cheek because the one thing Bay cant sell is sincerity lovey-dovey scenes involving Tyler and the supine populations of the world are excruciatingly hokey.

"The Big Bang - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW The Big BangArmageddon threatens the world and only an unlikely bunch of guys can save the planet in a long noisy and sporadically watchable film.July 01 1998|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC You know youre not in the intended demographic group for ""Armageddon"" the loud new film about how a Bruce Willis-led team of roughnecks tries to save the world from a deadly asteroid if you even notice its loud; you dont consider two hours and 30 minutes an ideal length for this kind of thing; you find yourself missing the barely there sensitivity of ""Deep Impact""; you think of roughneck Steve Buscemi as a mainstay of American independent films not one of the co-stars of ""Con Air""; you have your doubts about lines like ""Lets chew this iron bitch up""; you notice a shot lifted from a Robert Frank photograph and wonder what its doing there and if hes going to get residuals; you recognize plot elements so venerable that they can be categorized by name like ""the blue wire or red wire dilemma"" and ""the damn kid knocked me out and flew the plane himself""; you actually care that director Michael Bays filmmaking style is so frantic and frenetic that its often impossible to figure out exactly what is happening; you decide that rooting for the asteroid is a viable option.Big and clumsy the way only 140-million projects manage to be ""Armageddon"" is finally undone by its grandiosity as much as by anything else. Sporadically watchable its at its best at those infrequent moments when it doesnt take itself too seriously. But the films general tendency to overplay its strengths and emphasize its weaknesses is a tough obstacle to overcome.One of those squandered strengths is Bay. He is a celebrated commercial director whose previous features (""Bad Boys"" ""The Rock"") demonstrate as this film does a sharp slick look (here achieved by cinematographer John Schwartzman) linked to an ability to move things along.""Armageddons"" story is set up by a prologue (read by Charlton Heston) that relates the widely believed theory that the last time a large object from outer space hit the Earth it eliminated the dinosaurs. ""It happened before"" Heston intones as only Heston can; ""it will happen again. Its just a question of when.""The first warning that that time is now comes when high-speed debris destroys a space shuttle and plows into Manhattan creating a wave of flying taxis and exploding buses and causing the top of the Chrysler Building to flip point-first onto the street like an oversized dart.Its only going to get worse warns Dan Truman the executive director of NASA (Billy Bob Thornton expertly handling the take-charge Texan role usually reserved for Tommy Lee Jones). An asteroid the size of that great state will hit Earth in 18 days and function as ""a global killer. Half the world will be incinerated by the heat blast; the rest will freeze to death in a nuclear winter. Basically its the worst parts of the Bible.""The only way to stop this cataclysm the government somehow decides is to rocket a team of drillers onto the asteroid have them dig an 800-foot hole plant an atomic bomb and then get the hell out of Dodge before the thing goes off. If you think a lot can go wrong within that scenario youve been peeking at the script.The worlds best deep-core driller just happens to be oil wildcatter Harry S. Stamper (Willis). No touchy-feely tree-hugger Stamper divides his time between hitting golf balls at anti-drilling Greenpeace activists and trying to kill A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck) the top man on his crew who happens to have fallen in love with Stampers daughter Grace (Liv Tyler).Naturally Stamper wont take on the job without his Dirty Dozen-like seven-man gang a group of well-cast wacky eccentrics that includes Will Patton Buscemi and ""Bottle Rockets"" Owen Wilson. Military types arent happy ""leaving the fate of the planet in the hands of a bunch of retards you wouldnt trust with a potato gun"" but thats Hollywood for you.Speaking of Hollywood what is hard to figure out is why ""Armageddon"" needed so many writers. Five of them got screen credit arrayed in a configuration so complex (story by Jonathan Hensleigh and Robert Pool adaptation by Tony Gilroy and Shane Salerno screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and J.J. Abrams) you practically need a directive from the Writers Guild to understand exactly who did what.Also and this may be a first the films press kit boasts about and even lists by name some of the high-profile uncredited writers (Paul Attanasio Ann Biderman Scott Rosenberg Robert Towne) who worked on the script. All this talent has led to some amusing moments but overall their use only underlines the manufactured nature of filmmaking on this scale.Despite this horde of writers the emotional side of ""Armageddon"" remains stubbornly and conspicuously weak and its an area the filmmakers have regrettably fallen in love with. Considerable screen time is devoted to the sensitive romance between A.J. and Grace but their moments together can most charitably be called unconvincing.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTransformers director Michael Bay as audience darlingJune 29 2009Fast action heroJuly 1 2007Living for the chaseJuly 22 2005Merrill to Reimburse Film Director 300000December 13 2002Marshaling All of His ForcesMay 18 2001Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/01/entertainment/ca-65420,200,armageddon18,armageddon,latimes

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 2 1998 330 AM The End of the World as We Know It? No problem. Bruce Willis has his sneer handy. By David Edelstein ArmageddonDirected by Michael Bay Buena Vista Pictures Out of SightDirected by Steven Soderbergh Universal Pictures It cannot be said too often that the principal job of a modern mainstream movie critic is to distinguish smart formula crap from dumb formula crap. At one extreme are The Truman Show and Men in Black at the other Godzilla and the dire Six Days Seven Nights which squanders a plucky Carole Lombardish turn by the scrumptious Anne Heche. Theres an especially virulent subdivision of the above smart formula crap that makes the viewer dumb. To this category can be assigned the new Armageddon a blow-you-out-of-your-seat blockbuster thats sure to make you laugh cry thump your chest like an ape and call your broker to buy shares of Disney stock. Count on lethal asteroids to replace UFOs in the Zeitgeist Watch; actor Steve Buscemis asking price to triple; and producer Jerry Bruckheimer to end up back where he was in the era of Top Gun (1986) before his dead partner Don Simpson blew the duos credibility on cocaine cars and call girls. How dumb did Armageddon render this reviewer? So dumb that hes giving it a good review. Advertisement With reservations of course. Simpson-Bruckheimer movies (the spirit of Simpson hangs over Bruckheimer products like a chemical spill) push every button pushable including some you never knew you had. The aim is to get you pumped bellowing pogoing backward up the aisle playing air guitar. Armageddon is one killer climax after another. Will New York City survive the shower of meteors that launches the picture (spectacularly)? Will deep-core driller Bruce Willis murder smarmy sidekick Ben Affleck when he discovers the lout in bed with his dishy daughter (Liv Tyler)? Will Willis accept the job proffered by Billy Bob Thornton to rocket to the incoming asteroid (the size of Texas) drill 800 feet beneath its crust drop an A-bomb and get the hell out of there? Will his team make it off the ramshackle Mir space station in one piece? Will both shuttles manage to land on the asteroid through a shower of (3-D surround-sound) debris? Will their drills penetrate the iron surface? Will they stop the Army from detonating the nuke before they reach 800 feet? In the tradition of screenplay guru Robert McKee the stakes in every act are ratcheted up. Where theres a cliff theres a hanger. Well Armageddon worked for this lab rat. The electrodes were cannily placed the jolts administered at regular intervals. Along with the rest of the audience I jumped when I was meant to jump laughed when I was meant to laugh and swallowed a lump in my throat when I was meant to feel moved. Its true little irritants kept creeping in. It gets harder and harder to like Affleck especially when he plays dumb guys by putting every line in the same generic working-Joe italics. Liv Tyler is a lollipop for the eyes but doesnt speak dress or move like someone raised on a deep-sea oil derrick. (Of course after getting away with Kelly McGillis flight instructor in Top Gun and the 22-year-old Nicole Kidmans brain surgeon in Days of Thunder Bruckheimer can probably be forgiven a certain cockiness.) The post-coital Affleck dancing an animal cracker on Tylers bare middle recalls Tom Cruise dancing a SweetN Low packet on Kidmans bare thigh See the naked starlet buy the product. A few trident missiles in this leftys side knee-jerk invocations of God and Flag; jabs at Greenpeace; Charlton Heston delivering the clenched-teeth opening narration; Willis climactic exhortation to ""Chew this iron bitch up"" Still there are few villains as apolitical as a giant asteroid. We can all agree that it would indeed be a good thing to chew that iron bitch up. Director Michael Bay (The Rock) has whiplash comic timing and he can certainly do spectacle The opening bombardment of Manhattan is riotously well edited and so is ... well without giving too much away we wont always have Paris. Its too bad that Bay has to hard-sell every shot. His pacing is strictly for the Ritalin generation and his car-commercial compositions make the movie seem even more synthetic. The asteroid itself is disappointingly undercharacterized and Bay compensates by turning every frame into a blur of motion. You cant really see what the drillers are doing--not even maverick Affleck in his big ""I can drill this"" number. Armageddon is awesome dude but its like short on awe. S till I cant dislike a picture in which when all seems lost the hero turns to the Mission Control camera and says ""Prepare the world for bad news."" Willis has become a master of doing nothing of finding just the right (and most noncommittal) combination of facetiousness and sincerity. He can deliver zingers and he can also invoke the Almighty. He can call himself a ""third-generation driller"" add that ""drilling is not a science its an art"" and not be laughed off the screen. Hes the perfect mascot for a have-it-both-ways hip/square disaster epic which parodies The Right Stuff machismo and wants you to buy into it at the same time (which is true come to think of it of The Right Stuff itself). The yucks come thick and fast until the motley comic-relief crew starts getting blown away in the line of duty and then its time to get patriotic. Advertisement In the end its Buscemis movie. As the horniest most sardonic member of Willis team he has the funniest lines and his wormy dyspeptic grin sits on the worlds most ingratiating skull head. Buscemi knows how to act on the fly which is essential in a Michael Bay picture if you want to be more than a splotch on the screen. As streakers go he makes more of an impact than the asteroid. Out of Sight is slick in all the right ways. It starts with a disorienting series of shock cuts during which George Clooney tears off his tie marches through traffic into a bank and without a weapon or a plan pulls off a charmingly effortless robbery foiled only by a bad starter on his wreck of a car. By now (only 10 minutes into the picture) the director Steven Soderbergh (sex lies andvideotape) has the audience in a happy receptive state--not quite knowing what to expect and delighted to find itself in such clever hands. The later whimsical novels of Elmore Leonard have been all too put-downable but Soderbergh contrives the perfect voice for Leonards prose--laid-back and grooving when it needs to be but also taut with the eerie foreboding of violence about to erupt. He has evolved into a first-rate commercial director. The movies zigs and zags are too entertaining to divulge but its permissible to say that Clooney and Jennifer Lopez as a Miami-based government marshal meet cute She gets shut up with him in the trunk of a getaway car and is hostage to his chatter about movies a life of crime and how he wishes he had met her in a bar so he could have picked her up. Clooney is a handsome rogue and knows it. Hes starting to go to seed though which makes him vulnerable--especially to Lopez a smart ripely beautiful actress who projects a disarmingly high opinion of herself. No phony demureness here She acts as if she came of age telling an endless parade of Latin men where to put it. When she succumbs to Clooneys Irish allure you know theres going to be a ""but."" Produced by the same team that made Leonards Get Shorty Out of Sight is stuffed with amazing actors among them Ving Rhames as Clooneys buddy Don Cheadle as a mercurial psychopath and in unbilled cameos Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson Jr. Best of all is Albert Brooks as a multimillionaire financier who meets up with Clooney when hes thrown in prison for felony fraud. Brooks studs his familiar sad-sack persona with hard shards of ruthlessness and opportunism. Like this terrific confection he never melts. David Edelstein is Slates film critic.

Starring Bruce Willis Ben Affleck Liv Tyler Steve Buscemi and Billy Bob Thornton. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Directed by Michael Bay. (PG-13. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The big rock that ""Armageddon"" was supposed to throw at us has just landed with a pitiful plop. It sure makes an ugly mess. But hey its only a movie. Its not the end of the world. Weve already seen ""Armageddon"" once this summer only it was called ""Deep Impact."" Same story different style. Unexpectedly with the opening today of the Bruce Willis ""Armageddon"" the earlier blockbuster though no great shakes turns out to be the more effective one. They should have called it ""Deeper Impact."" In both humankind is threatened by an asteroid (or comet) on a collision course with Earth and the team sent into space to blow it up is apparently doomed. Anyone who missed the destruction of the world the first time around is going to be disappointed this time too. Those shots of the plunging Chrysler Building in the TV commercials and movie trailers turn out to be a bait and switch. It is not Armageddon at all as we were led to believe but merely a meteor shower in advance of doomsday that causes the New York mayhem. It occurs early in what turns out to be a long and laborious slog. This is more steamroller than blockbuster. Six automobiles -- count em -- come flying out of New York traffic in bursts of flames. In this movie if you missed it the first time youll love it the next five times. Dont do anything that cant be overdone. Willis plays the Robert Duvall role of older team leader and its a crying shame what happens to him. In the course of this film Willis becomes heavy-spirited and reverential. Audiences love Willis for his sly humor nonchalance and subversiveness; we do not care to see him full of himself noble and mawkish. In ""Armageddon"" Bruce Willis cries. It is emotional blackmail and we do not feel for him. In fact we dont know what to feel. The ground keeps shifting under our feet as director Michael Bay (""The Rock"") runs through a number of styles. The thank-God- for-NASA ending is a full 180-degree reversal of the tone at the beginning which is action farce. Along the way among other things there are nods to ""The Seven Samurai."" Imagine that Jerry Bruckheimer is now comparing himself to Akira Kurosawa This Bruckheimer production follows his much more enjoyable ""The Rock"" and ""Con -- Air"" both with Nicolas Cage and by now the roguish badass formula has run out of energy. Willis as Stamper the macho honcho of a deep-sea oil rig is recruited to lead the NASA expedition to drill into and blow up the asteroid. He insists that some of his roughnecks come along and they are introduced ""Seven Samurai""- style. Then they stride side-by-side in heroic slow motion to the space shuttle. Kurosawa rip-off or homage? You decide. CHEAP LAUGHS Anyway are these Kurosawas samurai or John Belushis? The action-farce tone of the early going is particularly ugly. Ordinary people for no reason except a cheap laugh are presented as buffoons. The amateur astronomer who discovers the asteroid heading toward Earth says ""I want to name her Dixie after my wife -- shes a vicious life-sucking b--."" These are representatives of the humanity Willis is supposed to save? Kurosawas samurai only had to save a village but we saw them in action and never had any doubt they were fully capable of doing the job. These clowns have to save the entire planet. The big exception and best thing in the movie is Steve Buscemi who knows the drill from ""Con Air"" as the desperate joker Rockhound. I also got a kick out of the cowboys demands before they take on the mission (""Mac would like you to bring back eight-track tapes""). In the stupefying space-hardware sequences -- oops pardon me the space-action sequences -- there are barrages of fast cuts to distract us from the fact that the director is showing us no real action. The computer-graphics space travel is like staring at a video game. There is one truly awesome shot a digital image of Paris seen past a gargoyle on Notre Dame. Seven-fifty is pretty steep for one awesome shot. Its too bad the entire film didnt remain aboard the oil rig. Once they land on the asteroid Willis is stuck shouting orders inside the bubble of his space helmet. AFFLECK GETS CUTE Ben Affleck is cast as the male ingenue who is supposed to deliver diffident humor (""We all get to die right?""). Its sad to see a talented actor asked to play cute. In his scenes with Liv Tyler Stampers daughter Affleck gets to run animal crackers over her belly and later sings ""Leavin on a Jet Plane"" to her as the space shuttle is about to take off.

"Armageddon | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; armageddon ) Armageddon (United States 1998) A movie review by James Berardinelli Deep Impact has been buried. Godzillas size didnt matter as much as TriStar hoped it would. Six Days Seven Nights took about that long to come and go. Now its time for Bruce Willis to kick asteroid. Recalling the amazing box-office assault of 1996s Independence Day which was also released over the July 4 weekend Touchstone Pictures is understandably optimistic about the performance of their big summer gun the latest from Midas producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Crimson Tide Con Air). And why not? Since almost everything else released this season withered up in the June heat the field is clear. Armageddon is a testosterone and adrenaline cocktail with almost no intelligence added for flavoring. Its the latest in a line of increasingly-stupid action pictures that amazes audiences with flashy special effects and nifty action sequences but leaves them high and dry in both the character and story departments. Armageddon is like a video game crossed with an amusement park thrill ride and to a certain extent it can be enjoyed on those terms. Its certainly better than Godzilla not because its any less preposterous but because it is occasionally exciting -- a quality that could not be ascribed to any moment of the big lizards tedious romp through New York. Speaking of the Big Apple it is destroyed yet again. This time its not the only city to be blasted off the face of the Earth -- Paris gets the same treatment. Neither instance of urban renewal is necessary to the storyline but because Armageddon is a disaster movie there has be some sort of tangible big-scale disaster and leveling a few cities qualifies. After all the other space-object-headed-for-the-planet movie Deep Impact eradicated New York. Could Armageddon do any less? Actually after all the problems the city has experienced on the big screen this summer with incoming tidal waves exploding space debris and nasty monsters on the prowl it wouldnt surprise me if the tourist business was down. The meteor shower that punches a hole in the World Trade Center and rips apart the Empire State Building is only a precursor to the approach of a ""global killer"" asteroid (""nothing will survive not even bacteria"") -- a piece of space debris the size of Texas that when discovered it only 18 days away. Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) a NASA chief is given the task of finding a way to save the planet. His solution send a bunch of oil drillers into space in two shuttles and have them land on the asteroid. Once there they can drill 800 feet beneath the surface dump a nuclear warhead down the shaft then evacuate before the blast fragments the big rock sending the pieces flying off harmlessly into space. The man chosen to lead the expedition is the worlds best driller Harry Stamper (Willis). He has his team with him (they all look significantly different so we can tell them apart) the young hotshot A. J. (rising star Ben Affleck); the gambling addict Chick (Will Patton); the sex-obsessed weirdo Rockhound (Steve Buscemi); the baritone Bear (Michael Duncan); the big-as-a-mountain Max (Ken Hudson Campbell); and a few others not worth mentioning because they die quickly. Also along for the ride are a couple of NASA pilots (played by William Fichtner and Jessica Steen) and a slightly nutty Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare). Meanwhile back at Mission Control theres a general (Keith David) whos ready to prematurely explode the nuke at the first sign of trouble. Grace Stamper (Liv Tyler) Harrys daughter and A.J.s fiancA(c) is also there making sad faces and whimpering whenever it looks like her father or her boyfriend is about to buy the proverbial farm. While there are a lot of things to complain about concerning Deep Impact the science in that film isnt as laughably absurd as it is in Armageddon. No matter. As an old saying states ""Never let the facts get in the way of a good story."" The problem is its not a good story. Visceral appeal which Armageddon undeniably has can only go so far. However although this film is no more intelligent than Deep Impact it is slightly more enjoyable primarily because its more entertaining to watch space shuttles flee from exploding space stations and dodge cosmic debris than to endure Tea Leoni bonding with Vanessa Redgrave or Maximilian Schell. At 150 minutes in length Armageddon is painfully padded. Why do all effects-driven would-be blockbusters have to last more than 90 minutes? The first hour which establishes the ""characters"" is dull. We really dont need to see 30 minutes of astronaut training. I think some of this material is intended as comic relief but it comes across as silly not funny. In fact I can only remember two jokes that actually work a none-too-subtle jab at Godzilla and an equally obvious reference to Dr. Strangelove. As he has proven in the past (In Country Pulp Fiction) Bruce Willis can act. Hes not doing any of that here however. As Harry Stamper all hes required to do is look cocky make a couple of wise cracks and act courageous. I could say that Willis brings a certain degree of easygoing likability to the character but that would be overanalyzing. On the other hand ""likable"" isnt a word to use for Ben Afflecks A.J. whos a real jerk. Im not sure what Affleck is trying to do with this performance but he didnt get me in his characters corner. Meanwhile Billy Bob Thornton is forgettable as the NASA honcho (compare his work here to Ed Harris superior portrayal of the same sort of individual in Apollo 13) Liv Tyler is on hand exclusively to look pretty (a requirement that doesnt tax her limited acting ability) and Steve Buscemi (re-united with Fargo co-star Peter Stormare) plays the kind of wacko that he does so well. Director Michael Bay (The Rock) pulls out all the stops when it comes to audience manipulation. The President of the United States gives an incredibly over-the-top speech (as in Independence Day) there are long lingering slow motion shots of Harrys team approaching the space craft (as in The Right Stuff) and theres a sequence near the end that might have been touching if it wasnt so overdone. Bay clearly wants his audience to cheer and cry (presumably not at the same time). I didnt feel compelled to do either. Armageddon fills a certain need that summer movie-goers have. The visual effects are suitably impressive the heroes are all bigger-than-life and the pyrotechnics are theater-shaking. In the genre of mindless action/adventure/disaster flicks this is an adequate entry. Armageddon will likely go down as a box-office success because unlike so many other of 1998s summer contenders this one at least delivers what audiences are expecting -- even if thats a sadly-limited order.

Auburn Cinema 17 Bella Bottega Crossroads East Valley 13 Everett Mall 1-3 Factoria Gateway Grand Cinemas Issaquah 9 Kent 6 Kirkland Parkplace Meridian 16 Mountlake 9 Neptune Northgate Puget Park drive-in Southcenter South Hill Mall Woodinville 12. PG-13 - Parental guidance advised because of sci-fi disaster action sensuality and brief language. Poor New York. In ""Deep Impact"" which opened in theaters May 8 a tidal wave flattened the citys skyscrapers. In ""Godzilla"" which arrived just 11 days later a giant lizard razed the high-rises. In ""Armageddon"" which opens today a meteor shower tears through the city trashing Grand Central Station decapitating skyscrapers causing a series of fiery traffic jams and decimating a man wearing an ""I Love New York"" T-shirt. But this is a Jerry Bruckheimer production so the mayhem cant end there. The co-creator of ""The Rock"" ""Top Gun"" and ""Con Air"" never met an explosion he didnt like so theres a new catastrophe every 20 minutes or so. It begins with a flashback to 65 million years ago when an asteroid destroyed the dinosaurs. ""It happened before"" says the narrator Charlton Heston at full biblical throttle. ""It will happen again. Its just a question of when."" The relatively small-scale ""Deep Impact"" threatened us with a comet the size of Manhattan. Bigger but no better ""Armageddon"" gives us an asteroid the size of Texas. Hurtling toward Earth with its accompanying space garbage the huge rock also makes enough noise to cause rock-concert deafness. Supposedly no one can hear you scream in space. But what would a Bruckheimer action movie be without ear-splitting Dolby effects to accompany those explosions? The notion that an asteroid is essentially a silent killer (until its too late) is sacrilege here so theres no opportunity for the creepy silent space deaths so effectively dramatized in ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" In-between the explosions and the surround-sound rumblings theres a kind of a story although its not enough to hold this 2 1/2-hour movie together. Five writers are listed in the on-screen writing credits and even more (including Paul Attanasio and ubiquitous script doctor Robert Towne) are mentioned in the press kit. Alas the only memorable line is ""Houston youve got a problem"" delivered by the hero Harry S. Stamper (Bruce Willis) an astronaut whos feeling betrayed by Mission Control at a particularly tricky moment. The funniest bit Stampers crew demands that theyll never have to pay taxes again if they succeed in blowing up the asteroid. Stamper is actually a deep-core oil driller whos been recruited by NASAs executive director (Billy Bob Thornton) to rendezvous with the big rock drill a hole for a nuclear bomb and set it off in hopes of preventing the pesky thing from colliding with Earth. Hes accompanied by a cast of characters who might as well be called Handsome Surrogate Son (Ben Affleck) Comic Relief (Steve Buscemi) Estranged Father (Will Patton) and Military Nut (William Fichtner). Inevitably the Affleck character is sleeping with Stampers daughter (Liv Tyler) so Stamper has to go through the motions of objecting to the liaison compromising and learning to respect his future son-in-law. Other conflicts and characterizations are even sketchier; a blow-out night before the mission is so uninvolving that it stands out as naked narrative padding. Directed by Michael Bay (also from ""The Rock"") ""Armageddon"" is a confusingly edited and stubbornly stupid movie yet in the end it shares the same problems as ""Deep Impact"" which tried to take a more thoughtful approach to the subject. Neither film can make its characters seem in any way genuine even if their plight generates some sense of identification near the end of their trials. The only compelling lure is the special effects which are sometimes impressive sometimes transparent yet somehow always inadequate to the apocalyptic task at hand.

A deep-core oil driller named Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis). His mission? To lead his trusty crew into space land on the offending rock and drill 800 feet into the surface so that he can implant a nuclear weapon and blow the mother into two pieces which will then shoot past the earth. Watching Armageddon I got the distinct feeling that the director Michael Bay wanted to drill the audience. Bay makes films like a man with a live tiger shark caught in his underwear. The camera never stops moving and the images are edited with such nervous stroboscopic intensity that they seem to be knocking into each other like bumper cars. (Ive seen trailers that were more elegantly directed.) Bay whose previous action-hit cataclysms were Bad Boys and The Rock doesnt stage scenes exactly--he stages moments. You never quite know where you are within a given setting but then at Armageddon a bogus rah-rah spectacle all thats supposed to matter is that youre in the moment. If youre not swept away by the rush thats your problem bud. In the 80s the production team of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer pioneered the cocaine school of adrenalized thriller decadence. Armageddon is the latest Bruckheimer production but it would be honoring Michael Bay to describe the films degraded style of jackhammer visual chaos as ""narcotic."" Its closer to an anxiety attack. Early on after Harry learns that his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) has been sleeping with his studly young right-hand man A.J. (Ben Affleck) he grabs a shotgun and chases A.J. around an oil rig firing at him like some cartoon hillbilly. This is something no sane human being would do; its not even something a Bruce Willis character would do (at least not in those wistful neoclassical days when he starred in relatively coherent movies like Die Hard). This is something a character does when his only real purpose is to provide immediate aggression and movement within an already frenzied frame. In a sense its impossible to criticize a movie like Armageddon since the pictures very shortcomings are the essence of its ""drama."" Training for their mission the men in Willis misfit-renegade team are presented as a slob parody of The Right Stuff and so it hardly matters that the characters are third-generation Xeroxes of cliches from a year or two ago. Thats the whole point; audiences laugh in knowing recognition of the simplemindedness theyre being asked to swallow. Look theres Steve Buscemi doing a milder (though still funny) version of his horny wack job from Con Air. Theres the bald pumped-up basso-profundo black guy (i.e. the Ving Rhames character) and the fat goony passive-aggressive white guy (i.e. the Wayne Knight character). And theres Willis in his latest AstroTurf hairpiece doing his thousandth performance as Bruce Willis. Will someone please give this man a real role? As the films token sweethearts Affleck and Tyler have the distinction of enacting the years most acutely (or do I just mean cutely?) embarrassing love scenes. Making goo-goo eyes over animal crackers theyre like the worlds two most glamorous puppies. The one performer who keeps his dignity and in fact holds the movie together is Billy Bob Thornton cast as a NASA official who bonds with Willis long distance. Terse haunted deadpan Thornton is as low-key authoritative as the rest of the picture is overbearing. After the glumly inert TV-movieish theatrics of Deep Impact which made the end of life as we know it seem oddly soothing (at least compared with the prospect of having to spend another 15 minutes contemplating Tea Leonis news-anchor career woes) Armageddon puts its kick-ass jollies front and center. The movie opens with the destruction of Manhattan by meteor shower and midway through Paris gets wiped out as well. Naturally no one blinks an eye. (The NASA officials seem convinced that the crisis has remained top secret even after New York City is smashed to rubble.) The asteroid itself is an impressive creation all fairy-tale obsidian spikes and crevices. But once Harry and his crew land the film gets weighed down by its own ponderous logistics. Will they mend the broken drill? Will A.J. make it to the site in his intergalactic Range Rover? In Armageddon the world never feels truly at risk but the movie has an apocalyptic thrust all the same. It would love to dance on the grave of cinema as we know it.
