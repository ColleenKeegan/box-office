A smash-and-grab car chase through the streets of some twisty metropolis (say Vienna)? A truck dangling...1997-10-03 C+ The Peacemaker Genre Mystery and Thriller Action/Adventure; Starring George Clooney Nicole Kidman; Director Mimi Leder; MPAA Rating R Posted October 3 1997 -- 1200 AM EDT Quick whats the ultimate thriller cliche? A smash-and-grab car chase through the streets of some twisty metropolis (say Vienna)? A truck dangling off a bridge? A zipper-lipped team of military honchos barreling through the halls of power in order to stop a terrorist from threatening the security of the world? None of those Id argue is quite ultimate enough -- though rest assured you get to see every one of them in The Peacemaker the first feature to emerge from the gates of DreamWorks Pictures the recently launched Spielberg/Katzenberg/Geffen mega-studio. No for the truly quintessential thriller cliche youd have to reach for something like this The heroes trying to stop a bomb from going off with the film cutting back and forth between their sweaty down-to-the-wire electronic tinkering and the bombs telltale timer. This routine was already being tweaked when it was employed in 1964 as the climax of Goldfinger (remember how the bombs ticking clock finally froze on the number 007?) and it has been recycled countless times since. Yet here it is once again in The Peacemaker. (Any bets on whether theyll defuse the bomb in time?) The film may be telling us to get excited -- or more accurately it may be telling us that were more excited than we are -- but thanks to the inviolable law of cliche the essential spark of surprise is missing. The mechanics of ""breathless"" suspense are blanketed by an atmosphere of creeping caution. In The Peacemaker Nicole Kidman as a scientist who heads the White House Nuclear Smuggling Group and George Clooney as Bruce Willis -- I mean as a daredevil intelligence officer with the Armys Special Forces -- team up to stop a Russian general who has swiped 10 nuclear warheads one of which has been promised as payment to a Bosnian terrorist. What does the terrorist intend to do? Well lets just say that hes angry and that he wants to blow up something really important. (He wants you to feel his pain.) In the opening sequence paramilitary soldiers of evil slither onto a train in Russias Ural Mountains and abscond with the nukes setting off one of the warheads in order to cover their tracks. The director Mimi Leder making her feature-film debut after having directed celebrated episodes of ER stages all of this with crisp exactitude and with a pleasing flair for ""rhythmic"" visual detail. The plume of whitish gray smoke that rises from the train and blends into the mountainous dusk the infrared eyes on the masks of the villains the Ivan the Terrible choir on the soundtrack -- all these atmospherics are elegant and accomplished. Theyre also not very thrilling. We know that were watching the setup a mere prelude to the real movie but Leder stages it with an air of self-important solemnity that borders on the overblown. The Peacemaker is a well-crafted utterly generic genre piece that in its slick seamless impersonality seems untouched by human hands; it feels less like a movie than a machine. In recent years such crack entertainments as Speed Crimson Tide and Air Force One have proved that a formula picture neednt feel like one. All thats required is wit brio and curlicues of the unexpected. The Peacemaker though features ersatz wit and it lumbers just when it should build. Were meant to be gripped by the terse romantic chemistry between the two stars -- Clooney the stud agent who shows his partner that you have to break the rules Kidman the cleaned and pressed bureaucrat who teaches him a thing or two about caution. (Is it my imagination or is Kidmans beauty getting paler with each film?) But Clooney looking like a smirky Oliver North gets stuck tossing off stale jingoistic-hipster insults like ""The Russians couldnt find snow in the middle of f--in winter"" Kidman has even less to do. Shes the costar as pretty scenery. A good villain of course can go a long way toward invigorating a thriller. But when we meet The Peacemakers nuclear terrorist he turns out to be a variation on the ancient stereotype of the ""cultured"" Euro-sadist. The films idea of a life-size bad guy is in essence Jeremy Irons with more whining. In The Peacemaker nothing escapes the taint of cliche. As the inaugural feature from DreamWorks the picture is vaguely depressing because it suggests that the studios creators are working so laboriously to manufacture a hit that theyve forgotten to put in the dream.

The big opening action set piece of ""The Peacemaker"" involves a Russian train being robbed of its cargo of nuclear arms while rattling down the track and the entire film sustains that same feeling of being channeled at high speed down an exceedingly narrow path with nary a pause for thought or catching ones breath. This long-anticipated first release from DreamWorks Pictures is an uncommonly dour and even grim action thriller that globetrots as diversely as a James Bond film but offers a very limited view politically emotionally and dramatically. George Clooney and Nicole Kidman arent quite lustrous enough as above-the-title performers to get this lavish entry across on star power alone with OK but less than stellar B.O. the likely result. Deliberately sacrificing such niceties as character development and modulated storytelling for the sake of a full-speed-ahead approach Mimi Leders debut feature attempts to graft the basic components of a doomsday suspenser onto the gritty realities of a ravaged former Yugoslavia and militarily neutered and insidiously corrupt Russia. But all the films stylistic pushiness and manufactured urgency cant compensate for the lack of a compelling hook to pull the audience in and make it stay there other than a generalized and presumed desire to see the good guys i.e. the West survive to fight another day. Pics first 15 minutes are devoted to two incidents in which the viewer is supplied with little orientation and no rooting interest A member of the Bosnian parliament is assassinated and nine nuclear weapons destined for dismantling as part of an international disarmament plan are stolen from the train. A 10th device explodes in a crash causing a devastating blast that initially is said to be big enough to spread fallout over much of the former USSR and Europe but which subsequently impedes none of the action played out in the vicinity. Western intelligence naturally takes a quick interest in the incident and thrust together to piece things together are scientist Dr. Julia Kelly (Kidman) acting head of the White House Nuclear Smuggling Group and U.S. Army Special Forces Lt. Col. Thomas Devoe (Clooney) who has extensive personal contacts in the old Soviet Empire. Their first stop is Vienna where their search for the identity of the vehicle now being used to transport the weapons ends in a rude awakening for Kelly who witnesses the cutthroat brutality with which the old spy game can be played and learns what a tough ruthless customer her companion is when he savagely beats one man then engages three pursuing cars in a deadly game of demolition derby in the middle of a picture-postcard city square; Devoe clearly is a trained-to-kill take-no-prisoners ends-justify-the-means kind of guy. Satellite pictures reveal that the truck bearing the worlds most dangerous illicit merchandise is headed for the Iranian border which occasions the films third major action sequence when Devoe manages to commandeer three attack helicopters and stop the truck in its tracks on a bridge in mountainous terrain. Unfortunately one of the stolen bombs has already disappeared which sends the heroes to New York City where their deductions tell them an upcoming major United Nations peace conference is sure to draw many international figures including perhaps those who got away with the weapon. The action finale which looks as though it must have shut down half of Manhattans East Side to shoot is reasonably impressive but ends with a possibly inevitable but unavoidably hackneyed race with time to save at least part of the civilized world from a nuclear holocaust. Essentially ""The Peacemaker"" is a pursuit story set against a grand and ever-changing international canvas and director Leder best known for her multiple-Emmy-winning work on ""ER"" would seem to have had two principal priorities keeping the picture barreling along in an exceedingly straight line and capturing some vivid local atmosphere along the way. Unfortunately this is not enough to cement much of a bond with the viewer and result of this approach is a picture that feels as though its nearly all second unit or one big uninterrupted action sequence. Based on original spadework done by investigative political journalists Andrew and Leslie Cockburn script by Michael Schiffer (""Crimson Tide"") alternates in its dialogue between information conveyance and shouted commands. Digging with as little depth or nuance as possible into the situations in Russia and the former Yugoslavia pic seizes plausibly enough upon amoral militaristic nationalists and pain-and-loss-wracked survivors of ethnic warfare -- both of whom blame the West in some way for their sorry predicaments -- as those from whom the world has the most to fear. In playing characters devoted to stamping out these threats on behalf of democracy Clooney and Kidman are mainly asked to keep moving most often with urgent dispatch. There are hints at the outset that Clooneys bad-boy officer is meant to be a charming lady killer and professional scoundrel but the attempts to give him Bond-like bon mots are only halfhearted and there is simply no time amidst the chases and explosions for the two characters to develop anything resembling a relationship much less a romance. Each character is meant to be awesomely professional and competent; to this end Clooney supplies a devil-may-care insouciance while Kidman applies an almost fearsomely serious approach. Both thesps are eminently capable but here they dont convey the sort of charisma to suggest larger-than-life figures. Except for Armin Mueller-Stahl whos in briefly as an eminent Russian military vet supporting cast members are essentially unknown and deliver OK work. Pic is notable for its down-and-dirty detail and some of its images such as a convoy of trucks trying to make its way past masses of refugees have force; logistics look to have been staggering across the boards. Technically the work here is very skilled but in the service of a narrowly focused narrative that knows no way to move but straight ahead at full speed.

Starring Nicole Kidman and George Clooney. Directed by Mimi Leder. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) George Clooney must be the most ill-at- ease leading man in films today. In ""The Peacemaker"" he wags his head on every line and avoids eye contact. His rugged good looks spell movie star but his body language spells Don Knotts  without the wit. Occasionally hell lower his head raise his eyes and peek at someone. But then the eyes quickly dart away and the wagging continues until the other person starts talking. Then Clooney stops and looks but his focus seems to remain on himself -- on his effort to seem a certain way. Caring? Suave? Attentive? Hes no cool customer though he plays one on television. All this is not to say that Clooney is terrible in ""The Peacemaker"" a new thriller that opens today. He plays an Army colonel an international opera tive and for the most part hes believable as a guy who knows his way around terrorists and can get Kremlin bigwigs on the phone. But he never appears relaxed even though hes practically playing James Bond. Nicole Kidman co-stars playing a nuclear scientist -- that sounds funny but Kidman makes it work. The scientist who works for the feds is called in when a nuclear bomb is somehow detonated in Russia. That bomb going off signals the real beginning of ""The Peacemaker"" but it takes a good 20 minutes or so for the movie to get there. First theres an interminable and unpleasant opening sequence showing the Russian mafia and Serbian terrorists stealing a trainload of nuclear weapons. The train is robbed to the sound of strings thrumming in a faux Stravinsky way. Some moments are faux ""The Rite of Spring."" Others are faux ""Agon."" Hans Zimmers score at times sounds like the classical equivalent of a Rutles album. The lovely scientist is put in charge of retrieving the lost bombs and the colonel is assigned to assist her. With a smile and a smirk Clooney walks the line showing us that in a macho yet warm way the colonel respects her even though he thinks its ever so mildly amusing to have a lady boss. At times this movies so cute its sickening. But heres the surprise. After a wretched first half hour ""The Peacemaker"" straightens out and becomes a solid thriller. The scene shifts to Vienna where director Mimi Leder stages a car chase -- and actually finds some new turns and swerves. The whole last sequence is tense as well involving a terrorist a bomb and time ticking away. Leder whos making her feature debut is one of the principal directors on the ""ER"" TV series. Against all odds Kidman makes the audience forget the absurdity of the role shes playing. (Under what circumstances would the government leave the fate of life on earth in the hands of an unseasoned bureaucrat whos barely 30?) Choosing to play Dr. Kelly as a harried ambitious young executive Kidman becomes quite sympathetic. She also looks more striking than ever. Her face is now taking on a sharp classic look at least before she starts outrunning fireballs.

"Peacemaker The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; peacemaker-the ) Peacemaker The (United States 1997) A movie review by James Berardinelli When the collaboration of Steven Spielberg Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen on a new production company was first announced it became the talk of the entertainment world. Soon deals were being signed contracts inked and films placed into pre-production. Now more than two years later Dreamworks SKG is ready to release its first motion picture. Much is riding on the pairing of George Clooney and Nicole Kidman in The Peacemaker a marginal thriller that isnt likely to electrify the early Autumn box office. What we have here is basically one very long chase movie. The Peacemaker probably would have been a great deal more successful had the script been tightened and the running time trimmed. Its difficult for anyone to sustain tension and excitement for over two hours and the task proves too difficult for first-time feature director Mimi Leder. The film contains its share of high octane moments (including a car chase through the streets of Vienna that turns into a combination of high-speed bumper cars and chicken) but there are too many times when the proceedings drag. By the time The Peacemaker reaches its long-overdue climax in the streets of New York we just want things to wrap up. The Peacemaker has the globe-trotting approach of a James Bond film although no one is going to mistake the straightforward sometimes-crass approach of George Clooneys Colonel Thomas Devoe for the suave style of 007. Nevertheless Leder keeps the film moving from place-to-place taking in such sites as Sarajevo the Ural Mountains Vienna Turkey and of course the United States. The paper-thin plot has high-ranking assistant-to-the-President Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman) and Devoe on the trail of a group of Russian terrorists who have stolen nine nuclear warheads and appear willing to sell them to the highest bidder (the price tag is somewhere around 200 million). The most dangerous potential buyer is a Serb/Croat (he identifies himself as both) named Duson (Marcel Iures) who blames the West for the slaughter in his country and wants to use a bomb to exact payment in blood. For most of the film Kelly and Devoe are running around trying to stop someone from blowing up one of the weapons. Nicole Kidman has a pretty thankless job here. Shes supposed to be playing a tough intelligent aggressive go-getter but she spends most of her time in the background while George Clooney mugs for the camera or engages in heroics. Clooneys a pleasant enough actor and he fares much better here than in Batman and Robin but it seems to me that hes more suited to lighter material than this. One Fine Day wasnt a great movie but it contained Clooneys best feature performance to date. As an action star Clooney isnt likely to challenge the likes of Schwarzenegger or Connery (then again he can act circles around Steven Seagal -- but so can just about anyone). The Peacemaker is a very violent film with the gore (but not the artistry) of something by Tarantino or Scorsese. There are numerous closeups of bloody shot-up corpses. Plus thrown in for good measure theres a train wreck a missile attack on a helicopter and a nuclear explosion. The body count in this film is easily among the highest of the year but theres a surprising lack of creativity in the way people die. Those that dont get blown up end up with a bullet in their head. The script lets us down significantly on at least two occasions. In the first place a great deal is made about the potential ramifications of a certain ""international incident"" that takes place midway through the film. However immediately after the action takes place the entire matter is dropped. I for one would have liked to have seen at least some of the political fallout from this event. Secondly attempts to humanize the villain are ill-advised. Theres not enough here to make him a sympathetic individual; as a result most of these scenes come across as filler. In movies like this its usually best to have the bad guy be a megalomaniac rather than a figure who could have walked out of one of Shakespeares tragedies. The Peacemaker isnt much better or worse than the average James Bond movie except of course that it doesnt have the cars the gadgets the girls or Bond himself. Theres a certain appeal to the premise but the execution is uneven. The movie is likely to keep an audiences attention but its the kind of film that is quickly forgotten. As the debut feature of a new production company it isnt likely to be an unmitigated failure but neither will it prove to be a stunning financial success. Despite all the bullets bodies and bangs Dreamworks is not off to a flying start.

A truck dangling...1997-10-03 C+ The Peacemaker Genre Mystery and Thriller Action/Adventure; Starring George Clooney Nicole Kidman; Director Mimi Leder; MPAA Rating R Posted October 3 1997 -- 1200 AM EDT Quick whats the ultimate thriller cliche? A smash-and-grab car chase through the streets of some twisty metropolis (say Vienna)? A truck dangling off a bridge? A zipper-lipped team of military honchos barreling through the halls of power in order to stop a terrorist from threatening the security of the world? None of those Id argue is quite ultimate enough -- though rest assured you get to see every one of them in The Peacemaker the first feature to emerge from the gates of DreamWorks Pictures the recently launched Spielberg/Katzenberg/Geffen mega-studio. No for the truly quintessential thriller cliche youd have to reach for something like this The heroes trying to stop a bomb from going off with the film cutting back and forth between their sweaty down-to-the-wire electronic tinkering and the bombs telltale timer. This routine was already being tweaked when it was employed in 1964 as the climax of Goldfinger (remember how the bombs ticking clock finally froze on the number 007?) and it has been recycled countless times since. Yet here it is once again in The Peacemaker. (Any bets on whether theyll defuse the bomb in time?) The film may be telling us to get excited -- or more accurately it may be telling us that were more excited than we are -- but thanks to the inviolable law of cliche the essential spark of surprise is missing. The mechanics of ""breathless"" suspense are blanketed by an atmosphere of creeping caution. In The Peacemaker Nicole Kidman as a scientist who heads the White House Nuclear Smuggling Group and George Clooney as Bruce Willis -- I mean as a daredevil intelligence officer with the Armys Special Forces -- team up to stop a Russian general who has swiped 10 nuclear warheads one of which has been promised as payment to a Bosnian terrorist. What does the terrorist intend to do? Well lets just say that hes angry and that he wants to blow up something really important. (He wants you to feel his pain.) In the opening sequence paramilitary soldiers of evil slither onto a train in Russias Ural Mountains and abscond with the nukes setting off one of the warheads in order to cover their tracks. The director Mimi Leder making her feature-film debut after having directed celebrated episodes of ER stages all of this with crisp exactitude and with a pleasing flair for ""rhythmic"" visual detail. The plume of whitish gray smoke that rises from the train and blends into the mountainous dusk the infrared eyes on the masks of the villains the Ivan the Terrible choir on the soundtrack -- all these atmospherics are elegant and accomplished. Theyre also not very thrilling. We know that were watching the setup a mere prelude to the real movie but Leder stages it with an air of self-important solemnity that borders on the overblown. The Peacemaker is a well-crafted utterly generic genre piece that in its slick seamless impersonality seems untouched by human hands; it feels less like a movie than a machine. In recent years such crack entertainments as Speed Crimson Tide and Air Force One have proved that a formula picture neednt feel like one. All thats required is wit brio and curlicues of the unexpected. The Peacemaker though features ersatz wit and it lumbers just when it should build. Were meant to be gripped by the terse romantic chemistry between the two stars -- Clooney the stud agent who shows his partner that you have to break the rules Kidman the cleaned and pressed bureaucrat who teaches him a thing or two about caution. (Is it my imagination or is Kidmans beauty getting paler with each film?) But Clooney looking like a smirky Oliver North gets stuck tossing off stale jingoistic-hipster insults like ""The Russians couldnt find snow in the middle of f--in winter"" Kidman has even less to do. Shes the costar as pretty scenery. A good villain of course can go a long way toward invigorating a thriller. But when we meet The Peacemakers nuclear terrorist he turns out to be a variation on the ancient stereotype of the ""cultured"" Euro-sadist. The films idea of a life-size bad guy is in essence Jeremy Irons with more whining. In The Peacemaker nothing escapes the taint of cliche. As the inaugural feature from DreamWorks the picture is vaguely depressing because it suggests that the studios creators are working so laboriously to manufacture a hit that theyve forgotten to put in the dream.
