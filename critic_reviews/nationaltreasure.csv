Ive been in theme-park haunted houses with much scarier lighting but the moment works because Bruce Greenwood who has played the president once before (in the monumental Thirteen Days) twinkles with the pleasure of high command especially when he tells Ben about the Presidents Secret Book. Its a compendium of privileged data -- including everything from the missing 18 1?2 minutes of Watergate tape to the truth about the Apollo moon missions -- that gets passed from each chief executive to the next. Ben figures that the book might be of help since hes trying to prove that his great-great-grandfather was a Civil War hero and not in fact the man who masterminded a conspiracy to kill Abraham Lincoln. Ben like the movie never actually questions the existence of such a plot; he simply wants to clear his relatives name. From the shadow associates of John Wilkes Booth to a hidden pact between Queen Victoria and the Confederacy Book of Secrets might best be called a crock of intrigue. Like the first National Treasure (2004) its a Styrofoam-cave cliff-hanger posing as a scavenger hunt all dressed up as a Da Vinci Code version of U.S. history. Yet this film does have a bit more spunk and drive than the first. Director Jon Turteltaub has fun with Indian glyphs giant stone pulleys and an Indy Jones-worthy City of Gold located beneath the rocky shoals of Mount Rushmore. Cage trying to be light looks about as gaunt as a Tim Burton ghoul but hes got a great bit paging through the book of secrets and skipping the part about the JFK assassination because they dont have time. Jon Voight as Bens father and Helen Mirren as his linguist mom are touchingly embattled. The movie is about as nourishing as a bowl of trail mix but its hard to stop eating. Whats next for National Treasure -- the Teapot Dome scandal? Los Alamos? The mind boggles as history trembles.

"Book More Sparkling Treasure washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Book More Sparkling Treasure Brainy adventurer Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage flanked by Helen Mirren and Diane Kruger) is back in ""Book of Secrets."" (By Robert Zuckerman -- Disney Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 21 2007 Benjamin Franklin Gates is a movie hero of the old school a dashing treasure hunter with an obsessive interest in American history. Played by Nicolas Cage in the 2004 hit ""National Treasure"" Gates emerged as a new kind of leading man one with the brains of Stephen Ambrose and the brawn of Indiana Jones. His idea of adventure is less to scale tall buildings than plumb the depths of the National Archives. Cage is back in crackling good form in ""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" and its clear that with this installment the filmmakers (producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Jon Turteltaub) intend for the franchise to resuscitate the derring-do and lighthearted entertainment of Saturday matinee serials of yore. And as a larky popcorn romp ""Book of Secrets"" indeed recalls those classics right down to the opening Disney cartoon short in which Goofy buys a big-screen TV. (Just like the old days sort of.) ""Book of Secrets"" finds Gates faced with an unpleasant twist in his vaunted family history It seems that his great-grandfather long venerated as the man who in 1865 burned a page of John Wilkes Booths diary in order to prevent the Confederacy from acquiring a cache of gold was actually in on the scheme. At an academic conference Ben and his father (Jon Voight) are confronted by an amateur historian (Ed Harris) who has his own tattered page of the diary proving that the Gates ancestor was no Civil War hero. Thus ""Book of Secrets"" makes its own kind of history if only to propose a Washington scandal about a page that actually has to do with a piece of paper. Ben and his father swiftly set out to prove Wilkinson wrong enlisting the plucky team from the first movie Bens now-estranged girlfriend (Diane Kruger) and his nerdy wisecracking sidekick (Justin Bartha). Leading the team on a whirlwind worldwide tour from Washington to Paris to London and back Ben stops along the way to chat with his mother (Helen Mirren) about some ancient Native American hieroglyphs finally leading the whole fam damily to Mount Rushmore for a spectacular finale. (Mirren following in her Oscar-winning sisters footsteps by stepping straight into a big-bucks blockbuster seems to enjoy herself thoroughly as the University of Marylands most tartly alluring history professor.) Its been said by a far smarter colleague than I that the ""National Treasure"" movies are what ""The Da Vinci Code"" should have been and I see my colleagues point. Theres a swiftness and swashbuckling sparkle to the enterprise that makes it enjoyable if not particularly edifying viewing This is after all a film that shows the sign outside the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building then self-importantly types out the same words at the bottom of the screen. But if viewers can overlook some of the more blatant dumb-isms ""Book of Secrets"" provides its own good-natured brand of pulp pleasure if only because it so guilelessly engages in the kind of conspiracy-mongering that would have Oliver Stone ritually pilloried. Everything from the JFK assassination to Area 51 is whiffed in this story which comes to pivot on the existence of a secret presidential book that may or may not hold the key to every unsolved mystery since the founding of the Freemasons. What makes the ""National Treasure"" series so diabolically hilariously brilliant is that it panders to both American paranoia and patriotic optimism. Its no secret which impulse wins the day as ""Book of Secrets"" takes viewers along on a rollicking caper that exists outside any conventional time frame. Leave the stopwatch at home and just enjoy the films eye-popping set pieces which include a sensational car chase through London (culminating in an ale-soaked run-in with a Fullers lorry) and a climactic showdown in which Cage and Harris balancing on an enormous pre-Columbian bongo board seem to be competing for whos just reached the lowest point of his career. Indeed its difficult to watch Cage impersonate a drunken visitor to Buckingham Palace and not be reminded of his searing Oscar-winning performance in ""Leaving Las Vegas."" Now he appears in movies where he rides a motorcycle while his head bursts into flames. Between those two poles ""Book of Secrets"" isnt Cages lowest point but rather represents a happy medium allowing him to overact with abandon and have fun along the way. Its clear that everyone involved in ""Book of Secrets"" is having fun and with expectations properly managed the audience will too. Among the movies retro charms is that it aims to be the kind of wholesome entertainment that parents can enjoy along with their teens and tweens inviting the whole family along as it careers between shots of dusty old books and high-tech computer screens. Just like the old days. Sort of. National Treasure Book of Secrets (120 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some violence and action.

Comments National Treasure Book of Secrets I havent seen the original but the absurd high-concept of this sequel appears to be quite similar its a Disney romp with several stars (Nicolas Cage Diane Kruger Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel from the first movie plus Ed Harris and Helen Mirren) appearing in and around various international monuments as they pursue a centuries-old treasure with arcane clues and sliding panels. All this climaxes in an underground city of gold out of H. Rider Haggard located close to Mount Rushmore. Leave it to coproducer Jerry Bruckheimer to revive the Indiana Jones cycle without the period setting the camp elements or Spielbergs efficiency; director Jon Turteltaub just plods along and the script by Marianne and Cormac Wibberley is equally poker-faced. With Justin Bartha and Bruce Greenwood the latter playing the U.S. president. PG 124 min.

"Book of Secrets Beyond belief | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBook of Secrets Beyond belief Heres my suggestion for chapter three of National Treasure the increasingly unhinged adventure franchise in which Nicolas Cage plays a history nerd on steroids.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 21 2007 Book of SecretsStarring Nicolas Cage Diane Kruger Justin Bartha Jon Voight Helen Mirren and Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Jon Turteltaub. 123 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Article Continued BelowHeres my suggestion for chapter three of National Treasure the increasingly unhinged adventure franchise in which Nicolas Cage plays a history nerd on steroids.I know Im getting ahead of myself. But its just too exciting.Cage and his fellow freaks and relations seek to uncover the real assassin of JFK. The truth is in a chest buried with the remains of Noahs Ark atop Mount Ararat. The only way to get there is in a balloon once owned by Phileas Fogg. Unbeknownst to our heroes theyre being tailed by a flying saucer filled with villains played by all six James Bond actors from Connery to Craig.""Preposterous"" you cry. ""Who would ever believe that?""To which I reply ""Wait until you see chapter two ...""National Treasure Book of Secrets opening today at discerning multiplexes everywhere has more hilarious accidents than Jamie Lynn Spearss birth-control methods. It is so far-fetched it makes the original story about stealing the Declaration of Independence seem as solid as granite. Much of it is entertaining but all of it is ridiculous.This time its personal for Cages history buff Ben Gates and his university professor pappy Patrick (Jon Voight). Theyve just learned - but refuse to accept - that great-grandfather Gates was a leading conspirator in the April 1865 assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth an event seen in flashback.They doubt the motives of Booth relation Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) who has produced mysterious missing diary pages that he claims clear the name of his benighted family.Revealing the truth of the situation will require trips to around and inside the Eiffel Tower Buckingham Palace the White House Mount Rushmore and other historical sites because as we all know clues are never hidden in places that are easy to get to. Before that happens Ben must reconcile with his brainiac ex-girlfriend Abigail (Diane Kruger) and Patrick must break 32 years worth of ice with his long-divorced wife Emily (a stunt-cast Helen Mirren) who happens to be an ace symbol decoder.Did you ever think you could sneak into the Queens private study or the presidents Oval Office? Or that you could kidnap the president (played well by Canadas Bruce Greenwood) in hopes of cajoling out of him the location of a secret book containing the answer to every wild conspiracy theory? Or that Mount Rushmore might be more than just a heady tourist attraction?That flying saucer doesnt sound so crazy anymore does it? But as Bens techno-flunky buddy Riley (Justin Bartha) sagely observes ""Last time I checked we pretty much make our living on crazy""Right on Riley but does it have to be completely insane? I must admit I approached the original National Treasure in 2004 as just a pre-emptive ripoff of The Da Vinci Code. But then the Code imploded from its bloated sense of self-importance and National Treasure looked like a jolly romp in hindsight.Book of Secrets has the energy levels right - it would make a great pinball machine or cartoon - and returning director Jon Turteltaub and his committee of writers have the correct sequel instincts by upping the ante for stakes both patriotic and personal.Yet as much as you want to applaud the movies winking commitment to its own Looney Tunes logic its frustrating when lazy and illogical plot devices are used like cattle prods. Riley (yawn) is able to instantly tap into the most secure of databases while escaping bullets and banditos just like every computer geek since Poindexter. Ben (ho-hum) and his cronies have to negotiate a tilting rock slab set eons ago by puzzle-crazed ancients who apparently had nothing better to do than copy hoary action-movie cliches. And theres more much more.If only all concerned had just listened to the plea by Ed Harriss wily Wilkinson ""No more puzzles Ben""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

All rights reserved. No photo credit NT2_Still_Pulls_03 Pictured Left to right Diane Kruger Justin Bartha Nicolas Cage Movie Review ""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" with Nicolas Cage Justin Bartha Diane Kruger Jon Voight Helen Mirren Ed Harris Harvey Keitel and Bruce Greenwood. Directed by John Turteltaub from a screenplay by Cormac Wibberley and Marianne Wibberley. 124 minutes. Rated PG for some violence and action. Several theaters. Almost in spite of itself ""National Treasure"" defied sniping critics and became one of the surprise blockbusters of 2004 combining family-friendly popcorn thrills with an enjoyable blend of Hardy Boys mystery Indiana Jones adventure and ludicrous plotting. As a newly minted franchise from uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer it was ""The Da Vinci Code"" for the PlayStation set promising multiplatform merchandising and a sequel mandated by the success of its opening weekend. Perhaps that explains why ""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" feels like it was made out of obligation to Disney stockholders as opposed to springing from anything resembling inspiration. From start to finish this lavish nonsensical product of Hollywood greed betrays the creative ennui of everyone involved. Their paychecks were obviously generous; theres no other explanation for watching talented people embarrass themselves so badly. And so it is that we find the likes of Ed Harris Jon Voight and Helen Mirren (yes ""The Queen"" herself) tumbling around in a cavernous catacomb with fellow Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage as they discover a massive Native American city of gold hidden in the bowels of the Black Hills under the gaze of the faces on Mount Rushmore. According to the movies by-the-numbers logic that setting is historically significant The so-called ""Book of Secrets"" is known only to U.S. presidents and contains the mother lode of state secrets from the truth about JFKs assassination to the cover-up at Area 51 and the location of the aforementioned city of gold. For intrepid treasure-seeker Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage looking desperate for a hit) the book holds the key to restoring his familys reputation smeared by an allegation that Gates great-great grandfather was a conspirator in the Lincoln assassination. The movies convoluted hide-and-seek plot also demands a White House break-in that makes about as much sense as subprime mortgage rates but that doesnt stop Gates and his reunited sidekicks (Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha) from staying a step ahead of a villainous treasure-stealer (Harris) whos got his own reputation to repair. While Gates divorced parents (Voight and Mirren) bicker for witless comic relief Gates resorts to irrational strategies such as kidnapping the current U.S. president (Bruce Greenwood) and re-enacting several scenes from ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Perhaps the clearest indication of creative bankruptcy is the contrived climax involving a massive tilting platform upon which our heroes must delicately balance themselves or fall to their certain deaths down a seemingly bottomless chasm. This idea is blatantly stolen from the Oscar-winning West German animated short ""Balance"" (1989) which packed more cleverness suspense and substance into seven minutes than this bloated arcade game can muster in two mindless hours.

Photo ROBERT ZUCKERMAN Review National Treasure sequel a history lesson for the family 1 / 3 Back to Gallery National TreasureBook of Secrets Action adventure. Starring Nicolas Cage Justin Bartha Jon Voight Helen Mirren and Ed Harris. Directed by Jon Turteltaub. (PG. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For the sake of this countrys security lets all hope that no one in al Qaeda is watching ""National Treasure Book of Secrets."" If you believe the movie the only thing easier than breaking into the presidents Oval Office desk is kidnapping our commander in chief from a heavily guarded dinner party. This American history-themed action thriller doesnt get many points for realism but it makes up ground in so many other areas that you probably wont care. Perhaps most important its a welcome throwback to the kind of family-friendly PG moviemaking that we used to get in the early 1980s when only the bad guys had guns our heroes had multiple doctorates and an 80-year-old could enjoy the film on the same level as his 10-year-old grandson. Imagine a really good Hardy Boys mystery without all the sexual tension. The movies only big problems are a lack of rousing action sequences and a bloated running time two issues that dont complement each other well. Assuming that your movie doesnt have at least two ""Braveheart""-caliber action scenes a minute longer than an hour and 45 minutes is too long for this kind of entertainment. At the center of the ""National Treasure"" sequel is Nicolas Cage who gets a lot of criticism for taking these second-rate action movie roles but never phones them in. He returns as ""treasure protector"" Benjamin Franklin Gates who hunts down famous objects to keep them out of the hands of bad men who dont appreciate their historical value. Although the movie is propelled by real events in American history its best that audience members leave their cognitive abilities at the door. The plot of ""Book of Secrets"" - in 25 words or less - involves searching for a lost City of Gold in an effort to clear Gates great-great-grandfathers name as a co-conspirator in Abraham Lincolns death. Along the way we find out that Area 51 is real the Statue of Liberty is really just one big treasure map clue and major newspapers can be manipulated by the executive branch of the government. But its hard not to want to go along for the ride in part because everyone involved with the movie seems completely aware of the ridiculousness and embraces it with little jokes and other nods. ""The Kennedy assassination"" Gates peppy sidekick Riley exclaims as the partners quickly leaf through a presidential book that contains the answers to all the big conspiracy theories in American history. ""Shh"" Gates exclaims looking for a piece of information that will exonerate his ancestor. ""We dont have time"" ""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" would seem like more of a B movie if it wasnt filled with such a dream cast. You can watch every Oscar film this year and you probably wont find a better group of actors than Cage Jon Voight Helen Mirren Ed Harris Bruce Greenwood and Harvey Keitel. Of the above only Harris constantly looks as if he wishes he were in another movie. Mirren is particularly swell as Cages cantankerous mother who hasnt spoken to his father (Voight) in 32 years mostly because shes such a royal pain. Of significant note for Mirren stalkers the ""Prime Suspect"" star continues to get exponentially hotter as she ages perhaps because shes one of the only actresses older than 32 who doesnt have a weekly date with a cosmetic surgeon. Unfortunately even a collection of treasure-hunting Oscar winners can wear out their welcome in a 124-minute movie especially when the action scenes are so tepid including a climax on a giant spinning waffle iron thing that is as boring as it sounds. Though director Jon Turteltaub (""Phenomenon"") has a knack for family filmmaking he cant shoot a car chase to save his life. You could plant a couple of cameras in the parking lot of your local Safeway for two hours and get more spine-tingling adventure than whats available in ""Book of Secrets."" But even when the movie gets slow there are enough feel-good moments to keep audiences engaged. This is the kind of movie where the president might use his executive powers to fix someones parking ticket. And in this movies Disneyfied universe it seems like a good allocation of his time. -- Advisory This movie contains a few mildly violent action sequences sexual innuendo and the least convincing performance by an actor playing Abraham Lincoln since ""Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure.""

"National Treasure Book of Secrets | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; national-treasure-book-of-secrets ) National Treasure Book of Secrets (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli How to review a movie thats essentially a copy of its predecessor? The temptation is to simply copy what I wrote about the first National Treasure into this space with a few minor edits to account for name and location changes. Everything from the earlier review is valid for this chapter. Not only are the movies so similar as to be largely indistinguishable but they regurgitate identical problems. (The saying goes ""if it aint broke dont fix it."" What if it is broke but no one cares?) In fairness it should be noted that the original National Treasure developed a surprisingly large following and its a pretty good bet that those who liked the first movie will probably appreciate the second. After all its not much different than popping the older feature in the DVD player. National Treasure did an excellent job of illustrating how perpetual motion in a movie can be boring. Book of Secrets makes sure that if we missed the lesson the first time around were going to be given a second chance. The film is all about moving from Location A to Location B chasing down an improbable clue being chased by misguided lawmen or poorly motivated bad guys throwing in a little exposition then moving to the next place and repeating. To make sure the formula for Book of Secrets doesnt vary from that of National Treasure the climax occurs underground with things collapsing. The ""peril"" our heroes find themselves in isnt the kind that will get the blood pumping. In fact I doubt my pulse was elevated at any time during the proceedings. Book of Secrets is a second-rate rip-off of Tomb Raider which was in its own right a second-rate rip-off of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The movie goes out of its way to appeal to conspiracy buffs. In fact thats its main lure since the generic and uninteresting action is unlikely to draw a lot of viewers. However the conspiracy angle is another matter; people eat that stuff up. Thats why The Da Vinci Code is so popular. The conspiracies explored in Book of Secrets are poorly conceived but I suppose they might make sense for anyone who pretends not to know much about history and resolutely refuses to think about the details. Those who have minds equipped with a shut-off switch will enjoy what Book of Secrets has to offer far more than those forced to think at any point during this movie. Whats somewhat shocking is the amount of star power and talent latent in the cast. There are three Oscar winners (Helen Mirren John Voight Nicolas Cage) and two nominees (Ed Harris Harvey Keitel). Jerry Bruckheimer must pay really well to stack the deck like that yet director Jon Turteltaub (who foisted the first National Treasure upon us) has no idea how to use his actors. The pacing would have improved dramatically if Mirren and Voights unnecessary characters had been snipped. Cage provides us with a bland generic erratic genius and risk-taker. Harris who has played the heavy from time-to-time throughout his career forgets hes supposed to be menacing. (Not that his character is given a consistent motivation. His about-faces are enough to give one whiplash.) Keitel appears and disappears as required by the plot and never accomplishes much of anything. Without going into too much detail which would reveal how little sense the underlying premise makes treasure hunter Ben Gates (Cage) is out to prove that his great-great grandfather didnt participate in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In order to do this he must find the fabled lost City of Gold. The route to discovery lies in peeking under the Queens desk in Buckingham Palace providing a similar inspection of its twin in the Oval Office and kidnapping the President of the United States (Bruce Greenwood who once played President Kennedy). Aiding Ben in his efforts are his father Patrick (Jon Voight); his mother Emily (Helen Mirren); his former girlfriend Abigail (Diane Kruger); and his annoying sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha). The villain is Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) who wants to beat Ben to the discovery and is willing to kill and maim to achieve that aim. Book of Secrets has enough running around to delight fans of TVs The Amazing Race and it isnt deficient in action. Whats missing is excitement. Students of movies understand that this equivalency is not true action = excitement. Other elements beside movement and chaos are needed to elevate the adrenaline level. Book of Secrets doesnt have them. The car chases are a good example. The average car chase is dull enough to put an overcaffeinated movie-goer to sleep yet this is exactly what Turteltaub gives us (and not once but twice). Everything in this movie is done according to formula without a moments variation. The pacing is off with the bloated 130 minute length providing ample evidence. The experience of watching this production is dispiriting because the whole thing is so repetitive and unnecessary. Rarely have I had such a powerful sense of dA(c)jA  vu while watching a motion picture. Is it possible to enjoy Book of Secrets? Obviously although its lunacy requires a level of suspension of disbelief that some will be incapable of attaining. When the laws of logic and physics are so willfully ignored in a world that is supposed to represent our own it can be difficult to go along for the ride. ""Mindless"" applies and Book of Secrets is more like a tame endlessly repetitive amusement park ride than a motion picture. I get what this movie is trying to do but it doesnt work for me. Book of Secrets deserves to be kept closed.

Remember when I used to make quiet movies for smart people? Things have CHANGED. ""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" is my latest LOUD movie for IDIOTS. Its another flick about maps landmarks and buried treasure that makes ""The Da Vinci Code"" look like TOLSTOY. Remember how cleverly one clue led to the next in ""National Treasure""? The sequel is more like CONNECT-THE-DOTS. And yes I do continue to develop my HABIT of suddenly YELLING in the middle of a sentence. Im not a SUBTLE actor and if you want a subtle movie GET OUT OF MY FACE. This ones about how my character Benjamin Franklin Gates learns that an ancestor collided with the John Wilkes Booth gang who wanted him to decipher a page from Booths diary that may have been part of a TREASURE MAP. I have to FIND IT because that will clear my great-great-grandfather of taking part in the Lincoln assassination. How does my finding treasure prove my ancestor had nothing to do with Lincolns killing? DONT THINK SO MUCH EGGBERT. My girlfriend (Diane Kruger) and I have broken up. So naturally she helps me do some spectral imaging of Booths papers to discover a SECRET CODE. Ed Harris plays a BAD GUY who keeps SHOOTING AT ME. When he has the means to track everything I do without my knowing about it instead I get in a CAR CHASE with him in London for NO REASON. If you have ever been to London and noticed that you couldnt have a car chase that lasted more than 14 seconds because of traffic STAY AWAY FROM MY MOVIE EINSTEIN. During the car chase we all engage in WITTY REPARTEE like this ""Theyre getting closer"" ""Whats their problem?"" Later Harris gets to say with a straight face ""You try any funny business I guarantee you people are gonna get hurt"" You dont like it? Go see a COEN BROTHERS movie BRAINIAC. I read an inscription at a replica of the Statue of Liberty in Paris about ""resolute twins"" and INSTANTLY figure out that this is a CODED REFERENCE to a desk of Queen Victorias and the desk of the American president. Naturally the priceless royal artifact is kept in Buckingham Palace ALONE AND UNGUARDED so I get to SPEND ALL THE TIME I WANT with it to figure out the next clue. Later I will discover that ANYONE who knows ANYONE who works in THE WHITE HOUSE can have as much time as he wants to GO POKING AROUND IN THE PRESIDENTS DESK. Yes THAT president. Im not talking about the president of HAIR CLUB FOR MEN. I need lots of supplies for this mission like LAME ONE-LINERS and EXPOSITION which are supplied respectively by my sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha) and my history expert dad (Jon Voight). My mom who hasnt talked to my dad in years turns out to be HELEN MIRREN meaning this is the worst movie to star three or more Oscar winners since ""AIRPORT FRICKIN 77."" More than AN HOUR into the movie we all start yammering about a SECRET BOOK KNOWN ONLY TO PRESIDENTS that has all the riddles of the country in it like the missing minutes from the Watergate tapes and the real deal on the Kennedy assassination. How can this stuff remain secret when control of the White House keeps flipping between OPPOSING PARTIES? Youre not LISTENING to me GENIUS. Check your BRAINBOX at the DOOR. So I have to talk to the PRESIDENT. Did you know anyone wearing a TUXEDO can sneak into one of his FANCY PARTIES walk up to him and get his UNDIVIDED ATTENTION for AS LONG AS YOU WANT? If youre nice to him you can get him to follow you ALONE into some SECRET CAVES under MOUNT VERNON. When we all wind up under MOUNT RUSHMORE there are lots of golden idols and elaborate booby traps and perilous passageways and giant boulders rolling across doorways. You may think youve already seen ""RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK"" but you havent seen anything until youve seen it remade in GLORIOUS MORONORAMA. kyle.smithnypost.com NATIONAL TREASURE BOOK OF SECRETS 1/2National calamity.Running time 124 minutes.

So are we. BY Jack Mathews Tuesday June 3 2008 346 PM National Treasure Book of Secrets. A treasure hunter tries to clear his ancestor of his alleged involvement in Abraham Lincolns assassination. With Nicholas Cage Diane Kruger Jon Voight Helen Mirren. Director John Turteltaub (210). PG-13 Mild violence. At area theaters.Somewhere in the Black Hills of South Dakota near Mount Rushmore where the great ""North by Northwest"" took us in better movie times is the entrance to a pre-Columbian City of Gold.The city the climactic destination of Jon Turteltaubs ""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" is important not only for its stored fortune but as evidence that Thomas Gates the great-great-grandfather of treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) was not involved in the plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. One thing to be said for the hacks who dream up these ""National Treasure"" plots they think big. In the first film Gates was following clues to get to a treasure buried by Americas Founding Fathers. In the second our hero kidnaps the current U.S. President (Bruce Greenwood) in order to solve the murder of the 16th. Along the way Gates his girlfriend Abigail (Diane Kruger) and his techno-nerd sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha) break into the Queens quarters in Buckingham Palace talk their way into the Oval Office and sneak into the Library of Congress to find a book containing the countrys greatest secrets. The book sends everyone - Ben his friends his parents (Jon Voight and Helen Mirren) and the villain stalking them - to South Dakota for an Indiana Jones-style adventure inside the great cave. The villain is Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) a descendant of pro-Confederate northerners who were trying to find the City of Gold in order to prolong the Civil War. A century and a half later Mitch shows up with a letter implicating Thomas Gates in the Lincoln plot. That accusation prompts Ben and his proud dad to find the City of Gold themselves and clear the family name. If there was an iota of plausibility to any of this we could forgive the films greater leaps of imagination - all those break-ins of absurdly unprotected bastions of Western civilization. But this is not audience-participation suspense. All you can do is sit and watch and wish there was more wonder.

This sequel to the phenomenally successful 2004 history-and-stunts adventure returns us to a world of convoluted conspiracies legendary troves of gold and patchy plotting barely held together by the frenetic overacting of Nicolas Cage and company. If the film took itself at all seriously it would be intolerable but any movie that casts comic book fan Cage as a brilliant historian is goofing with us so the best path is to shrug and enjoy the pretty locales. Besides its refreshing to see an action movie whose hero is a brainiac pacifist. As before Cage is out to clear his family name besmirched by Ed Harris who presents evidence that links Cages great-granddad to the Lincoln assassination. Cage faces family difficulties in the present as well. He has left girlfriend Diane Kruger because of her overuse of the word ""so"" and moved in with his long-divorced father Jon Voight. Close examination of John Wilkes Booths diary points to the existence of a Mayan treasure but Cage cant decipher the hieroglyphics without the help of his mother sending dad into comic paroxysms of opposition. As Cage follows a bread-crumb trail of clues from Paris to London to Mount Rushmore Harris shows up from time to time for a Jerry Bruckheimer Car Chase Sequence. The film is baffling -- the scheme that links the conspirators throughout three centuries would flummox the Illuminati -- but as a sort of vacation scrapbook of the lovely places where the cast spent last summer its pleasant enough. They do seem to be having fun. Cage goes mental in a scene at Buckingham Palace; the ruses they employ to get into high-security areas are Scooby-Doo dumb (carry a vase of flowers and no one will question you) and Justin Bartha injects the story with happy juice as Cages underappreciated techie sidekick. As an added treat the Disney company opens the feature with a new Goofy cartoon about the clumsy Everydogs misadventures installing his new home theater system. The delirious short subject alone is worth the price of admission; consider the movie a cheesy side dish.

(Robert zuckerman/disney enterprises) Email|Print| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / December 21 2007 Can you imagine how dreadful the ""National Treasure"" movies would be if Nicolas Cage werent in them? Another star might make the mistake of taking the franchise seriously whereas Cage cocks his hairpiece sets his inner ham on stun and sallies forth to dispense nuggets of US history while jumping over pits of fire. Hes alive to the joke of a superhero academic.""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" is often as noisy dippy and enjoyable as 2004s ""National Treasure"" and when its not its just another sequel more absurd than most. But absurdity is this series meat What other movie would make a lark out of kidnapping the US president? Or try to get us to buy a high-speed car chase in notoriously congested London?Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer with all spigots open and directed once again by journeyman Jon Turteltaub the new ""National Treasure"" sends Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage) on a fresh scavenger hunt around the monuments of Western Civ. At stake is more than just Cibola the conquistadors Lost City of Gold but the Gates family name. A villainous interloper named Wilkinson (Ed Harris) has come forth with evidence that Bens great-grandfather led the plot to assassinate Lincoln. Base calumnyHow a chase after treasure will prove the ancestors innocence is never entirely clear and anyway the movies too busy straining to reconvene the troops from the first one Bens estranged historian girlfriend Abigail (Diane Kruger) his comic-relief tech specialist Riley (Justin Bartha) professor father Patrick (Jon Voight). The ""National Treasure"" movies give you two hams for the price of one and for gravy heres Harvey Keitel replaying his FBI agent with bizarre facial hair and Helen Mirren - the Queen herself - having a high old time as Emily Bens mother and Patricks very divorced ex-wife.Its the kind of movie where moms a specialist in ancient Olmec because thats what the plot requires just then. After shopping for clues at the Statue of Liberty in Paris (thats right) and a high-spirited plundering of Buckingham Palace Ben and company come up with an ancient Native American treasure map not to mention the novel (and wholly false) tidbit that Queen Victoria sent aid to the Civil War Confederacy.As in all sequels the formula has hardened. Ben acts crazy and cross-references historical trivia until he deciphers a clue the team advances to the next step of the hunt then theres a rip-snorting action sequence. Rinse repeat. The only time this varies is during the above-mentioned kidnapping of the president so Ben can get at a clue in the Presidents Book a legendary tome containing all the nations paranoid secrets.Luckily the president turns out to be nice old Bruce Greenwood who played JFK in ""Thirteen Days"" so he already has more presence than any sitting president you can think of. Hes a fan of Bens work too and their relationship is as close to a buddy film as ""Book of Secrets"" gets. The next ""National Treasure"" awkwardly set up here looks to feature this friendship more heavily.As long as its galloping along the movies perfectly good popcorn - in itself a rarity these days - but eventually you get down to the burnt kernels at the bottom of the bag. Like this one How on earth did the Olmecs of south-central Mexico come to build a city beneath the Black Hills of South Dakota? Or this one Why cant Harriss character make up his mind and be either a good guy or a bad guy? The films US history may be right but its GPS is busted and the screenwriting needs an overhaul.A scene late in the film finds the principals standing precariously on a massive stone teeter-totter above an underground abyss. That about sums it up Cage and the filmmakers do a fine job balancing this anvil for as long as they can. Eventually it all comes crashing down and we can go home to tend to our happily aching heads.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

By David Germain updated 12/20/2007 40022 PM ET 2007-12-20T210022 Print Font + - REVIEW The founding fathers of the ""National Treasure"" franchise wisely know not to tinker with a formula that inexplicably works. Nicolas Cage Jon Turteltaub and Jerry Bruckheimer discovered the secret of alchemy with the first movie three years ago turning mediocre action spiced with American lore into box-office gold and the same is likely to hold for the second chapter in their history text. ""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" is another romp through the past that flits from one disjointed action sequence to another gussying it all up with crowd-pleasing morsels of fact and rivers of crazy legends that turn out to be true. Knuckle-headed as the movies are in historical context they sure know how to reel in great casts. Joining Academy Award winners Cage and Jon Voight and fellow ""Treasure"" veteran Harvey Keitel is Helen Mirren fresh off her Oscar win for ""The Queen"" along with Ed Harris. The last time Cages history buff and puzzle solver Ben Gates swiped the Declaration of Independence and used a treasure map hidden on its parchment to uncover a vast hidden fortune. This time he and dad Patrick (Voight) are stung by an accusation that an ancestor was a conspirator with John Wilkes Booth in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The claim is backed by a long-missing page from Booths diary produced by Mitch Wilkinson (Harris) a man with an ax to grind about his own family legacy. True to action formula producer Bruckheimer director Turteltaub and screenwriters Cormac and Marianne Wibberly feel compelled to start Ben out as estranged from the girlfriend with whom he ended the first movie archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). Thats so they can have those cute love-hate moments of blossoming romance all over again as they inevitably reteam to fetch clues and piece together the mystery. Advertise Advertise Advertise Voight is given his own estrangement to deal with in Bens mom Emily (Mirren) an authority in American Indian languages who has not spoken to her hubby in 32 years. But it turns out the Gates boys need her expertise as the trail eventually leads them to myths of a lost city of gold the Indians left behind. Also back is Justin Bartha as Ben and Abigails tech-geek partner Riley and Keitel as the FBI guy again forced to try to bring Ben in. Even the president of the United States (Bruce Greenwood) is drawn into the quest Bens mission forcing him to sneak a peek at a fabled book of secrets to which only Oval Office occupants are privy. Quiet and unassuming as it is amid the big stunts and car chases a little adventure Cage and Greenwood share is one of the movies most-satisfying scenes. Greenwood who played John F. Kennedy in ""Thirteen Days"" has the aura of a president -- or at least the aura wed like our presidents to project. You almost wish the movie would take its cue from ""Air Force One"" and let the commander in chief lead the action rather than Cage.

Every on-screen drink in Mad Men in 5 minutes See the Dancing stars most memorable moves Emmys biggest snubs? Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom The movie does have a decent dose of droll humor which perfectly suits Cage. ""My girlfriend kicked me out Im living with my dad and my family killed President Lincoln"" Cages Ben laments early on. Harris role is crafted with more inner conflict and nobility than most bad guys and he brings a nice air of melancholy to the character. It seems like a waste to have Mirren in a role that almost any 60-something actress could play but she and Voight do manage some moments of humor. As with the first movie ""Book of Secrets"" leaps around like a choppy travel documentary Ben going overseas this time to find clues in Paris and London and again solving seemingly incomprehensible riddles with ridiculous flashes of insight. The film closes with the tease of a third chapter in the franchise some mystery in the presidents book that could send Ben and his pals on another treasure hunt. Theyve only worked their way through four score and seven years of American intrigue with the first two flicks so theres plenty of U.S. history left in which to muck about.

And whys multiple Oscar nominee Ed Harris snarling like a silent-screen baddie? How about debonair Bruce Greenwood skulking through a cave? And whats with Harvey Keitel as a G-man cartoonishly exclaiming ""the Presidents been what?"" Theyre all here in the service of Nicolas Cage himself an Academy Award-winning thespian who in the guise of gallivanting historian Ben Gates tears around Washington and Paris Buckingham Palace and Mount Rushmore in search of a lost city of gold. Yes its National Treasure Book of Secrets sequel to 2004s surprise blockbuster (350 million in global receipts) and its a thumping gabby slog. Signaling the tedium to come the movie starts in a lecture hall with a riveting Power Point display and the discovery of missing pages from the diary of Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth. Sadly for Gates and his dad (Voigt) the pages seem to implicate a Gates ancestor as one of Booths coconspirators. But father and son believe the diary points to something else altogether codes and puzzles that lead to a legendary American Indian treasure. And so theyre off to clear the family name and unearth a trove. Theres much more to the plot a secret book shared by U.S. presidents; a covert alliance between Queen Victoria and a Confederate general during the Civil War; twin 19th-century desks with missing planks; the Statue(s) of Liberty (the one in Paris is key) and on and on. Directed as its predecessor was by Jon Turteltaub National Treasure Book of Secrets is like a grade-school version of an Indiana Jones adventure. The fact that Disney has attached a Goofy cartoon short to the thing pretty much speaks to the demographic group the studio is expecting to attract and so the level of discourse is set accordingly low. Also along for the ride (and the paycheck) is icy Euro beauty Diane Kruger who returns as the fashionably attired D.C. archivist Abigail Chase. For the very few folks who saw the actress last year opposite Ed Harris in Copying Beethoven theres a small moment of amusement to be had as the two share scenes together here illustrating the peculiar vagaries of a Hollywood career.

There is an actual book of secrets buried in ""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" and its not nearly as musty as the script. Graced with some extra star wattage courtesy of Helen Mirren and Ed Harris this diminishing-returns sequel sends Nicolas Cage on another quest to strike it rich get young auds excited about history and solve puzzles that are generally less stimulating than yesterdays Sudoku. The 2004 original grossed a surprising 347 million worldwide; with little change to the formula and even more marketing muscle Disney and producer Jerry Bruckheimer should see their B.O. and homevid coffers flooded anew. The first ""National Treasure"" was not without its charms -- namely an endearingly geeky obsession with clues and codes and a polite aversion to the explosive violence typical of most Bruckheimer-produced actioners. This time around however the riddles are conspicuously less clever the humor more obvious the stabs at educational value even more perfunctory. Sorry but having a character tearfully marvel at how the discovery of an ancient city of gold will revolutionize the study of pre-Columbian artifacts doesnt qualify as deep engagement with history. Opening flashback to President Lincolns assassination on April 14 1865 establishes the heroic legacy of Thomas Gates (Joel Gretsch) who was murdered that same evening by a shadowy society of Confederate treasure-hunters. Back in the present day one Mitch Wilkinson (Harris) so dastardly he speaks with a Southern accent comes forth with evidence that Gates actually masterminded Lincolns killing. Its up to professional nerd Ben Gates (Cage) and dad Patrick (Jon Voight) to clear their ancestors name -- and find the missing gold. Along the way the Gateses must endure tiresome comic relief (Justin Bartha back as tech whiz Riley) and reconcile with their estranged exes -- Ben with blonde bombshell/documents expert Abigail (Diane Kruger) and Patrick with Bens short-tempered mom Emily (a plucky Mirren) a professor conveniently well-versed in Native American languages. Soon theyre trotting the globe tearing up cities in high-speed car chases ransacking national landmarks for hints and exploring subterranean caverns like the stars of a poor mans ""Bourne Ultimatum"" ""Indiana Jones"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"" all rolled into one. The characters here dont just solve ciphers; they are ciphers their dialogue and emotional interactions no less mechanical than all the secret switches and hidden compartments (left for them to discover by long-deceased puzzlemeisters who clearly had too much time on their hands). Sole exception is Bruce Greenwood exuding his usual gravitas as a fictive U.S. president -- an honorable figure who typifies the films fuzzy nostalgia for simpler more patriotic times. With producer-director Jon Turteltaub back at the helm (pics five exec producers include original story creators Oren Aviv and Charles Segars) tech package is OK with flat functional lensing and nicely underplayed visual effects.

Ive been in theme-park haunted houses with much scarier lighting but the moment works because Bruce Greenwood who has played the president once before (in the monumental Thirteen Days) twinkles with the pleasure of high command especially when he tells Ben about the Presidents Secret Book. Its a compendium of privileged data -- including everything from the missing 18 1?2 minutes of Watergate tape to the truth about the Apollo moon missions -- that gets passed from each chief executive to the next. Ben figures that the book might be of help since hes trying to prove that his great-great-grandfather was a Civil War hero and not in fact the man who masterminded a conspiracy to kill Abraham Lincoln. Ben like the movie never actually questions the existence of such a plot; he simply wants to clear his relatives name. From the shadow associates of John Wilkes Booth to a hidden pact between Queen Victoria and the Confederacy Book of Secrets might best be called a crock of intrigue. Like the first National Treasure (2004) its a Styrofoam-cave cliff-hanger posing as a scavenger hunt all dressed up as a Da Vinci Code version of U.S. history. Yet this film does have a bit more spunk and drive than the first. Director Jon Turteltaub has fun with Indian glyphs giant stone pulleys and an Indy Jones-worthy City of Gold located beneath the rocky shoals of Mount Rushmore. Cage trying to be light looks about as gaunt as a Tim Burton ghoul but hes got a great bit paging through the book of secrets and skipping the part about the JFK assassination because they dont have time. Jon Voight as Bens father and Helen Mirren as his linguist mom are touchingly embattled. The movie is about as nourishing as a bowl of trail mix but its hard to stop eating. Whats next for National Treasure -- the Teapot Dome scandal? Los Alamos? The mind boggles as history trembles.

December 21 2007 Save for later Saved New in theaters The Kite Runner (PG-13)Director Marc Forster. With Shaun Toub Khalid Abdalla. (122 min.)Based on the best-selling English-language novel by the Afghan-American writer Khaled Hosseini ""The Kite Runner"" is about a well-to-do Afghan boy Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) who betrays his best friend Hassan (the marvelous Ahamd Khan Mahmoodzada) the son of the family servant and only as an adult achieves redemption. The films scope is epic taking in Afghanistan during both the Soviet invasion and the Taliban eras but Marc Forsters direction is often underpowered and the bland scenes with the mature Amir (Khalid Abdalla) in America do not contrast well with the childhood ones in Afghanistan. None of this may matter much in the end since this is one of those stories that on some primal level goes straight to the heart. Be aware that the film features a child rape scene. Grade B - Peter Rainer Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? National Treasure Book of Secrets (PG) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Director Jon Turtletaub. With Nicolas Cage Helen Mirren Jon Voight. (124 min.)This second Jerry Bruckheimer ""National Treasure"" adventure feebly directed by Jon Turtletaub is no better than the first - which means it will probably be creamed by critics and make a jillion dollars. But really standards are standards. Nicolas Cage returns as treasure hunter - excuse me treasure protector - Ben Gates along with Jon Voight as Bens semidoddering dad. It seems the lost pages from John Wilkes Booths diary have turned up and they implicate Bens ancestor Thomas Gates as a coconspirator in the Lincoln assassination. But since we know from the opening flashback scene that Thomas is innocent theres no suspense and in general the plotting is so diffuse that we are never allowed to puzzle out anything for ourselves. Helen Mirren has an amusing cameo as Bens mom. Grade C - P.R.

National Treasure gave us Nicolas Cage smart guy (the glasses are a dead giveaway) in the role of Benjamin Franklin Gates. In that film he had to steal the Declaration of Independence because according to family lore it held a clue that would lead to the riches of the Knights Templar. Check. In this film he has to figure out whether a recently discovered page from John Wilkes Booths secret diary is genuine. If it is it casts a horrible light on Gates entire family. Yep thats right. Once again this time its personal. Its also warmed-over mishmash with Gates dad Patrick (Jon Voight) again on hand though hes not much help because hes too upset by the revelations in the diary. Also back are Diane Kruger as Abigail Chase Ben Gates would-be girlfriend; Harvey Keitel as an FBI agent; and best of all Justin Bartha as Riley Poole Gates wisecracking goofball assistant. Same stuff different movie. This time the money-grubbing bad guy is played by Ed Harris. And someone talked the great Helen Mirren into playing Emily Appleton Bens mother. Maybe producer Jerry Bruckheimer backed up a dump truck full of cash to her driveway. (Thats a scene that wouldnt be out of place in the movie come to think of it.) Lets not kid anyone here. This franchise is all about dumb fun. And if theres more emphasis on the dumb part of the equation than the fun its not likely to stop audiences from flocking to this film. Its too loud not to be noticed. Gates crisscrosses the globe breaking into Buckingham Palace as well as the Oval Office (note that the movie is called National Treasure not National Security); commits a crime so preposterous you have to admire the movie after a fashion for even trying it; and winds up with a climactic action sequence that also serves as a dopey family reunion somewhere beneath Mount Rushmore. Along the way Gates drops a few historical nuggets on the audience. Best of the bunch The queens not in Buckingham Palace because its flag isnt flying. Good to know. As for the actual plot well good luck with that. After seeing the movie its still not clear just what was supposed to be going on what was proved true what wasnt. Not that it matters. To say the journey is the reward is probably giving National Treasure Book of Secrets too much credit. But its definitely true that whatever fun the film contains is found in the getting there.
