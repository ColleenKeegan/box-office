The Wrestler (R) 1/2 | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The Wrestler (R) 1/2 Mickeys back with a no-holds-barred winner. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald You have to wait a little while to get a good look at Mickey Rourkes face in The Wrestler. For the movies first few minutes director Darren Aronofsky keeps his camera mostly behind and to the side of the actor playing the washed-up pro wrestler Randy The Ram Robinson as he signs autographs for a pair of fans catches his breath after his latest match goes home to discover his trailer has been padlocked by his landlord for late rent and ends up spending the night inside his ramshackle van. When you finally get to really see Rourkes face the result is a bit startling. Rourke hasnt exactly disappeared from the public eye -- hes been acting steadily in films for the past 10 years -- but his puffy lumpy mug in The Wrestler still takes a little getting used to. He doesnt just look like 100 miles of hard road He looks like hes been paving it too. Thats part of what makes Rourke the perfect choice to play The Ram. Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream The Fountain) persevered to cast the actor despite the advice of everyone in Hollywood for a reason The Wrestler is one of those pictures where the lines between performer and character are intentionally blurred for dramatic gain. Watching Rourke as The Ram with his garishly bleached mane artificial tan steroid-pumped physique and ineffably sad wounded eyes you dont have to squint too hard to see the parallels between the two men. This is the fictional story of a wrestling superstar who long removed from his heyday in the 1980s is struggling to eke out a simple existence dealing with a body crumbling from the abuses of the past and consumed by loneliness having alienated everyone who was once dear to him including his resentful daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). The script written by Robert D. Siegel is replete with potentially corny cliches including a stripper with a heart of gold (played by Marisa Tomei with her usual strength and poise) the closest thing The Ram has to a romantic relationship. The Ram also has been told by his doctor that if he enters the ring again he risks a fatal heart attack. Befitting a picture about grown men in tights smacking each other around subtlety plays a small role here. But Aronofsky leaving behind the high cinematic style of his previous films in favor of a straightforward near-documentary approach plays each of the storys turns (including its more improbable ones) with complete earnestness counting on the sympathy Rourke earns from the audience to carry the film. The Wrestler presents a fascinating peek at the workings of the pro wrestling industry (the tenderness and humor the athletes share backstage is the complete opposite of the ferocity they display in the ring). It is also at times breathtakingly graphic in its depiction of the lengths wrestlers will go to entertain the audience (the staple-gun match stands out as particularly vicious). Mostly though The Wrestler is Rourkes show and the movie reminds you just how engaging he can be whether with a comical sequence in which The Ram tries to make a go at working behind a deli counter serving obnoxious patrons or a heartbreaking scene in which we watch him playing a wrestling video game on an ancient Nintendo with a kid who lives down the street momentarily lost in the memories of his golden past. Its a wonderful career-reviving performance and you cant imagine the movie without him. Welcome back Mickey.

His shoulders are enormous and slumped. His armor a tanned backplate of swollen muscles is capped with a helmet of bleach-blonde hair. On his legs spandex. In his bloodstream steroids. Thats our first peek at Mickey Rourke as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson an old pro wrestler wringing the last drops of fame from his career. Back in the day he was huge -- huge like Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard (""I am big. Its the pictures that got small"") only Norma never vanquished her co-stars with a rope-diving number called the ""Ram Jam."" Twenty years after his mythic showdown with the Ayatollah (Ernest Miller) Randys still out there getting hurled across the ring in school gyms and community centers around New Jersey. But the work is expensive and the pay runs cheap. To cover the rent -- or not -- he hauls boxes at a supermarket but that barely makes a dent in the high cost of body-building tanning sessions salon appointments illicit pharmaceuticals and occasional lap dances from Cassidy a stripper with a heart of gold (the very sad and very naked Marisa Tomei). He has hardly any friends. His grown daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) loathes him. He lives in a trailer and hes behind in his rent. So when he gets an invite to a 20th anniversary rematch with the Ayatollah the Ram welcomes this final crack at the big time ""This could be my ticket back to the top."" Then a massive heart attack interrupts his plans forcing him to pull back and reassess his life. Pain hope and one phenomenal hunk of acting result. Look Mickey Rourke never ""disappeared."" Best remembered for his breakout in Diner and his slinky magnetism in the films that followed (Nine1/2Weeks Wild Orchid) he made some noise in the early 1990s about the innate girliness of the acting profession and retired for a time to the boxing ring. In recent years his beat-up pugilists face and scratchy baritone have added an extra kink of danger to character parts (Domino Sin City) where hes been popping up like someones disturbed but still-weirdly-sexy ex-boyfriend. So no he didnt actually go anywhere. But has he come back or what? Thank Darren Aronofsky whose fourth feature (after Pi Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain) continues his holy quest into the far reaches of identity and obsession mysticism and death. But here hes working with a bare-bones linear story neither convoluted nor stylistically brash. Whats more hes possessed by Martin Scorsese Honesty and grit suffuse every shot whether the cameras following Randy through the belly of a supermarket (a la Goodfellas) or capturing in dispassionate closeups the real blood spilled in fake wrestling matches (a la Raging Bull). Watch for the razor; wince at the staple gun. In an early scene Cassidy compares The Passion of The Christ -- a Mel Gibson movie but Scorsese made his own film about the cross -- to Randys frequent scourgings. He observes that Jesus must have been a ""tough dude."" She then calls the wrestler a ""sacrificial Ram"" one in a series of biblical touches that turn weightier as the film winds on. Shot from below Randys arms spread wide even the Ram Jam looks cruciform. Written by Robert Siegel (the former editor-in-chief of satirical rag the Onion) The Wrestler unfolds about how youd expect. From a turning point just past mid-way anyone paying any sort of attention will know how the whole thing ends. But predictable as it is this sad strong beast of a film keeps us pinned to the mat with the strength of its compassion and the overpowering force of its central performance. And what a shocker it is. What a gutsy and vulnerable piece of work from one of American cinemas most battle-worn and fascinating stars. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 3P Military Tactical Oxford 30L Backpack for 12 + free shipping Lighting amp; Ceiling Fans at Home Depot Up to 80% off + free...

Its a question of reliability can Aronofsky suppress the subversive tendencies which resulted in Pi and Requiem for a Dream and put together a commercially viable but artistically satisfying picture?Narratively The Wrestler is solid even unspectacular. It uses its central character - Mickey Rourkes ex-WWF champ Randy the Ram Robinson - as a baseline from which to explore a familiar tale of loss and renewal. Writer Robert D Siegel takes the obvious option at most turns - throwing in an estranged kid here a stripper girlfriend there. Its lucky then that The Wrestler gets everything else right.  Aronofsky directs with unfussy candour alternating between the intensity of the wrestling and the drabness of Randys real life. His biggest contribution is to stand aside and let Rourke go to work the embodiment of the middle-aged comeback kid it would have been easy for Rourke to play the Ram as a version of himself. But while the role is loaded Rourke never coasts delivering a committed sympathetic portrait of a humble man cornered by bad decisions.Perhaps because its his voice we hear over the closing credits The Wrestler has been likened to Springsteen both employ familiar even old- fashioned elements but both manage to spin them into something meaningful through sheer quality of craftsmanship and emotional investment in the material. That this material is a little stale disappoints but this is rendered irrelevant by Aronofskys direction and Rourkes performance.

"Movie review The Wrestler -- 4 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review The Wrestler -- 4 out of 5 stars Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Mickey Rourke has earned that face. Every mile of hard living every bar fight delusional boxing match and botched plastic surgery is there a badge of hubris if not courage.But maybe hes earned The Wrestler too. As the aged pro grappler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson Rourke has the weariness the memories of glory days behind those eyes. The promise the actor showed decades ago is born anew. It doesnt hurt that now he has the mug of a man hit by a few too many folding chairs which is exactly what this terrific film by Darren Aronofsky requires. ""The Ram"" is well into his 50s working in a supermarket in the armpit of New Jersey sleeping in his van when he cant make the rent on his battered trailer-home.But weekends The Ram still dreams. He still shoots up with steroids still takes the abuse suffers the bruises and cuts (some self-inflicted for effect) for the paying customers at this American Legion hall or that fourth-rate gym. A low-rent promoter dangles a carrot -- a rematch of what was 20 years ago The Rams finest hour facing down The Ayatollah. Will his heart and his body hold out until then? The Ram has a sensitive side that makes him beloved by the younger wrestlers and the neighborhood kids. But hes lonely. He hasnt seen his daughter in years and shes all thats left of his family. The only adult he can talk to about his fading hopes is a stripper Cassidy ( Marisa Tomei). And far from being ""the stripper with a heart of gold"" Cassidy always makes him pay.The Wrestler is a surprisingly mainstream film from the arty Aronofsky (The Fountain Requiem for a Dream) a movie with predictable pathos. All The Ram wants to do is form an impromptu family with his angry estranged daughter ( Evan Rachel Wood) and maybe a stripper girlfriend. But its so sharply observed you may not mind. Rourke and Tomei give their scenes a kind of awkward tenderness that is both real and brittle. She quotes The Passion of the Christ and sees parallels in the abuse heaped on the Nazarene and what The Ram can absorb. That Jesus The Ram marvels was ""one tough dude.""The filmmaker takes us into the dressing room where the guys plan the nights bout hiding slivers of razor blades that they can use to cut themselves for a crowd that wants blood. And he drags us into the ring for the sado-masochistic horrors of a ""performance"" with the ""Necrobutcher"" a blood-sport specialist who willingly endures (and delivers) staples barbed wire and broken glass creating mayhem only a team of paramedics can clean up.But its the indignities of age that sting the most two people who have used and abused their bodies trying to come to grips with the end of careers with a little humanity. The chance to play that poignant confusion is the real prize that Rourke and Tomei earn in The Wrestler.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Pummeled. Smashed. Hammered. Pro-wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinsons face invites a slew of adjectives describing the way of all flesh reshaped by force years and a pharmacopia of substances meant to keep one sharp or hard or numbed. One of the finest pictures of the year ""The Wrestler"" directed by headstrong Darren Aronofsky played as a special presentation at the 31st Starz Denver Film Festival in November. Having already opened in New York and Los Angeles for award consideration it begins today at the Mayan. Its good to have some distance from the crowd of Christmas Day releases because Mickey Rourkes turn as the bruised battered Ram is worth savoring. Back in 1989 the Ram was a star. He even had his own action figure. Twenty years later he sits on a folding chair in a dressing room in the sort of makeshift venues this low-lying professional wrestling circuit travels. Playing a man whose job description requires a physical fortitude that has waned but whos possessed of the will to go on Rourke rattles and touches core sympathies. So too does Marisa Tomei as Cassidy the stripper Randy flirts lovingly with. Neither career path may reflect our own but the characters vulnerabilities are profoundly recognizable. An aging wrestler and a stripper working and connecting in New Jersey It sounds like the sort of down-and-out set-up indie filmmakers love to exploit. In different hands it might have been a freak-show jaunt. Instead Aronofsky (""Requiem for a Dream"" ""The Fountain"") has made a work of laser observation and spectacular compassion. ""The Wrestler"" stands as an exemplar of exquisite understated humanism. ""The Wrestler"" has the intimacy of a fly-on-the-wall documentary. No stunt men were harmed -- or used -- in the fight sequences. But the drama makes for vibrant art. Like its protagonist it will endure. Rachel Evan Wood plays the other woman in Randys life estranged daughter Stephanie. Facing mortality seemingly for the first time Randy seeks to reconnect. Wood captures her characters rough teeter between mistrust and want. On a ramshackle boardwalk weather hanging heavy Randy confesses his sins as a father. The camera searches his face. Challenged by doubters about his desire to cast Rourke Aronofsky reportedly told them ""When he looks into your eyes he breaks your heart."" Hes right. No longer fit for his job what will Randy do? A stint at the deli counter of a supermarket proves interesting. ""Understated"" is a strange word to use about a movie that has scenes of bodily harm likely to have the squeamish looking away. There are steroid injections. There is oozing blood. There is a staple gun. Cinematographer Maryse Albertis fluid shots are beautiful and visceral. Bodies at rest and motion -- in the ring in the strip club -- get their due. The devastation the Ram and his cohort invite and deliver in the ring was even harder to watch the second time. Aronofsky seems aware of this possibility when he shows the lead-up to the movies most grueling bout. First he shows Randy and his very polite foe agreeing on some choreography and rules. Then he cuts to the aftermath. Knowing the fights prologue and epilogue doesnt make the section labeled ""14 minutes ago"" any less wince-inducing. The screenplay never winks about the characters lives. Yet the filmmakers finds achy humor in the wrestling-circuit camaraderie. They also uncover a brute of a metrosexual in Randy as he hits the tanning salon and the hair stylist. Robert Siegel has crafted a tough- and-tender script. (Next week the former ""Onion"" editor has his directorial debut when ""The Big Fan"" about an obsessed Giants follower premieres at the Sundance Film Festival). Regret and a glimmer of possibility press against each other here. For a time that tussle seems more like the tense gripping and groping one sees in Greco-Roman wrestling than the body-slamming theatrics of pro wrestling. Often Aronofsky and lenswoman Alberti track Randy from behind. Its not a stalking shot though its often seen in horror flicks. We follow him like an angel like a manager like a trainer -- like someone who cares. So when the filmmakers break that spell it casts us in a different relationship. It may not be one we like. But its the one Randy needs it to be. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Wrestler"" is ""Rocky"" for an age of diminished expectations a heartfelt underdog story that hits you like an elbow smash in the ribs. Mickey Rourke finds his career-defining role as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson a has-been pro wrestler pushing his battered carcass through a few more bouts. Rourke 56 abandoned acting in the early 90s to take up boxing and now owns a face that looks like it kissed more than a few turnbuckles and a beefy body that moves like a walking collection of athletic injuries. Rourke not only has the physique to play the Ram but also the soul. His performance reminds you why he once was mentioned in the same breath with Brando. Before his wayward years he did bravura work in ""Diner"" ""Barfly"" ""Rumble Fish"" and ""Angel Heart."" Here he is after 15 years in the wilderness aiming to turn his career around with a display of real showmanship. No wonder he identifies with Randy. His acting is deep quiet and low-key an unostentatious merging of performer and part. Everything about Randy the Ram is crowd-pleasing make- believe including his name His birth certificate reads Robin Ramzinsky. Yet hes genuine where it counts. Hes a ""face"" the wrestling games term for the sportsmanlike hero of the match. He never hits his adversary with a folding chair unless provoked. Randy flopped as a professional entertainer (he was a national name in the 80s and now works days at a supermarket deli counter) and as a family man (he hasnt seen his grown daughter in years). Still hes an innocent. When the little boys in his trailer park coax him to come out and play he roughhouses like a 9-year-old. In the ring he delivers his all a sincere practitioner of a cheese-ball art form. Hes a steroid-bloated failure but his heart is true. His story is agreeably modest. The Ram wants to perform in a reunion match with his old nemesis the Ayatollah a pleasant Californian who now owns used-car dealerships. He wants to go on a date with Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) a stripper whose professional smile he mistakes for friendliness. And he wants to make amends with his grown-up little girl Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). On this simple scaffolding director Darren Aronofsky builds a remarkably touching and universal story. Almost every character gets a full measure of empathy. THE WRESTLER  out of 4 stars  Rating R for violence sexuality/nudity language and some drug use.  Theater Uptown. ""The Wrestler"" is strong confident filmmaking. It shows you everything you need to know and never whispers in your ear what youre supposed to feel about it. Consider Aronofskys hands-off style in his handling of an encounter between the Ram and a wrestling groupie. Their brief encounter threatens to sabotage Randys reformation. You can view the episode as an uproarious lewd joke a misstep by an immature lonely man or both. Rourkes clumsy flirtations with Tomei and his reconciliation with Wood at a derelict oceanside amusement park are achingly poignant. Aronofsky supports these moments with touches of subtle poetry. At the beach Randy tells his adult daughter ""Im an old broken-down piece of meat and I deserve to be alone. Just dont hate me."" Its a beautiful exchange all on its own but theres another subliminal layer at work. While he pours out his regrets the surf rhythmically marks their time together waves flowing until they break on the beach just as life flows until death. In ""The Wrestler"" Aronofsky has created a showpiece of dirty-fingernails realism -- Diane Arbus moments shot in grainy color. Maryse Albertis camera hovers close to Rourke as he paces backstage at wrestling events or walks the back hallways of the supermarket his energy penned in claustrophobic environments that he cant wait to escape. You can smell the stale sweat in the locker rooms the flat beer in the strip joint the salt spray at the shore. Robert Siegels script slices the ham thick but theres an aura of sincerity about the story that redeems it. The final image -- possibly the Rams return to glory maybe a devastating comedown -- ends the film on a note of sublime balance. Simply put its a knockout.

And hes right. In The Wrestler a rough and tumbling portrait of a washed-up pro wrestling star struggling to keep going 20 years past his prime Randys body - battered bandaged braced - doesnt look like itll even get him home to the trailer park never mind back into the ring. Beautifully directed by Darren Aronofsky from a screenplay by Robert Siegel The Wrestler in case you havent heard stars one Mickey Rourke in the title role. And if this ragged but near-brilliant movie is about a guy trying to resurrect his career so too is the performance at its heart. Wearing dyed blond tresses his hulking frame crosshatched with tattoos and scars his swollen mug virtually unrecognizable from the slick young hustler he played 25 years ago in The Pope of Greenwich Village Rourke works his way into the soul of ""The Ram"" as if he has known this character his entire life. He probably has. Its a haunting scary funny sad portrayal from Rourke an actor who like ""The Ram"" blazed through the 80s and then faded from view. (And did a stint on the professional boxing circuit too.) Im not sure if Rourke had to resort to selling autographs and posing for snapshots for a few bucks a pop at fan meets. But he did the Hollywood equivalent with the movies he showed up in the work he phoned in. The Wrestler isnt perfect. Aronofsky who launched his career with the black-and-white conundrum Pi has returned to his indie roots after messing with the Big Ideas and not-quite-big-enough budget of The Fountain. Shot verite style on the streets of North Jersey (and for the hard-core wrestling matches in South Phillys New Alhambra Arena) the film certainly wears its gritty authenticity well. But theres a certain (perhaps unavoidable) familiarity about its scenario; Rourkes buddy Sylvester Stallone banged out comparable plotlines in a bunch of Rockys and theres a whole subset of sports flicks that have deployed the aging underdog formula. And for all of Marisa Tomeis fearlessness as Cassidy a stripper who against her better judgment gets caught up in Randys personal life hers is the predictable and proverbial pole dancer-with-the-heart-of-gold role. On the other hand Evan Rachel Wood as Stephanie Robinson - college-age and long cut off from her deadbeat dad - shows hurt vulnerability and coiled-up rage as the daughter who wants her father to be there and almost believes him when he says that he can. The scenes with Rourke and Wood are especially resonant. Its no wonder Bruce Springsteen provided the title song for this hard-luck study of a worn-out dreamer Its the same terrain - the dive bars dollar stores faded beach towns - that the Boss has visited and revisited for as many decades as a guy like Randy has been traversing it. There are unforgettable moments in The Wrestler - which it should be warned does not flinch from displaying the brute bloody ugliness and bone-rattling choreographed violence of professional wrestling. (Lots of the supporting players in the ring and the locker room are real-life wrestling stars.) Aronofskys film offers up a glimmer of hope that Randy can make a new life for himself when he takes a job at the deli counter of a local supermarket joking with the customers lobbing foodstuffs aloft like a quarterback going long. Rourke makes you root for the guy - you want ""The Ram"" to get through it all to emerge victorious. Even though you know - and so does he - that the odds are close to impossible.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

The parallels to his character Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson are eerie. In the 80s Randy was selling out Madison Square Garden for his pro-wrestling matches; now he wrestles for chump change in church basements and the like. Rourke meanwhile made such films as Diner Rumble Fish The Pope of Greenwich Village and Barfly in the 80s. Then came a career skid which included a stint as a professional boxer and such movies as They Crawl. But Randy cant give up the life. Neither evidently can Rourke. When we meet Randy hes living in a trailer - living there that is when he can afford to pay the rent and his landlord unlocks the door. Hes a legend to the lowest-rung ""wrestlers"" he competes against and its entertaining to watch them orchestrate the various moves and throws theyll use in the ring. Still while he may be old and broken down - scenes of him putting in and taking out his hearing aid are oddly touching - at least Randy knows what hes doing in the ring. Its when he steps outside it that he runs into trouble. He works at a supermarket slicing meat in the deli and actually shows some aptitude for it at least for a time. His only real friend if you can call her that is Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) a stripper also on the downside of her career. Randy would like to get closer but Cassidy keeps a professional distance - as much distance as possible for someone who lap dances for a living that is. Randys relationship with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) is far more troublesome. He has obviously disappointed her time and again. She wants nothing to do with him but after he suffers a heart attack he feels the need to make amends. His body is a mess pumped up with steroids scarred by the tricks of the trade such as slicing his forehead with a hidden bit of razor blade; more blood equals more drama (director Darren Aronofsky shot with hand-held cameras for a gritty feel). His doctors instructions are simple Stop wrestling just as hes preparing for a (relatively) big match with his old foe the Ayatollah (Ernest Miller). Why not stop breathing? Wrestling is all Randy really knows as his repeated failures in every other aspect of his life prove. Hes the kind of person you want to root for. He keeps plugging away without complaint trying to make the most of his messy life. Cassidy at least recognizes boundaries or thinks she does. But is she really any more sure in her identity than Randy is in his? Its worth noting that Cassidy isnt her real name and Randy isnt his (its Robin much to his chagrin). Randy will of course try to come back one more time. Thats not surprising. The surprise is the speech he gives the audience before his bout about being welcomed back about redemption about continuing to strive long after most people have given up on you. Its then that actor and character life and role blend together. The Wrestler isnt a perfect movie - Randys outside-the-ring relationships arent as effective as his life inside it - but Rourkes performance gives it the impact of an atomic elbow drop.

Comments click to enlarge The Wrestler Recommended Watch on Amazon Rated R  105 minutes  2008 Whod have thought that Mickey Rourke a Hollywood punch line with a list of turkeys as long as your arm would come riding to the rescue of Darren Aronofsky the formidably arty director of Pi and Requiem for a Dream? Following the flop of his sci-fi fantasy The Fountain Aronofsky returns with this straightforward drama (2008) about a washed-up wrestling star (Rourke) whos still riding on the fumes of his 80s glory when a coronary forces him into retirement. The famously downbeat Aronofsky captures the grimy texture of life at the bummed-out bottom of the wrestling circuit but the center of the movie is Rourkes unimpeachable performance as a man who exults in self-punishment. He looks like a truck ran over him but at 52 hes still ripped enough to get away with the role; in the end the movie is about Rourkes indomitability more than the characters.

As washed-up onetime ring master Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson Rourke -- a career-crash victim himself -- is ""The Wrestler"" He embodies the same tragedy of ego that afflicts his character. He holds the same mirror up to his culture. This StoryThe Wrestler Down and Out on the EdgeThe WrestlerHoliday Movie Guide In other words as stunt casting goes ""The Wrestler"" cant be beat -- unlike Randy whose masochistic need to add the elusive second act to his life makes him a kind of societal piA+-ata-cum-throw pillow. Rourke drags Randys steroid-inflated corpus from battle to battle with the painful perseverance of Liza Minnelli and the weariness of a stop-lossed Marine. His hearing aid and reading glasses are arrows through his heart. Hes Mr. Entertainment nailed to a cross. ""The Wrestler"" is the fourth feature from Darren Aronofsky (""Requiem for a Dream"") and an anomalous exercise in spartan aesthetics for a director normally identified with high flights of style. But given that excess is the movies lifeblood -- the excesses of the ring of substance abuse of musculature even of tattoos and the couture of wrestling -- the only thing Aronofsky could temper was his own visual fancy. So he bit the bullet and the choice was good. But is it worth the time and money? Perhaps not if youre looking for a straightforward story that justifies its own existence. For those who appreciate the postmodern perversity of the construct however the film is a bounty of motivations allusions and even cultural history. ""The Wrestler"" exists on a transgressive fringe of Americana a realm occupied at one time or another by itinerant bluesmen vaudeville comics burlesque queens and frontier Hamlets i.e. ""theater people."" The grapplers perform their pumped-up battles anywhere from VFW posts to school auditoriums with a kind of noble if unknowing regard for the venerable traditions of the stage. The match must go on. Randy and his fellow performers -- some on their way up most on their way down -- behave collegially working out moves and falls and the various assaults-to-come as if the Christians were conspiring with the lions. As in most subcultural arenas ritual becomes codified Randys match-prep extends from sunbooth tanning to hair-dyeing to the careful concealment of a razor blade with which hell cut his own forehead after a supposed headbashing against a ring post. He ritually beats his forearms rather than his chest which is where the real trouble erupts Following what is probably the movies most gruesome sequence -- involving broken glass barbed wire and a staple gun -- Randy has a heart attack and his long slow denouement picks up reckless speed. As good as Rourke is and as willingly as he throws himself on the figurative hand grenade his performance constantly raises the question of whether the story would be worth telling without him. Marisa Tomei as Cassidy the pole dancer delivers a courageous performance one nearly as ego-battering as Rourkes. That Randy would be looking for love in a strip bar is perhaps ""The Wrestlers"" most poetic aspect. Both Randy and Cassidy practice their own forms of public nudity; both exist in fairly shadowy worlds that thrive on youth; both are aging out. Randys late-inning reunion with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) is poignant and somehow inevitable and a less rigid actress might have made more of it. But in the broader sense Randy is another in a long line of American screen characters -- be they gangsters gunslingers ballplayers or in this case fighters -- who are facing the inevitable and cant ease their regrets. We feel for him. And we feel for us. Maybe thats enough. The Wrestler (109 minutes at Landmarks Bethesda Row and AMC Loews Georgetown) is rated R for violence vulgarity drug use nudity and sexuality. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  The Wrestler Down and Out on the Edge Holiday Movie Guide The Wrestler",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/24/AR2008122402133.html,200,thewrestler13,thewrestler,washingtonpost

Photo Fox Searchlight 2008 Movie review Mickey Rourke is The Wrestler 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Wrestler Drama. Starring Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei. Directed by Darren Aronofsky. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Mickey Rourke in ""The Wrestler"" is one of the all-time exalted examples of an actor meeting a character and of each redeeming the other. The movie has the simplicity and confidence of a Johnny Cash song We recognize all the shopworn elements and yet the ballad still has the power to take audiences to a real emotional and philosophical place. To call ""The Wrestler"" a formula movie would be to misunderstand it. This is an homage to formula a knowing treatment thats loving rather than cynical. This is ritual and yet one that centers around someone weve never quite seen before a fake warrior - a down-on-his-luck wrestler - who has something truly heroic inside of him. In playing this role Rourke does something that actors rarely do He lets himself be seen completely. He puts his life and his body out there for inspection. Rourkes naked face with its destruction and equally painful-to-look-at reconstruction gives him a kind of monster/god power. He knows what he is and he gives us the audience the gift of himself with an ease thats more than ease with an equanimity thats partly his and partly the characters. This equanimity feels special and rather like spiritual grace. Director Darren Aronofsky and screenwriter Robert D. Siegel provide the setting for this performance and the result is some kind of true American poem. Take the scene in which the wrestler lies in his forlorn mobile home reading a paperback with his streaming hair pinned up in an offstage bun. The theatrically riveting detail in this still life is as poignant as anything movies can show you. You can feel the cold beauty of the scrubby East Coast woods surrounding the trailer park and though its just a trailer it feels like a mans home. Theres a glimpse of sky and kids play outside. This is not squalid just poor. ""The Wrestler"" presents life without talking down to it. Another wonderful scene The wrestler at his supermarket day job spends one afternoon working behind the deli counter. Hes embarrassed at first with his hair hidden behind a shower cap but his gentle nature and good humor surface and soon hes flirting playing with customers and trying to do a good job. The scene shifts from a semi-comical odd juxtaposition to a vision of unsung grace and one comes away thinking ""What a great soul"" - and thinking also about other great souls finding glory in hard or ridiculous places. The movie is full of particulars about the wrestling life the tanning sessions and the salon visits the steroids and the physical exertion that goes into these wrestling exhibitions. The fights may be fake but theyre nonetheless punishing. Theres blood and the exhaustion of pushing an aging body past its limit. In one scene the wrestler sits with other once-famous wrestlers at a barely attended autograph session signing VHS copies of his most famous match. Not DVD VHS. Thats perfect. And the video game made to commemorate that bout 20 years ago looks about as technologically sophisticated as Pac-Man. As the lap dancer the wrestler has been visiting for years Marisa Tomei takes what might have been a cliche and turns it into something complex and dignified. Underneath this dancers practiced exterior lies a world of sophisticated reactions thoughts and pains she has learned to keep to herself. This quality of mind comes through in Tomeis performance even when she is half naked. Tomei simply does not allow herself to be upstaged by her own nudity and thats a tribute to the actress investment and to the clarity and specificity of her acting. Tomeis exemplary work is a supporting performance in the truest sense. Shes an ideal partner for Rourke in some of the movie best scenes - the drinking-beer-in-the-afternoon scene is one of the years classics - and often our best glimpse of the wrestler is through her eyes. At first shes on the spot being asked to have a human response to a paying customer. Shes dismayed and resentful but soon she cant help being drawn to the wrestlers kindness. Thats the surprise of Rourkes performance the sheer kindness he brings to the role as well as the sense of hard-earned wisdom that accompanies it. Frankly its impossible to tell where the wrestler starts and Rourke leaves off but that doesnt matter. What matters is this If Rourke is in fact a rotten guy and is faking all the warmth and wisdom he shows in this film then hes a great actor and deserves all the accolades hes bound to receive. Conversely if hes not faking it if hes indeed a truly splendid fellow then hes still a great actor for being able to bare his essence so completely to the cameras scrutiny. (Try it its not easy.) Either way ""The Wrestler"" shows him to be great but if youre skeptical I dont blame you.

"The Wrestler This man is down - but not out | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Wrestler This man is down - but not outThey are sad seekers of truth in a sport notorious for fakery.By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Dec. 24 2008Starring Mickey Rourke Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. Directed by Darren Aronofsky. 109 minutes. At the Cumberland. 14A They are sad seekers of truth in a sport notorious for fakery.In the magnificent desolation that is Darren Aronofskys The Wrestler a huddle of professional grapplers 20 years past their 1980s prime sit behind tables at a sparsely attended fan event. They hope to make rent money by selling Polaroids autographs and videos attesting to their faded glory. More than this they want concrete affirmation that their lives have meaning long after the cheers have stilled. The unbearable looks of melancholy on their faces attest to how well sales are going. They are broken of body and spirit.Article Continued BelowBut one man in their midst Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) can still muster a wry smile. He knows hes just ""an old broken-down piece of meat"" and that his scars and creditors have him nearly pinned to the mat. He wants to go out fighting regardless at least for one final 20th-anniversary grudge rematch with a still-simmering rival. Maybe its because Randy wears a hearing aid but he doesnt seem to get it when people whisper of him as a ""loser"" and ""has-been."" You wonder when exactly he got that tattoo of a crucified Christ on his back.Rourkes Randy is the Dickensian focus of Aronofskys humane soulful and occasionally humorous portrait of life on the way down from the top. You dont have to be a wrestling fan to appreciate Randys dilemma He once enjoyed top-bill success and income as faded news clippings on his trailer wall show but now he plays for chump change on the nostalgia circuit. He play-acts in scripted fights using tinfoil weapons breakaway chairs and the occasional handymans appliance ""You okay with staples?"" a fellow combatant asks him. When the ""gate"" is low after a fight Randy is forced to sleep in his van because he cant afford his rent. Scripter Robert Siegel pulls no punches.Randys brutal passion has cost him his marriage estranged him from his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and taken a toll on his health. He still pumps his body full of steroids but now hes also addicted to painkillers for a chronic back problem. His heart tells him that hes living on borrowed time.His only comfort is a nightclub stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) whose interest in Randy may be purely professional. When he talks of love her eyes light up. Then she tells him that she cant get involved with clients saying ""The club and the real world they dont mix."" But then neither she nor Randy has ever really been part of the real world.""The only place I hurt"" Randy tells her ""is out there."" The film is a triumph on many levels not least of which is Rourkes return as an actor of reckoning. Its been about 20 years since Rourke appeared on anybodys A-list of Hollywood actors and he regains ground with an astonishing performance of grace heart and hard-won insights that demands Oscar attention.In their sterling supporting roles Tomei and Wood fully register the mixed emotions of women who have been hurt by men but who love them regardless.Also worthy of applause is Aronofskys return after the indecipherable astral indulgence that was The Fountain to the well-deep drama that Requiem for a Dream proved him capable of nearly a decade ago. Aronofskys strengths lie in people not in concepts.The Wrestler is suffused with sadness yet also the wonder of a spirit that refuses to be snuffed out and its a lesson to us all. Its so easy to hurl ""has-been"" when the skyrocket sputters so much harder to praise the long climb back.

"The Wrestler (3 1/2 stars) stars Mickey Rourke Marisa Tomei Evan Rachel Wood - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Wrestler (3 1/2 stars) stars Mickey Rourke Marisa Tomei Evan Rachel Wood Michael PhillipsTribune critic Written by Robert Siegel former editor of The Onion ""The Wrestler"" spends 105 minutes grappling at the edge of camp cheap laughs and cliches. Yet the way its handled by director Darren Aronofsky and especially by Mickey Rourke--who really should get an Oscar for his portrayal of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson a steroid-addled sweetie in tights--it stays honest and keeps on fighting.""The Wrestler"" works for the same reason ""Rachel Getting Married"" works. The way theyre acted shot edited and scored both films deploy a loose rough-hewn documentary style to great dramatic advantage. The corn isnt hyped. The performances click without going for the jugular. It is a pleasure to see Rourke finesse this amalgamation of ""The Champ"" ""Marty"" ""Rocky"" and a dozen other movies to his supreme advantage. Aronofsky directs so that we notice and appreciate his discretion even when hes showing Rourke pulling staple-gun staples out of his hide after a particularly rough bout in the ring. For several minutes we do not see Rourkes face. First hes sitting in the corner of a grade school classroom his back to the camera. This is how low The Ram has fallen since his stardom in the 80s Hes reduced to wrestling in a makeshift arena set up in a grade school and waiting in his ""dressing room"" for a percentage of the gate.For much of ""The Wrestler"" the camera follows Randy from behind like an eager autograph hound as he approaches each new combat arena or as he pounds on the door of his mobile home court managers office. The others on this B-minus wrestling circuit have names such as The Funky Samoan or Lex Lethal. The Ram is well-liked by all. His life is one of routines and routine disappointments along with diversions. He wears a cumbersome hearing aid hangs out with his stripper pal Cassidy ( Marisa Tomei) and for the purposes of the plot tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter ( Evan Rachel Wood). The Ram has heart problems but ""The Wrestler"" does not. Its sincere violent sentimental predictable and extremely effective. Rourkes a remarkable physical specimen every which way and he takes some amazing punishment amazingly choreographed in the wrestling scenes. He takes punishment in the more hackneyed off-ring scenes with his daughter too but Wood and Rourke treat the material like gold and damned if their scenes dont work. One of the best bits has Randy working the deli counter at his supermarket and the way he banters with the customers (""Whatcha havin good-lookin?"" Randy asks one shlubby middle-age fellow) you sense a born performer in action.Any number of directors and actors couldve messed up ""The Wrestler""--oversold its line of goods. Not Aronofsky and Rourke. They know in their bones this script is shameless. The trick is framing it as the right kind of shamelessness. Bruce Springsteen knows it too and his end-credits song no less on the nose than the rest of this savvy pungent little winner pays tribute to all the lonely entertainers out there working the crowds if there are crowds to be worked.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for violence sexuality/nudity language and some drug use).Running time 145.Opening Dec. 25.Starring Mickey Rourke (Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson); Marisa Tomei (Cassidy); Evan Rachel Wood (Stephanie).Directed by Darren Aronofsky; written by Robert Siegel; photographed by Maryse Alberti; edited by Andrew Weisblum; music by Clint Mansell; production design by Tim Grimes; produced by Scott Franklin and Aronofsky.

But Mickey Rourke delivers a powerful performance. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 20 2008 Save for later Saved Mickey Rourke is shown in a scene from The Wrestler. Rourke was nominated for a Golden Globe award for best actor in a motion picture drama on Thursday Dec. 11 2008. Fox Searchlight/Niko Tavernise/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In ""The Wrestler"" Mickey Rourke plays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson an over-the-hill grappler who has been locked out of his trailer home for nonpayment. To earn money he lugs cartons in a warehouse. Friendless estranged from his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) he frequents the local ""gentlemens club"" where an aging stripper (Marisa Tomei) eyeing his scars tells him he ought to see ""The Passion of the Christ."" Symbolism alert The Rams cuts are his stigmata. Can his resurrection be very far behind?""The Wrestler"" is a heavy dose of corn syrup. Director Darren Aronofskys herky-jerky hand-held camera stylistics have a veneer of verity but dont be fooled. This pastiche written by Robert Siegel is purest Hollywood. If youve never seen for starters the ""Rocky"" movies or ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" or ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" or ""Raging Bull"" you might be forgiven in thinking ""The Wrestler"" was an original. But for anyone with a memory for movies going back more than a decade its not so much a blast from the past as a whimper from the vault. Youve seen it all before - and better.Aronofsky doesnt introduce the Ram to us right away at least not headfirst. As in ""The Elephant Man"" the camera tracks behind him for a while until his face is revealed. And what a face. With his bruised mashed mug Rourke looks as if hes lived a life which may explain why the enthusiasts for this movie are making little distinction between the actor and the role. Rourke once quit the movies to become a boxer and has been out of the acting limelight for some time now. In ""The Wrestler"" the Ram stages a 20th-anniversary rematch with a celebrated opponent and similarly Rourkes reentry into leading-man roles is being greeted as his very own personal comeback. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? I would much rather have seen a movie about the devastations of the real Mickey Rourke. By comparison the Ram seems like a stand-in - a screenwriters pseudo-hard-boiled concoction. Dont let the films scruffy working-class trappings fool you. The movie has highfalutin pretensions starting with its title. It is not you will notice ""A Wrestler"" but ""The Wrestler"" for all that important mythic effect. The Ram bears the weight of all our coulda-been-a-contenda dreams. He takes the hit for all us dreamers too afraid to get into the ring of life. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Wrestler The steroid-pumped Ram still has the vestiges of a fine physique though and a long leonine mane of dyed blond hair. His wrestling matches are choreographed but draw real blood. The fights may be fake but the battles are real.The Rams mumbly speech is supposed to be more ""authentic"" than the articulateness of people unschooled in hard knocks. The filmmakers stumblebum-as-common-man routine is vintage Depression-era trope. Stallone was the first to re-up it for ""Rocky."" Given the current state of our economy its not surprising that it would rear its battered head again. The stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold trope is also an old standby. So is the scene with the Ram and his daughter wandering a deserted seaside boardwalk in Jersey.Rourke may have had a blasted career in the wake of his stupendous early work in films such as ""Diner"" and ""Body Heat"" but hes often been marvelous even in small roles. Back in 2001 as the distraught father of a murdered girl in ""The Pledge"" he had only one scene but he cut through the proceedings like an acetylene torch. Hes powerful in ""The Wrestler"" too but hes pushing his ravaged and ruinous look and theres something unseemly about that. Ill stand up and cheer when Rourke plays Henry Higgins in a remake of ""My Fair Lady."" Grade B-. (Rated R for violence sexuality/nudity language and some drug use.)

After decades of giving and taking punishment in a sport that isnt a sport hes got a split bicep a cracked clavicle a deaf ear wrecked knees and assorted other body parts that hurt as he puts it wryly only when he breathes. On top of that he hates himself with merciless passion. Its almost another miracle then that the director Darren Aronofsky and the writer Robert D. Siegel have turned the story of this washed-up faux gladiator into a film of authentic beauty and commanding consequence. ENLARGE Mickey Rourke is shown in a scene from The Wrestler. Associated Press/Fox Searchlight Certain scenes are hard to watch since the truth of pro wrestling is more complicated than mere fakery. The matches are staged to be sure with stagecraft that can involve appallingly elaborate torture rituals. Yet much of the suffering is real as ""The Wrestler"" demonstrates graphically; its consensual torture with such sado-masochist tools as barbed wire broken glass forks and staple guns. So avert your gaze if you must from time to time but not for too long because Mickey Rourke a gifted actor whos had his own massive career problems is suddenly back in full force with a phenomenal performance that takes pain as a starting point and quickly transcends it. Something of the same can be said of the director. His mysterious debut feature ""Pi"" announced the arrival of a singular talent and the promise was confirmed by the brutal power of ""Requiem for a Dream."" Then came ""The Fountain"" a turgid fantasy about eternal life that might have knocked a lesser talent out of the movie business for the career equivalent of eternity. Happily Mr. Aronofsky is back in the ranks of the bankable. ""The Wrestler"" is an imposing entertainment on several counts not the least of them being the scruffy milieu in which the much-diminished Ram grabs occasional matches and signs autographs for fans with long memories. (Maryse Alberti did the high-contrast high-impact cinematography.) For a while the film shapes up as a fairy-tale variation on the theme of ""Rocky."" Randy hopes to revisit his glory days of the late 1980s when he was a superstar on the professional circuit by getting into good enough shape to restage a classic battle with one of his best-known adversaries. Marisa Tomei gives a wonderfully nuanced and affecting performance as Cassidy a stripper whos almost at the end of her own string. (I do wish she hadnt been stuck with a gratuitous speech that draws glib equivalence between the wrestlers suffering and ""The Passion of the Christ."") Evan Rachel Wood is Stephanie the estranged daughter Randy reaches out to as intimations of mortality grow ever louder in his battered head. As fairy tales go however this is a tough-minded one. Pain has become a part of Randys tortured psyche an addictive drug that he treats with other drugs. The ultimate subject of ""The Wrestler"" is personal destiny and whether it can be changed. Seven Pounds Until today the subject of ""Seven Pounds"" has been kept under wraps. A huge marketing push signaled only the imminent arrival of a Will Smith movie starring Will Smith with Will Smith in the main role. Now we know why. And now we know why the star has been looking so mournful in all those trailers display ads and billboards. His latest film is about nothing less than life and death sin and atonement and it takes the soggy cake for multiple layers of sentimentality topped by indigestible grandiosity. That doesnt mean its bound to flop. In a time of diminished star power Mr. Smith is one of the last superstars with a dependably huge following. Still theres been a steady increase in the self-importance quotient of his most recent hits including last years treacly fable ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and last summers bizarre and ponderous ""Hancock."" Moviegoers with more generous spirits than mine may well be stirred by the quasi-religious quotient of ""Seven Pounds"" which was directed by Gabriele Muccino from a screenplay by Grant Nieporte. But Mr. Smith keeps himself so shamelessly at the center of things and the camera dwells so worshipfully on his anguished face that he seems to be anointing himself as the sacred embodiment of his own sermon. The movie begins with his character Ben Thomas in extreme anguish. ""Theres been a suicide"" he tells a 911 operator. When she asks ""Whos the victim?"" he replies ""I am."" This apparently scrambled sequence of tenses can be explained but you wont find the explanation here. Laying out the plots logic such as it is would spoil the suspense such as it is. All I can tell you is that Ben is a man with a fateful mission that the mission requires him to make solemn judgments on the goodness quotient of several individuals that Rosario Dawson plays a woman of unquestionable goodness and that Ben turns the matchlessly lethal venom of a box jellyfish into an instrument of expiation. He keeps the jellyfish in a big tank filled with ordinary tap water which would ordinarily kill the little bugger in no time flat. But a man who makes a movie about life and death gets to make all the rules. Yes Man ENLARGE Jim Carrey in Yes Man. Warner Bros. It would be churlish to naysay ""Yes Man"" so I wont. Jim Carreys new comedy is enjoyable enough for what it is a clever idea developed by fits and starts. And once the premise is established -- rather laboriously -- it works up a head of steam that could pass albeit briefly for inspiration. Mr. Carrey is Carl Allen a junior loan officer who says no to just about everyone and everything. If senior loan officers had followed his example in recent years we might not be in the fix were in but Carls rejectionism springs less from any sense of the mortgage market than from the pain of a lost love. All of this changes as the title suggests when a New Age Elmer Gantry played broadly by Terence Stamp persuades him to embrace life by saying yes to everyone and everything. The possibilities of this comic scheme are endless though not necessarily comic. ""Yes Man"" doesnt come fully to life until Carl meets Allison a kooky free spirit played by Zooey Deschanel. Kookiness isnt necessarily comic either but Ms. Deschanels sexy subtlety and endearing reserve seem to set Mr. Carrey free. Yes is the only correct response to Carls encounter with a would-be suicide and to a trip he takes with Allison to Nebraska. For the rest its a definite maybe.

It wasnt his first feature film but it was the film in which he showed himself to be an exceptional young actor in the company of other exceptional young actors. Among them were Steve Guttenberg Daniel Stern Paul Reiser Kevin Bacon Tim Daly and Ellen Barkin.

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday December 16 2008 403 PM A former pro wrestler tries to stage one last comeback. With Mickey Rourke Marisa Tomei. Director Darren Aronofsky (149). R violence nudity sexuality language drug use. At the Sunshine. Can you think of a more appealing tale than one about an aging star reduced to ashes of his former self but determined to make good again? Were watching that story play out in real life right now as Mickey Rourkes unexpected rise has sparked well-earned Oscar buzz. Theres more than a little sentimentality involved in the enthusiastic embrace of a once-great actor most recently known for his apparent plastic surgery and pet Chihuahuas. But everybody loves a comeback and Rourke is poised on the edge of a big one. Director Darren Aronofsky deserves considerable credit for realizing that Rourke could turn Robert Siegels somewhat simplistic script into a touchingly modest character study. In ""The Wrestler""Rourke plays Randy ""The Ram""Robinson an Eighties icon used to filling huge stadiums. These days Randy wrestles in grimy gyms for middle-aged fans who move as slowly as he does. And when hes not taking a beating in the ring hes getting kicked around by life itself he cant pay the rent on his trailer his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) wants nothing to do with him and the stripper he likes (Marisa Tomei) cant commit to a relationship any longer than a lap dance. As for his soul-deadening side job at a garishly fluorescent supermarket the less said the better. Though Wood overdoes the shrill resentment both Rourke and Tomei bring a tender lived-in honesty to their sad roles. Rourke in particular taps into the hollow pride and deep loneliness thats left after the shimmer of celebrity fades away. The actors own career slide has the feel of a tragedy--if you watch ""Diner"" again youll find yourself stunned by how confident and beautiful he once was. Its clear he knows it too given how fully he embodies Randys quietly wrenching life. Of course all an arthritic wrestler can hope for is a fixed nostalgia match between someone just as broken down. Right now Rourke has the fantasy of a true Hollywood ending well within his sights.

"As fake as wrestling - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW As fake as wrestlingDespite Mickey Rourkes performance the tale doesnt ring true.December 17 2008|Kenneth Turan FILM CRITIC ""The Wrestler"" doesnt add up. Its constructed with great care around a lead performance that is everything it could possibly be but the picture itself is off-putting and disappointing. How can this be? That performance as all of Hollywood already knows is Mickey Rourkes affecting work as Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson a once great name in professional wrestling who has fallen on hard times reduced to bouts in school gymnasiums to pay the rent on his bleak trailer. As the blues lyric says if he didnt have bad luck he wouldnt have no luck at all. Rourke whos had his own very public bouts with career disintegration falls naturally into this role and makes it his own. The actor has said he hesitated to take it on ""because it was a little too close"" and that innate understanding of what his character is going through combined with Rourkes ability make this one of the performances of the year. Rourke brings just the right amount of faded charisma to Robinson a man whose face is so frozen he can only express emotion with his eyes. With his long curly golden hair his artificial tan steroid-enhanced musculature and bloated face the actor is not playing himself but rather a part powerfully informed by his past life.Initially at least the rest of ""The Wrestler"" feels like a good fit with Rourkes work. As written by Robert Siegel shot in verite style by Maryse Alberti and directed by Darren Aronofsky the film has captured the down-at-the-heels ambience of the lower rungs of professional wrestling a subculture that was into performance art well before the high culture world heard of it.Things start to fall apart when ""The Wrestlers"" determination to wallow in the pain of Robinsons bouts reveals itself. A certain amount of that is necessary but this film pushes well beyond that yearning for the excessive until it feels like Aronofsky and company are making a fetish of audience discomfort. When a wrestler is introduced whose trademark is using a staple gun on opponents it becomes clear that these scenes are not about realism they are about making us squirm for squirmings sake.The aftermath of that staple-gun bout leads Robinson to the knowledge that he may not be able to wrestle again. He starts to reassess his life and tries to establish emotional connection with the two people he is closest to. That turns out not to be such a good idea either for the Ram or the film.Despite years of estrangement Robinson seeks out daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) who is still carrying a major grudge from that mother of all movie resentments the missed birthday party. Everything about this reconciliation scenario from its anger to its tears is so hopelessly contrived and predictable you can tell whats going to happen next by looking at your watch.Robinson also pursues a more lasting relationship with one of his few non-wrestling contacts a veteran exotic dancer named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) who is his lap dancer of choice at a local club. Tomeis acting skill makes this a more interesting scenario than the father-daughter subplot but it is hampered by one too many scenes of Cassidys nude dancing that once again make ""The Wrestler"" exploitative just when it thinks its being honest.That weakness for overdoing things whenever possible that willingness to push too hard to ensure that the walls close in on the Ram good and proper is a flaw that plays out throughout the film.When for instance Robinson gets a job behind a deli counter a Samson forced to wear a hairnet nothing will do but that he meet the hands-down customer from hell and that he respond in the bloodiest most excessive way he can imagine.This cold schematic quality this determination to bludgeon the audience into correct emotional thinking was a feature of Aronofskys earlier films including ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""The Fountain"" and it is present here as well.While the director was essential in collaborating with Rourke to create that memorable performance it remains real work in an essentially fake film and there is nothing anyone can do about that.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--The WrestlerMPAA rating R for violence sexuality/nudity language and some drug useRunning time 1 hour and 45 minutesPlaying In limited release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDavid Shoemakers The Squared Circle looks at wrestlings...November 14 2013Fans and Fighters Say Professional Wrestling Is the Real...July 14 1988Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-wrestler17-2008dec17,0,2137524.story",200,thewrestler25,thewrestler,latimes

Hes whats left of an 80s pro-wrestling icon - markdown Rapunzel hair a face like a tenderized orange a voice box like a muffler being dragged down the turnpike. He lives in a trailer park in New Jersey and not one of the nicer ones. He is played with crumpled glory by the ghost of Mickey Rourke. Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (ne Robin Ramzinsky) has a tale of woe as pumped with cliche as the films hero is with steroids. His girl is a stripper (Marisa Tomei) his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) hates him his home is a trailer his ride a serial killers van. Hes got a bum ticker. What else? Oh he wants to pull it all together for a big rematch with his arch rival. Yet some voodoo of craftsmanship and purity - I cant decide whether its in Robert Siegels original script or Darren Aronofskys direction - makes ""The Wrestler"" as irresistible as a headlock. Its all been done a thousand times but seldom done well. Aronofsky previously an imagineer of aggressively weird pictures such as ""Pi"" and ""The Fountain"" proves a master of trailer-park realism - scuffed funny and human. For a movie whose element is lap dances at ""Cheeques"" and guys named ""Mr. Magnificent"" and ""the Funky Samoans"" ""The Wrestler"" is as precise with its details as a lyric poem. The fighting is brief but crucial. There are only about 12 minutes of ring action and as shoddy as it is it may make you see these turnbuckle clowns in a different light. How ""fake"" will your bruises be after you fall backwards off an 8-foot ladder onto a card table covered with barbed wire? When was the last time your pectoral muscles sustained an insult by staple gun? Compared to these guys boxers are as soft as Camembert. What the movie is really about is its people the kind of citizens who affix posters of singing groups to their walls (AC/DC for Randy; Vampire Weekend for his daughter). Its about the antediluvian video game that stars (and is still played by) the Ram and the spectators (meaty guys in football jerseys and gold chokers a fan with an artificial leg who begs Randy to club an opponent with it) who still attend Randys bouts. A slut in an animal-print jersey at a bar in Rahway wants to know if Randy likes to party - ""like a fireman party"" - and the meaning turns out to be perfectly clear if hilarious. Randy is human hair metal and hearing ""Round and Round"" in a bar with a pretty girl is as close to feeling good as hell ever get a flash of life ""before that Cobain p - - - y had to come along."" Another high point is a bit of random joy that comes when Randy accepts a job in a deli. Being a showman he works the crowd ""Whatcha havin good-lookin?"" he says to a little mole man whom he commands to drop back to catch a touchdown pass of egg salad. Id call this Rourkes Oscar scene except the whole movie is his Oscar scene. He dances with his daughter in a deserted ballroom by the boardwalk he winces as he slices open his own forehead in a fight he sits at a folding table in a nearly empty room trying to sell Polaroids of himself posing with fans for eight bucks. Rourke is a landfill of a man as brilliantly dismal as the Bruce Springsteen song (sure to win an Oscar) that closes the film. You cant cry because hes too funny and you cant laugh because hes too tragic. As for Tomei her street sweetness still purrs like a Trans Am but there is a problem with her playing a fading stripper her body. She shows us all but about three square centimeters of it and its in mint condition. Thanks in part to a cleverly ambiguous ending that allows you to walk away in whatever mood you like ""The Wrestler"" offers something to pretty much everyone in the audience. Much like ""The Sopranos"" it creates a world that might make you feel utterly at home or exhilarated by strange horrors. Maybe both. kyle.smithnypost.com THE WRESTLER Wins the belt.

WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY In The Wrestler (   out of four) Mickey Rourke wallops us with a damaged hero who is full of pathos and poignant contradictions. PREMIERE Actors pin performances on Wrestler A superstar in the 80s Rourkes Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson tries gamely to maintain his heavy metal/Viking image. But hes pushing 50. With his blond extensions and tanning-salon-enhanced visage the washed-up fighter struts and preens and amps up the staged bloody choreography before tiny audiences at his smattering of gigs. More often he sucks it up and goes to his day job at a grocery store his bleached locks encased in a hairnet. Outside the ring hes Robin (the given name he despises) spooning out pasta salad for indecisive old biddies. His innate charm helps him work the crowds in both places until overcome by humiliation he loses it in the supermarket. Rourke gives the performance of his life. Tough clueless and more self-aware than he lets on Randy is excruciatingly sad. When he describes himself as ""an old broken-down piece of meat"" your heart aches for him. Its not just his ego that has taken a beating. Randys body is busted too. His heart is dodgy he wears a hearing aid and needs reading glasses. But hes not going quietly into late middle age. Driving in his truck he continues to blare the heavy metal music of his glory days. Director Darren Aronofsky (The Fountain) has drawn an Oscar-caliber performance from Rourke and powerful portrayals from supporting players Evan Rachel Wood as Stephanie Randys estranged daughter and Marisa Tomei as Cassidy the stripper with a heart of something very close to gold. The story has its cliched and sentimental moments. Its no Raging Bull more like Rocky shot with a handheld camera. But Rourkes wounded tough guy is undeniably captivating. He smacks you in the gut and wrenches your heart. (Rated R for violence sexuality/nudity language some drug use. Running time 1 hour 49 minutes. Opens today in select cities.)

"The Wrestler reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Wrestler reviewed. The Wrestler reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 17 2008 1156 AM Unexpected Body Slam The Wrestler is terrific. By Dana Stevens The Wrestler Theres an extra thrill that comes from loving a movie you thought you were going to hate. Darren Aronofsky (Pi Requiem for a Dream The Fountain) is a director whose intellectual reach tends to exceed his artistic grasp. Though the scope of his ambition may be admirable-- The Fountain is about nothing less than Hugh Jackmans quest to transcend mortality--Aronofksys films have always struck me as adolescent fantasies self-consciously big ideas wrapped in lurid overcomposed images. So the scruffy almost accidental beauty of The Wrestler (Fox Searchlight) comes as even more of a surprise than the greatness of Mickey Rourkes performance. The idea that Rourke an 80s sex symbol coming off 20 years of Bukowski-esque dissolution had this in him makes a crazy sort of sense. That Aronofsky had it in him is a rebuke to the complacency of viewers who like me thought they had his number. Rourke plays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson a washed-up pro wrestler who works a day job at a supermarket while continuing to ply his trade on weekends in VA halls along the Jersey shore. Though hes lonely broke and living in a trailer (that is when the landlord doesnt lock him out for unpaid rent) the Ram seems to be getting by OK. He trades banter illegal substances and ass-whomping tips with his fellow wrestlers (all played marvelously by nonactors from the real-life circuit) and visits his favorite stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) for chatty lap dances. Then after a particularly grueling match with the staple-gun-wielding ""Necro Butcher"" (Dylan Summers) the Ram has a heart attack. Waking up in the hospital hes told he should never wrestle again. But a certain ""Ayatollah"" is looking to re-create a legendary 20-year-old match with the Ram and the flyers are already printed ... Advertisement Though Randy cant bring himself to stop doing the only thing hes ever been a winner at he does make some changes in his life He tries to connect with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) who after years of neglect regards him with a distrust bordering on hatred. He also tentatively pushes for a real relationship with Cassidy but her resistance to the idea of dating a strip-club customer proves tougher than Necro Butchers stapler. Randys relationships with these two women are what set The Wrestler (sparely scripted by Robert Siegel) apart from your standard sports-comeback drama. Wood has definitively made the jump from interesting child star to accomplished adult actress. Though hers is the most underwritten of the three main characters she shines in her few scenes as the wounded rageful daughter. And amid all the (granted well-earned) fuss about Rourkes comeback I hope Marisa Tomei wont be overlooked for what I consider the single best female performance of the year supporting or otherwise. Shes smart earthy and astonishingly real in a role that could have foundered in cheap sentimentality. And if were going to marvel at Rourkes sculpted (and no doubt hormonally augmented) 56-year-old form how about Tomeis 44-year-old body pole-dancing in a G-string? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I cant think of any movie since North Dallas Forty that looks so unflinchingly at the masochism of professional sports. The Rams brand of wrestling is frankly fake but no less lethal for that. His body pumped up by steroids and parched by years of hard living is a barely functioning wreck aptly assessed by its owner as ""an old broken-down piece of meat."" The movie also exposes some wrestling tricks like the razor blade that Randy hides in his wristband to furtively self-inflict wounds during a match. Though the wrestling scenes have a no-holds-barred intensity--Randy and his opponents come at each other with everything from barbed wire to a fans prosthetic leg--they dont feel voyeuristic or condescending. Leaping from the top rope in lime-green tights may be medically unadvisable and existentially absurd but its what the Ram does. Its his art. After a second viewing Im hard-pressed to find a moment in this strangely delicate movie that doesnt play true. Maryse Albertis handheld camera takes us exactly where we need to be (usually following Rourke around) without drawing attention to its own mobility. The well-placed music--a Guns N Roses song here a Springsteen ballad there--feels indigenous to the New Jersey working-class locale. And Rourke holds the whole thing together with a rich dense performance devoid of vanity or shtick. The Ram is sometimes--often even--a manipulative self-pitying man but Rourke and Aronofskypaint his portrait with a rigorous dignity.

"Wrestler The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wrestler-the ) Wrestler The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli The film with the loudest buzz at the 2008 Toronto Film Festival was Darren Aranofskys The Wrestler - quite a change for the man who brought The Fountain to the same venues a couple of years ago to almost universal indifference. The Wrestler on the other hand excited interest from all corners and just before its first screening it was announced that Fox Searchlight had purchased the North American distribution rights. Almost immediately the studios publicity department went into overdrive and for good reason. This is the kind of film that inevitably will excite awards talk - for Mickey Rourke (Best Actor) for Marisa Tomei (Best Supporting Actress) for Aronofsky (Best Director) and for the film (Best Picture). Its redemption for the filmmaker who has regained the ""critics darling"" label applied to him following his debut feature Pi and its forceful follow-up Requiem for a Dream. Rourke in what may be the defining performance of a rocky career that appeared to have hit rock bottom plays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson a one-time wrestling great who has been relegated by the rigors of declining health and advancing age to performing in small venues and doing autograph signings. Randy dreams of one day regaining his glory of 20 years ago but even a lyric from a song on his radio - ""Dont know what you got till its gone"" - tells a different story. When a heart attack fells Randy after a low-level bout the doctors advice is unequivocal give up wrestling or risk death. This compels Randy to re-assess things. Is life without wrestling - even what passes for ""wrestling"" at this stage of his career - any kind of life? He gets a job at the deli counter of a local supermarket makes attempts to re-connect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) and tries to start a relationship with a stripper (Marisa Tomei) with whom he is friendly. The strippers story parallels Randys. Both are past-their-prime performers who find their services in ever-decreasing demand. (Note Kudos to Aranofsky for showing a stripper who actually takes her clothing off and to Tomei for performing the requisite nudity. Coupled with her work in last years Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead Tomei has successfully shed a reputation for on-screen prudishness.) As character studies go this one is among the most powerful and compelling I have seen in some time. The film is meticulous in the ways it delves into Randys life and it does so with verisimilitude and a lack of melodrama. The film provides a cornucopia of fascinating information about the behind-the-scenes goings-on at professional wrestling matches - how the violence may be choreographed but is often real. If this doesnt reflect what really happens it is presented in such a way that its completely believable. But this is icing on the cake. The meat of the story reflects Randys attempts to cope with what he has become and the delusions that keep him going. His honest but flawed attempts to regain a place in his daughters life are pathetic and heartbreaking. He has hurt her in ways we can only begin to imagine but in one touching scene we see that there is hope - at least for a flickering fading instant. The Wrestler is like that a mixture of hope and despair for someone that time has forgotten and deigns not to remember. Aronofskys directorial style is simple and spare. There are no flourishes or attempts to convince us that he is a master of his craft. The straightforward approach works best recalling a documentary without mimicking it. At many times the perspective is that of a ""fly on the wall."" Were with Randy in his trailer or in the prep room before a match or in the ring. The immediacy is almost unsettling at times. Mickey Rourke who has been flying under the radar for nearly two decades makes this a comeback to remember. Admittedly Rourke has never quit acting. In fact his filmography shows more than 30 credits since his heyday in the late 80s and early90s. With some notable exceptions (Sin City for example) most of those have not been roles to brag about. Randy is Rourkes first fully three-dimensional individual in a long time afflicted not only with the foibles common to human beings but the better impulses as well. He is in many ways a sad case - a man whose entire identity and self-worth are defined by the sport that has ruined his health and cast him aside. He lives in a trailer park in Northern New Jersey and cant make the rent. His daughter despises him. He lives for the adulation of those few fans who still remember him. Rourke does not play Randy as someone who craves pity; he holds his head high and rolls with the punches (both literally and figuratively) even when they leave him broken and bleeding. Its not hard to understand why The Wrestler is getting so many plaudits from across the critical landscape. Even coming out as it is in the mid-December crowd of would-be Oscar contenders it distinguishes itself. For Aronofsky its easy to forgive The Fountain if this is what comes from the hard lessons he learned following that minor misfire. Whether The Wrestler wins any awards is beside the point - the fact that its worthy of them is all that should matter to movie-goers who care about connecting with a unique and complex screen protagonist.

Hoberman Mickey Rourke and Darren Aronofsky Both Make Visceral Comebacks in The Wrestler Wednesday December 17 2008 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Niko Tavernise A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The Wrestler may be plenty visceral but its no more a sports movie than professional wrestling is a competitive sport. Chronic over-reacher Darren Aronofskys relatively unpretentious follow-up to the ridiculous debacle that was The Fountain is all about showbiz. Its also a canny example. You want to make a comeback saga you get a washed-up star--in this case Mickey Rourke for whom as Scott Foundas reported in a Voice cover story Aronofsky and screenwriter Robert Siegel conceived the movie.The old ""new De Niro"" of the Reagan era and a famous flame-out well before Bill Clinton took office the volatile Rourke gives a career performance as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson--an amiably broken-down wrestler who was himself a star of the 1980s. A ravaged steroid hulk with a stringy blond mane and a head full of Motley Crue the Ram is actually something of a sweetie who enjoys playing Nintendo with the neighborhood kids. Rourke is scarcely more recognizable as this over-the-hill palooka than as the hulking cyber-enhanced mutant shtarke he played in Sin City but theres still the shadow of his soft-lipped baby-face smile.Present in every scene if not each shot Rourke gives a tremendously physical performance that The Wrestler essentially exists to document. The movie has a deliberately cruddy lurid look; set entirely in Nowhere New Jersey it could have been shot by the Dardenne brothers. The camera hastens after the Ram scampers backs as he advances or perches on the hood of his car as he drives through the night. Aronofsky dotes on the details of the Rams routine (securing meds getting a perm visiting the tanning parlor) especially his preparations for a bout. A true professional Randy carefully works out a routine with his adversary concealing razors with which to cut himself and share some blood with his fans.Rourke too is a pro and The Wrestler which won the Gold Lion at Venice and closed the New York Film Festival has its share of action. The most gruesome bout is one in which a younger more degenerate fighter--cast as a villainous ""heel"" rather than a sympathetic ""face""--introduces the Ram to the strategic use of a staple gun. The crowd loves it appreciatively chanting ""You sick fuck"" when Randys opponent staples a 20 bill to his forehead. Its this bloody mess 20 minutes into the movie that triggers the Rams heart attack landing him in the hospital with a doctors warning that its past time he retired.It seems likely that the Harvard-educated Aronofsky would know Roland Barthess essay on the semiotics of wrestling which among other things discusses this ""spectacle of excess"" as a dramatic ritual of suffering and humiliation ""It is as if the wrestler is crucified in broad daylight and in the sight of all."" In any case The Wrestlers vivid concern with the mortification of the flesh is given a spiritual dimension by a veteran stripper who goes by the nom de pole Cassidy (Marisa Tomei Hollywoods go-to gal for an Oscar-quality lap-dance).Cassidys sleazy workplace is the female equivalent of the Rams blood-slimed wrestling arena. Hoping to cheer up her favorite customer Cassidy advises him to see The Passion of the Christ ""Its amazing. They throw everything at him--rocks stones arrows"" (""Tough dude"" the wrestler mumbles missing Cassidys joke that he is the Sacrificial Ram.) A touching scene in which these two cartoon gladiators meet after-hours on a Saturday afternoon wearing their normal outfits is topped only by the day in which the Ram tries to go straight taking a job at the deli counter in a neighborhood supermarket. He even seems to be enjoying himself. But however you slice it its all about the meat and the attempt ends with a debacle worthy of his ""Ram Jam"" ring antics.Not nearly as successful is the Rams attempted reconciliation with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). Rourkes character may be larger than the movie but this time the Ram gets ground up in the mechanics of the plot. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

The nature of the drug is different in every movie swirling and fractured in Pi transcendentally romantic in The Fountain. In his new film The Wrestler he induces a state of masochistic ecstasythe oneness with the universe that comes from being pummeled and cut and watching ones blood fly onto the canvas. The tragic hero is Randy the Ram Robinson (Mickey Rourke) an aging pro-wrestler once a star with nothing real in his life but that Artaudian Theater of Cruelty in which men in mythically garish costumes perform brutal ballets before shrieking crowds. Beside Aronofskys bouts the ones in Raging Bull seem like Japanese tea ceremonies. No matter how choreographed the pounding is ferocious and we see the world through Randys swimming perceptions. Even cringing we feel his joy. He secretes a small razor in his costume and down for the count slices open his face to make the gore even splashier. We rise with him in triumph I bleed therefore I am. The movie isnt as world-shattering as those bouts Its a regretful-old-warrior weeper in which Gods loneliest man attempts to reconcile with the bitter child (Evan Rachel Wood) he abandoned and reaches out to the only woman who shows him affectiona stripper (the ever-comely Marisa Tomei) who has the grace not to let him see her eyes wander in search of other lap-dance customers. We know that even if he touches the strippers heart and breaks through his daughters anger hell screw it up because after all hes only good for one thing in life even if it kills him. Allusions to Christ are everywhere; the stripper talks about the carnage in The Passion of the Christ. Is Aronofsky being tongue in cheek? I dont think hes ever tongue in cheek.This is a case where an actor makes the difference. Mickey Rourke was once among our most charismatic leading men alert wittily self-contained (he always seemed to be smiling at a private joke) with a high but seductive voice. Whatever the hell he did to himself it worked for Sin City in which the makeup for his monster-man avenger Marv brought out the freakish poetry in his distended physiognomy. In The Wrestler his face has that poetry without the makeup. Rourke has long blond hair that makes him look like a battered lion and his tight swollen mask makes Randys struggle to bare his soul even more momentous. Its dumb its outlandish but smashing other peoples heads and getting his own smashed back really does complete him. -- David Edelstein Related Stories Featured In Mickey Rourke Wrestles the Undulating Curve of Shifting Expectations (10/13/08) Is Mickey Rourke the Next Marlon Brando?

Siegel; Release Date Limited 12/17/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures Posted December 10 2008 -- 1200 AM EST Certain movies about losers have a special desperately moving appeal. By showing us men whose lives have fallen dramatically short of their dreams they speak to -- and for -- all of us. Darren Aronofsky?s The Wrestler with Mickey Rourke as a broken-down professional wrestling star still clinging to his glory days from the 1980s could touch a chord in audiences the way On the Waterfront and Rocky did. It has that kind of lyrical humanity. Aronofsky doesnt speak a sentimental cinematic language. Shooting in a grainy bare-bones naturalistic style full of jump cuts and raw light and a handheld camera whooshing about the director of Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain now strips away all frills tapping a classic Hollywood myth -- a has-been looking for redemption -- and at the same time transcending that myth. The Wrestler is like Rocky made by the Scorsese of Mean Streets. Its the rare movie fairy tale thats also a bravura work of art. Back in the pumped-up heavy metal 80s Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was a big deal a golden-god gladiator with his own action figure and videogame. His Madison Square Garden bout with a wrestler known as the Ayatollah was seen by a million and a half people on pay per view. But that was then. Now 20 years later Randy is a wreck on painkillers with pulverized bones a hearing aid and a face thats been mashed so many times it resembles a wad of dirty Silly Putty. But he still wrestles before small crowds in VFW halls eating up the bluster of the adoration which is mostly nostalgia for the bluster of two decades before. Thats something Mickey Rourke must know a lot about. As a young star he was a bow-lipped bad boy who wooed women on screen with his soft voice and twinkly knowing smile. Now its not just his look that has changed; he seems stunted -- all muscle and scar tissue a figure of damaged loss. Miraculously though the softness remains. In The Wrestler Rourke is at once an authentic former wrestling superstar a Heres How They Look Now tabloid curiosity and -- more than ever -- a great actor. With platinum hair down to his back hes like some bloated freakazoid Sammy Hagar and he makes you feel every crunched bone and pained breath the way that Randy subjects his body to punishment to remind himself hes alive. Aronofsky plays off Rourkes fallen-icon status by feasting on that spectacular pulped wreck of a face. Yet from within that mountain of wounded flesh Rourke gives Randy a deep slow voice of disarming gentleness. Randy is the soul of decency encased in a monsters physique with a buried sadness that pushed far enough explodes into rage. The movie burns through the fakery of wrestling in a touching way by letting us see how the trumped-up ""enemies"" in the ring actually love and support each other. And theyre not just sham warriors. Randy slices his forehead open with a fragment of razor to make sure hes putting on a bloody good show. In one gruesome bout he gets lacerated by barbed wire and a staple gun. Is such a scene needed? Lets just say it expresses the cutting edge of Randys pain-freak authenticity. When hes not in the ring Randy is basically a polite saddened middle-aged man who lives in a New Jersey trailer park and works part-time in a supermarket. Aronofsky working from a script by Robert Siegel brings us piercingly close to the life of a relic the visits to the tanning salon the courteous way that Randy treats even the people who make fun of him the two-decade-old fan paraphernalia he brings to a pathetically underattended ""legend signing."" We see how scared he is -- an insecure dude who never got over his given name Robin. Hes a loner almost completely isolated yet he tries to reconnect to life through two women Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) a stripper who has taken a liking to him (but still makes him pay for his lap dances) and Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) his furious estranged daughter who now wants nothing to do with him. The movie lets us see how Randy was a bad father whose selfishness has broken his own heart. Hes a man who has lost nearly everything. Yet he can still reach for grace Standing up on the ropes preparing to do his theatrical pounce he looks triumphant tearful and ready to enter heaven.

Siegel Directed by Darren Aronofsky Starring Mickey Rourke Marisa Tomei Evan Rachel Wood Talk about comebacks. In The Wrestler a post-Rocky look at a junked-out has-been fighter who wont leave the ring even though hes long past his prime Mickey Rourke rises from the dead to resuscitate not only his acting career but his personal self-respect as well. In interviews at film festivals in Toronto and Venice (where it won the top prize) the battered bloated and facially disfigured former boxer who made his first impact as a method actor in 1982s Diner and 1983s Rumble Fish before hitting the road to ruin talked about how The Wrestler has saved him from a self-destructive Hells Angels lifestyle of violence arrogance and cynicism that rendered him unemployable. Well its good to see an obviously gifted man once written off as a freak punch his way through a meaty role with the hunger of a starving lumberjack tearing into raw steak. Now he attends press dinners with pet Chihuahas tucked under his arm feeding them from his plate. Unlike James Dean Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando--pretty boys who declared war on their good looks with disastrous results--Mr. Rourke has lived to prove theres dough to be earned with those dewlaps. In The Wrestler he continues to beef up his body with steroids and suntans making no effort to conceal the decay. With his long dyed-blond locks and ravaged face he looks like a creepy cross between a crazy Gorgeous George and Charles Laughtons Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Darren Aronofsky an arty self-conscious director I have never cared for does his best work to date extracting from his star the edge pain and hetero-depravity within himself and Mr. Rourke realizing hes got nothing to lose wisely trusts the boss instincts. Its like he knows this is his last chance so hed better show the scars and all. From start to finish you are almost unable to believe this is acting. Like Jack Palance in Requiem for a Heavyweight the man youre watching not only has the role of a lifetime; he seems to be living it too. The result is the most brutally honest performance of the year. He plays Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson a washed-up pugilist who was once a draw on the fight circuit. But that was 20 years ago. Now hes lucky to eke out a living stacking shelves in a New Jersey supermarket warehouse fighting anybody in local gyms who will take him on for extra money and trying not to get killed before the bell. Hes partially deaf and cauliflower-eared with a face like a Halloween mask and the kind of long straw-yellow hair in a bun you see on aging waitresses and church organists; even his tattoos are faded. Living alone in a seedy trailer piercing his skin with staple guns smashing his head with metal garbage cans and folding chairs he lives in a bleak world devoid of all color except for his green spangled tights and hes totally alone in it. His estranged lesbian daughter (the exceptional ingenue Evan Rachel Wood) makes an occasional appearance as does a compassionate sometime girlfriend (another terrific performance by Marisa Tomei) but shes an aging stripper with a child to raise in Trenton N.J. and no time for romance. How sad is that? After recovering from a heart attack brought on by years of self-abuse he makes a touching attempt to retire but loneliness and social ineptitude force him back into the arena for the respect and applause that are missing from his empty life. Subjecting his body to epic slammings and energy-enhancing drugs he figures whatever happens its got to be better than the misery and rejection he gets in the outside world. Its a plot so familiar it borders on cliche and elements of everything from Champion to Million Dollar Baby are inescapable. But theres no denying Aronofskys commitment (gone are all traces of arty self-indulgence that have been his trademarks in junk like The Fountain); the tough script by Robert D. Siegel which never begs pity for its downbeat characters; and especially Mickey Rourkes raw naked passion which makes his galvanizing performance a real awards contender and provides a jump-start for a career with a dead transmission. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under Darren Aronofsky Evan Rachel Wood Marisa Tomei Mickey Rourke movie On the Town Trending Now Wikileaks Proves Primary Was Rigged DNC Undermined Democracy Politics Wikileaks Dismantling of DNC Is Clear Attack by Putin on Clinton Politics Why ISIS Sees an Elderly Priest as a Threat to the Caliphate Politics Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2008/o2/art-meet-life,200,thewrestler34,thewrestler,observer

By Anthony Lane Mickey Rourke as Randy (the Ram) Robinson in Darren Aronofskys movie.   Credit Illustration by Quickhoney For some years Mickey Rourke was just about my favorite movie star. This was not an easy stance to take. The body of the mans work was dismayingly thin and the body of good work from ""Rumble Fish"" onward could be counted on the knuckles of one fist. As for the body of the man it swelled from taut and slender to something so bulbous and spongiform that those of us who had thrilled to Boogie his cocky romancer in ""Diner"" could only wince and look away. Yet I insist there was a time when Rourke demanded to be looked at catching and holding your eye no less grippingly than the young De Niro. Sweetness and menace were folded up in him--in the way that he angled himself at the world as if both sure of his place within it and deeper down afraid that it might still spit him out. Hence the voice never a bellow or a screech nor yet a Brando-haunted mumble but the soft croon of a conspirator; remember him as the arsonist for hire in ""Body Heat"" forcing his employers to lean in close lest they miss his wicked meaning. That whisper of secrecy remained in Stanley White with his stiff gray hair his long coat and his vows of judicial vengeance. Stanley was the cop whom Rourke played in ""Year of the Dragon"" and everything about the project shouted overkill script by Oliver Stone direction by Michael Cimino and a racial attitude that was designed to rile. But there was Rourke holding steady at the core of the storm. And now the voice is back. In ""The Wrestler"" directed by Darren Aronofsky Rourke is Robin Ramzinski known to his admirers as Randy (the Ram) Robinson. The body is now a glistening mound of bruised and damaged goods and the quiff of Stanley White has been replaced by a mop of ropy blond extensions that you could wipe the floor with. Twenty years ago as the opening credits show Randy was a star on the wrestling circuit but the film follows him as he burns away. He lives in a trailer in New Jersey except that right now he doesnt; the landlord has locked him out for not paying the rent. Randy joshes with the local kids and plays Nintendo with one of them--""a really old game"" according to the boy who is used to Call of Duty. Such is modern senescence to age as quickly as a video game. Randy still wrestles but the cash is petty and he boosts his income by heaving boxes at a supermarket. He has a friend a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) but she has no plans to be his girlfriend. Then there is Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) his daughter although they havent met in years. When they do hook up things improve--too fast it turns out as if reconciliation were more of a dream than a practical goal. They book a dinner but Randy gets drunk misses the date and loses her once more. ""An old broken-down piece of meat"" he calls himself. ""Im alone and I deserve to be alone."" To some extent as that speech suggests ""The Wrestler"" is as simple as its title. The pathos of personal ruin is an established trope and the trick as demonstrated by John Huston in ""Fat City"" and by Martin Scorsese in ""Raging Bull"" is to stop it from sliding into the sentimental. Aronofsky doesnt always succeed in this and there are lines in Robert D. Siegels script that wave their symbolic purpose in the audiences face ""Its your heart--you need to start taking better care of it."" So says a hospital medic when Randy is admitted and undergoes bypass surgery after collapsing in the wake of a bout. Its O.K. Doc we get the point. But the movie like its hero manages to yank itself back into shape and that it strikes me is mostly due to Rourke. When Randy goes home after the operation and peels off his bandage the camera zooms in to inspect the scar on his chest whereas what really pinches our attention is his harmless habits the mild uncomplaining manner in which he pops in a hearing aid or adjusts his reading spectacles. He may be one of the last people in movies to use a pay phone. This fellow is mutton dressed as Ram and he knows it and if he earns the caress of our pity that is precisely because he never stoops to beg for it. There is no denying the brutality of ""The Wrestler"" and some of the scenes in the ring especially those which provoke the cardiac arrest are hard to watch. The movie comes off as inoffensive however since unusually for these times it trades in violence cleansed of ill will. The wrestlers are a club greeting one another as brothers in arms or in headlocks; one of them cheerfully sells Randy almost a thousand dollars worth of steroids and other drugs and in place of the hypocritical masking that bedevils major sports there is a peculiar honesty almost a decorum running beneath the overcooked beefcake and the staged aggression of the fights. ""What do you want to do tonight?"" one opponent asks Randy as if inviting him to the theatre before proposing that he enliven that evenings bout by puncturing his rival with a staple gun. You could call them cardboard characters pierced and flattened for the delight of the crowd but Aronofsky cast the minor roles with real wrestlers and you believe in every scourging of the flesh. For all that the best sequence in the film even more likely to lodge in your mind than the soaring sadness of the climax takes place not on the wrestlers canvas with its carpet of blood and broken glass but at the deli counter of the supermarket. Here Randy needing the money dons a protective hairnet and doles out pasta salad. He even pins on a name tag that says ""Robin"" randiness being too rich for this clientele. The dent to his pride is profound more wounding than any professional blow to the head and the scene closes in agony as he takes out his frustration on a meat slicer. But heres the thing while the job lasts hes pretty good at it bringing a brief shaft of pleasure to the customers and suffering any taunts that come his way. What Rourke offers us in short is not just a comeback performance but something much rarer a rounded raddled portrait of a good man. Suddenly there it is again--the charm the anxious modesty the never-distant hint of wrath the teen-age smiles and all the other virtues of a winner. No wonder people warmed to Randy Robinson twenty years ago. I felt the same about Mickey Rourke and I still do. For those who think of cinema as dramatic roughage ""The Reader"" should prove sufficiently indigestible. Directed by Stephen Daldry and adapted by David Hare from the novel by Bernhard Schlink it stars Kate Winslet as Hanna Schmitz a tram conductor in the German town of Neustadt. In 1958 she embarks on an affair with a fifteen-year-old schoolboy named Michael (David Kross). ""Look at me kid"" she says casually adopting the Humphrey Bogart position. They fall into the swing of a routine first he reads to her then they make love. In many ways the ideal existence. Time slouches on and in 1966 Michael now a law student sees Hanna again this time in a courtroom where she is being tried for her actions as an S.S. guard. He should be shocked by this revelation but Kross--who I regret to say is borderline bovine throughout--merely lowers his muzzle and pants a bit and Daldry himself seems to miss the moment as if he had spent too long chewing it over. The whole film in fact with its loping pace and plaintive score feels like a woefully polite not to say British take on a foreign horror; was there really no one from the fierce new wave of German filmmakers prepared to dramatize the Schlink? Or did they feel as I did that it was pernicious from the start--a low-grade musing on atrocity garnished with erotic titillation? Imprisoned for life Hanna must read to herself but are we really supposed to be moved by the thought--or now in Daldrys film by the sight--of an unrepentant Nazi parsing Chekhov? That is not culturally nourishing; it is morally famished. There is a fine scene near the end when a survivor of Hannas crimes (the great Lena Olin) tells the middle-aged Michael (Ralph Fiennes) that ""nothing came out of the camps"" that they ""werent therapy."" Quite true so why has the film pretended otherwise? Still ""The Reader"" is a triumph of bite and speed compared with ""Doubt."" This film written and directed by John Patrick Shanley who adapted it from his own play unfolds in 1964 at a Catholic school in the Bronx. A jovial priest Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is accused by the principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) of interfering with an altar boy. He denies it she yearns to believe it and we dont care. Collectors of large narrative signposts will spend a happy couple of hours at Shanleys movie enjoying the window-rattling thunderstorms that he uses to indicate spiritual crisis and the grimness with which Sister Aloysius narrowing her red-rimmed eyes delivers the line ""So its happened."" I didnt know you could hiss groan and murmur at the same time but Streep can do anything. She is of course wasted on this elephantine fable; if only ""Doubt"" had been made in 1964 shot by Roger Corman over a long weekend and retitled ""Spawn of the Devil Witch"" or ""Blood Wimple"" all would have been forgiven.

Is it possible to conceive of ""There Will Be Blood"" without Daniel Day-Lewis in the leading role? The miracle and mystery of perfect casting came to mind at the Toronto film festival as I sat alongside 580 enthralled viewers witnessing the resurrection of Mickey Rourke in Darren Aronofskys gritty deeply affecting ""The Wrestler."" To say this is a great comeback for an actor whose talent was exceeded only by his self-destructiveness is obvious. But this was a kind of harmonic convergence of player and part that happens once in a blue moon--the actor vanishing so completely inside a role that our sense of his ""real"" identity is permanently altered.Rourke plays Randy (the Ram) Robinson a Gorgeous George-type pro wrestler still mixing it up decades past his prime. He looks half human half Frankenstein monster his scarred steroid-pumped body roasted a golden brown in tanning booths and his mottled face swollen by years of abuse. The crowds in the third-rate arenas have thinned but he still lives for their roar of approval. He lives in terror of being a has-been and when he suffers a heart attack and collapses after a brutal bout his doctors tell him he must hang up his tights or die.Another actor could have played this wreck for easy pathos--a sad-sack giant in decline. Weve seen that act before. But Rourke underplaying beautifully gives him a tough tender humor that skirts the usual cliches of aging gladiators that go back beyond ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" all the way to Wallace Beery. Theres none of the actorish self-indulgence that taint of narcissism that sometimes marred Rourkes earlier performances. Its hard at times to even imagine this is the same guy who was the Hot New Thing in ""Diner"" and ""Rumble Fish"" his brooding intensity evoking the usual James Dean references or the lounge lizard who specialized in soft-core erotica (""9 1/2 Weeks"" and ""Wild Orchid""). Rourke macho man extraordinaire disparaged the acting life for its suggestion of ""femininity"" and took up a boxing career to shore up his self-esteem. He seems to have poured all those demons into this part and emerged with a new sense of himself as an actor. When screen acting is this pure and simple it doesnt look like acting at all. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week I saw ""The Wrestler"" the day after seeing another electrifying acting moment in Toronto--in a documentary that was about performance and the casting process. ""Every Little Step"" is a movie about the creation of Michael Bennetts musical ""A Chorus Line"" and it follows several aspiring actor/dancers as they audition for the 2006 Broadway revival of the show. A young Asian-American actor named Jason Tam walks into the rehearsal room to read for the part of Paul the gay chorus boy. And suddenly the movie were watching is transformed by a performance of such raw emotional honesty that it reduced the seasoned director of the revival to tears--and produced goose bumps throughout the audience in Toronto. He got the part on the spot. Here was the magic of perfect casting unfolding before our eyes when its right no thinking is involved--it hits you in the gut. Kind of like a Randy the Ram body blow.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Talk about comebacks. After many years in the wilderness and being considered MIA professionally Mickey Rourke just like the washed-up character he plays attempts a return to the big show in ""The Wrestler."" Not only does he pull it off but Rourke creates a galvanizing humorous deeply moving portrait that instantly takes its place among the great iconic screen performances. An elemental story simply and brilliantly told Darren Aronofskys fourth feature is a winner from every possible angle although it will require deft handling by a smart distributor to overcome public preconceptions about Rourke the subject matter and the nature of the film. Co-produced by Wild Bunch in France where Rourke has retained his most loyal following through thick and thin this is nonetheless an American picture through and through beginning with the way it strongly evokes the gritty working-class atmosphere of numerous 70s dramas. Spare but vital and with the increasingly arty mannerisms of Aronofskys previous work completely stripped away the film has the clarity and simplicity of a great Hemingway short story -- theres nothing extraneous the characters must face up to their limited options in life and the dialogue in Robert Siegels superior script is inflected with the poetry of the everyday. All the same for the first few minutes one could be excused for imagining the film was directed by Belgiums Dardenne brothers as ace lenser Maryse Albertis camera relentlessly follows around aging wrestler Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson (Rourke) from the back concentrating on his long dyed-blond hair and hulking body before fully revealing his mottled puffy face. This guy is 20 years past his prime but hes still in pretty good shape and aims to get back on top on the pro wrestling circuit. Ram seems to have always been a big fan favorite -- he is one of their own a fearless bruiser the white working stiffs can root for against the assorted freaks ethnic interlopers and outright villains in this macho cartoon universe. A beguiling early scene that firmly sets the movie on its tracks shows an events muscled participants all warmly easygoing and chummy with one another pairing up and discussing what moves theyll make in their matches. A similar later scene has one of the wrestlers offering Ram his choices from a laundry list of dubious-sounding pharmaceuticals. Apart from the momentary camaraderie of his ringmates however Ram is alone in life. At the outset hes also penniless locked out of his dismal trailer home until he can pay up. He works occasionally lugging cartons at a big-box store and his tough-guy posture is adored by small kids but hes got no friends and nothing to show for his strenuous efforts. From time to time he has a drink at a gentlemens club where he visits aging stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) whose days of using her body for her livelihood are similarly numbered. After getting a load of some of Rams battle scars Cassidy whose real name is Pam tells him he ought to see ""The Passion of the Christ."" ""They threw everything at him"" she says to which Ram guesses Jesus must have been a ""tough dude."" Ram must confront his mortality after the films second wrestling match a bout so gruesome and barbarous it will force some people to look away. Assessing his options while recovering Ram decides to gently step up his relationship with Pam as well as to try to reconnect with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) whom he hasnt seen in years. Both women have good reasons not to allow such a damaged man into their intimate lives but even their most tentative signals of openness give Ram reason to hope for a new chapter in his life. His encounters with them are sensitively written and acted with impressive insight and delicacy and Ram has one monologue in which he lays his feelings bare to Stephanie at a deserted old Jersey boardwalk -- ""I deserve to be alone"" he admits -- that is so great one wishes it were longer. After a stint at a deli counter that is the source of more good character humor Ram decides to unretire and fight in a 20th-anniversary rematch of one of his most legendary bouts ""Ram vs. Ayatollah."" Despite the hoopla the way it all plays out is as far from ""Rocky Balboa"" as one could get resulting in a climax that is exhilarating funny and moving. Shot in rough-and-ready handheld style pic atmospherically reeks of low-rent lodgings clubs American Legion halls shops and makeshift dressing rooms on the Eastern seaboard in winter (it locationed in New Jersey and Philadelphia). Stylistically its agile alert and most interested in whats going on in the characters faces. And that is a lot. Physically imposing at 57 with a face that bespeaks untold battering and alteration Rourke is simply staggering as Ram. The camera is rarely off him and one doesnt want it to be so entirely does he express the full life of this man with his every word and gesture. Rams life has been dominated by pain in all its forms but hes also devoted it to the one thing he loves and excels at so he asks for no sympathy; he may have regrets but no complaints. As vibrant -- and as naked -- as she was in last years ""Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead"" Tomei is in top emotionally forthright form as she charts a life passage similar to Rams if much less extreme. Once her character stops stonewalling her father and hears him out Wood provides a fine foil for Rourke in their turbulent scenes together. The many supporting thesps especially the wrestling world habitues are richly amusing and salt-of-the-earth.
