Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner anchor the swiftly plotted movie as the (mostly) calm-under-pressure parents of Alexander (newcomer Ed Oxenbould). The grown-ups are just trying to temper the storms that hit their six-person clan which also includes a baby a too-cool teen (Dylan Minnette) and an eager theater kid (Kerris Dorsey excellent). Whether its a diaperless tot succumbing to natures will a bratty girlfriend a disastrous drivers test or a calamitous job interview each extreme situation is handled with deft slapstick timing and surprisingly relatable humanity. Alexander is pleasantly devoid of the vulgarity and too-current pop culture references that are the default mode for many contemporary live-action kids pics and its earnest celebration of family gives the movie a comforting throwback vibe. Like the source material this is one terrible horrible no good very bad day that families just might find themselves revisiting often.

Theres probably no way to adapt it for the screen without undoing its wonderfully one-note premise. The new film directed by Miguel Arteta and written by Rob Lieber pays heed to the broad strokes of the original work while updating and expanding it for big-studio entertainment. Such attempts usually collapse in a smarm-cloud of competing demographic interests cheap gags and bloat; see pretty much every feature-length Dr. Seuss adaptation for examples. This minor miracle amazingly doesnt. Its funny fast and charming. ""My parents say theres no such thing as a bad day that its all just how you look at it"" young Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) tells us in the films opening voice-over as we watch his defeated family driving home in a busted-up doorless station wagon. Dad (Steve Carell) wears a half-burned pirate shirt; Alexanders sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) is vomitously ill; baby Trevor is covered in green paint; and brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) and Mom (Jennifer Garner) both sport thousand-yard stares. They walk into the house are startled by a monstrous mysterious roar and the film flashes back to the previous morning -- to when it was just Alexander having his bad day. Some of these early injustices are familiar from Viorsts story but most of them have been updated both for the digital era and for Alexanders slightly older age. He wakes up with gum in his hair; he gets a dismissive response from his precocious carpool crush Becky (Sidney Fullmer); the school prankster takes a picture of him Photoshops his head on bikini models and texts the images around the school; and his birthday party the next day is about to be overshadowed by a far more elaborate one thrown by his rival Philip Parker ""a really cool kid with a hot tub and ADHD."" Then however at midnight on his birthday Alexander blows out a candle on a cake and makes a wish that the rest of his family ""all knew what it felt like to have a terrible horrible no good very bad day."" And lo Liar Liar-like he gets his wish. (And also as in Liar Liar this hint of the supernatural is never explainedA -- which is very much a good thing.) This turns out to be a rather unfortunate day for everything to go breathtakingly wrong. Dad whos been unemployed for a few months has a crucial job interview lined up. Mom who works at a publishing company needs to oversee an important launch and reading planned for a hot new childrens book. Anthony is set to take his girlfriend Celia (Bella Thorne) to the prom and she has it on good authority that they will be crowned Duke and Duchess there -- provided the world doesnt spin out of control. Emily is playing Peter Pan in the school play. Director Arteta keeps the chaos building and moving with generous doses of slapstick (mild) humiliation comedy and (mostly inoffensive) potty humor. (There is one off-color moment mixed in there however involving the word penisA -- a rare and bizarre misstep in a movie thats otherwise quite sure-footed.) Little details of execution make a big difference I enjoyed the stupid way that Moms book launch got derailed; the film savvily keeps the big reveal of exactly whats gone wrong until just the right moment when it can have maximum impact. Also notable is how the family becomes closer as the catastrophes mount similar to the characters in Little Miss Sunshine. That seems like a no-brainer -- an obvious theme for a kids movie -- but youd be amazed how often this gets screwed up. Late in the film Dads work travails and Anthonys prom date both converge on a Japanese hibachi restaurant and the rest of the family tags along to keep watch over them and lend support from a distance; their unity is touching and never overdone. Even as you enjoy the wildly spinning madness you find yourself rooting for this family and for this slight sleek fun and warm-hearted film.

(AP Photo/Disney Dale Robinette) Having a bad day? Just be glad youre not Alexander By Calvin Wilson / calvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Calvin Wilson Oct 10 2014 (...) The Associated Press Steve Carell appears in a scene from the film "" Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day."" (AP Photo/Disney Dale Robinette) Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) is about to turn 12 and hes pretty excited about it. The occasion calls for a party and he hopes to take that opportunity to get better acquainted with a pretty classmate.Unfortunately Alexander has unexpected competition. Another boy who just happens to be far more popular is having a birthday party the same day. So the odds are good that just about nobody will show up at Alexanders gathering -- unless he can persuade his parents to make it spectacular.Problem is theyre a bit distracted. Alexanders unemployed dad Ben (Steve Carell) is content to keep the festivities modest. And his mom Kelly (Jennifer Garner) has her hands full at work. It doesnt help that Alexanders brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) is preoccupied with passing his drivers test. Or that his sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) is busy preparing for her starring role in a school production of ""Peter Pan.""Then theres baby brother Trevor (Elise and Zoey Vargas) whos mightily upset about the loss of his bumblebee pacifier.What none of them realize is that theyre in for a disastrous day that -- depending on how superstitious you are -- may or may not be Alexanders fault. Based on the childrens book by Judith Viorst the family comedy ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" has a knockabout charm and is frequently hilarious. The film also confirms that the Disney studio has made peace with modern times Some of the jokes are just this side of raunchy but probably nothing that the average American kid cant handle.Working from a script by Rob Lieber indie-turned-mainstream director Miguel Arteta (""Chuck and Buck"") keeps the action speeding along while eliciting spot-on performances. Carell is at his discombobulated best and Garner anchors the proceedings with aplomb. Dont worry about getting the title right at the box office. A simple ""Alexander"" should suffice.What ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 122  Content Rude humor including reckless behavior and language Tags Steve Carell Jennifer Garner Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-dispatch Alexander And The Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 10 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 10 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Miguel Arteta Written by Ron Lieber Starring Steve Carell Jennifer Garner Ed Oxenbould Dylan Minnette Kerris Dorsey Classification G Country USA Language English Proceeding from the reasonable premise that the only thing more constantly in need of maintenance and repair than a home is the family within it Miguel Artetas Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day puts the Coopers to the test by making their neglected 12-year-olds birthday wish - that everyone could have a day as awful as his - come true. Like most of us the Coopers - father Ben (Steve Carell) mom Kelly (Jennifer Garner) sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) and baby Trevor - are harried. Bens been surplused from his advertising job and spends his days playing Trevors ""Fommy"" (father mommy); Kellys struggling to hold on to her publishing gig; Emilys determined to launch an acting career in the school production of Peter Pan; and Anthonys prepping for his prom night with the school uber-hottie Celia (Bella Thorne). Meanwhile Alexanders life is prepubescently pear-shaped and nobodys got the time to notice. Ergo that birthday wish.In its scene-setting stages Artetas movie effectively gets us inside poor Alexanders head as a stubbornly uncooperative suburban universe conspires to make everything in his daily life an epic ordeal the destruction of the schools science lab - perpetrated in the name of impressing the unattainably cute crush object Becky (Sidney Fullmer) - being only the most catastrophic of events. Alexander narrates with a rueful put-upon worldly wisdom that instantly enlists our sympathy and the young actor Ed Oxenbould may be the most appealing junior loser weve seen since Peter Billingsley wished for an air rifle in A Christmas Story.But once that wish is made and the movie which is based on Judith Viorsts book shifts its attention to the havoc all the other Coopers endure over the course of the day a curious thing happens. Although much of the ensuing chaos is staged with a cumulative comic momentum that keeps all balls rolling and evokes a live-action cartoon Alexander is once again sidelined and left behind Even in his own movie hes largely left out of the loopiness.While that may put a damper on our emotional investment in the poor kid it doesnt prevent Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day from gathering its own comic momentum and depicting the harrowingly thin line between domestic stability and utter anarchy the very line so many of us tread from the instant the alarm clock calls us back to active duty. This is where the comedy comes from that lurking fear that even the most routine of daily domestic tasks is just a spilled coffee cup away from disaster.But where the movie finds its heart - and Alexander again - is in the family-friendly sentimental suggestion that anything can be endured and all disaster recovered from provided the core unit is solid and everybody loves one another enough. This is the lesson we take from Alexanders act of selfish cosmic retribution and its a heartwarmer to be sure. Even the boy himself stands to learn from it at least until he sees the movie and realizes hes been upstaged by his own kinfolk once again.

(Photo Dale Robinette Walt Disney Co. )Everybody has bad days. You push through them and usually -- hopefully -- things get better.That was the lesson of ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" Judith Viorsts 1972 childrens book. The film version uses Viorsts 32-page book and blows it up barely into an 80-minute movie. The same ground is covered and if the movie is a piffle its at least an enjoyable inoffensive one.Alexander (Ed Oxenbould whose real kid qualities are an asset) has a rough day one where nothing goes his way but he gets no sympathy from his family members who are all enjoying happy times. His stay-at-home father (Steve Carell) has just landed a big job interview his publisher mother (Jennifer Garner) has a best-seller on deck his sister (Kerris Dorsey) has the lead role in the school play and his brother (Dylan Minnette) is about to be named Prom King. On the eve of his 12th birthday Alexander makes a wish that they all would have as bad a day as he does. As these movies go he gets his wish.Nothing is so bad that it cant be undone. Theres a typo in moms book his sister gets a cold. ""Alexander"" plays things family-friendly bringing a comedic tone and a light touch. Alexander didnt really want his family members to suffer -- only for them to pay a little more attention to him. You wont be surprised to learn the film ends with hugs.From ""Chuck amp; Buck"" to ""Cedar Rapids"" director Miguel Arteta has spent his time toiling on small character-driven indie films.

"Review Alexanders day isnt so terrible film isnt so great - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Alexanders day isnt so terrible film isnt so great Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day Dale Robinette / Disney Steve Carell is the dad with a member of his brood in ""Alexander."" Steve Carell is the dad with a member of his brood in ""Alexander."" (Dale Robinette / Disney) Betsy Sharkey Review Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day doesnt rise to greatness Like so many family movies of the past ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" rests on the idea of the innocent and the unsuspecting caught in embarrassing but amusing situations. I believe its technically referred to as the shock-and-scream effect.All of the Coopers -- including the parents played by Jennifer Garner and Steve Carell and the baby -- get many shocks and deliver many screams. Some are in the style of the E.T.-Drew Barrymore closet confrontation; others are reminiscent of the ""Home Alone"" Macaulay Culkin scream. A few evoke Munchs ""The Scream"" though I dont think Edvard had humor in mind. The terrible horrible no-good very bad day in question like the movie itself is not so terribly horrible. Not so terribly terrific either. And at the moment modestly amusing does not stave off that desire for a really great live-action family film after years of watching the terrain land-grabbed by animation. A ""Wreck-It Ralph"" reference in ""Alexander"" lands yet another sucker punch unintended though it might be.Judith Viorsts beloved childrens book is wildly expanded and updated for the big screen -- cellphone gaffs abound. Indeed Rob Liebers script overflows with bad luck that begins when the about-to-turn-12 Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) wishes his family could experience his loser life for just one day. A cupcake a candle and a birthday wish in the wee hours of the morning set things in motion. No one escapes not his perfect older brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) not talented older sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey). Even baby Trevor doesnt get a pass. Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day trailer ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" trailer ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" trailer See more videos For most of the Cooper clan the day starts out promising. Ben (Carell) has a cool job interview with a hip video game developer. Kelly (Garner) is about to be named a vice president of her publishing company. Meanwhile Emilys nailed the lead in ""Peter Pan"" and Anthony is going to junior prom with his dream date Celia (Bella Thorne). Trevor (twins Elise and Zoey Vargas) is required only to look adorable and handles it perfectly. As Anthony says at breakfast ""Hash-tag blessed you know?"" Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day Dale Robinette / Disney Ed Oxenbould appears in a scene from the film "" Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day."" Ed Oxenbould appears in a scene from the film "" Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day."" (Dale Robinette / Disney) But soon enough the terrible horrible starts piling up. Like Emilys very bad cold... lame.Director Miguel Arteta is best known for a darker brand of subversive behavior like the comedy clash of Hollywood dreams and a family prostitution ring in his 1997 Independent Spirit award-nominated ""Star Maps."" But his most defining work thus far remains 2002s ""The Good Girl"" which gave Jennifer Aniston an excellent stage to do drama and disappointment at a time when she desperately needed some distance from sitcom Rachel and ""Friends."" Arteta sets a brisk pace for ""Alexander"" barely letting one disaster hit before another is underway. This is a Disney production so everything is bright and shiny and suburban without the blight. I swear there is nary a cloud to darken this very bad day. Its made even more vibrant by a crack crew which includes director of photographer Terry Stacey production designer Michael Corenblith and costume designer Nancy Steiner. An impossibly up-tempo beat courtesy of Christopher Beck is the cherry on top.But instead of all that polished precision helping ""Alexander"" the film quickly starts to feel more like the director is working through a to do list though Im sure with a smile.Dotting every ""i"" begins to steal some of the terrible horrible fun that might have been possible. Case in point Dick Van Dyke (an uncredited cameo) and the awkward misprint. His new childrens book the one Kellys in charge of has an unfortunate typo that turns an ordinary word into something slightly scatological. Disaster strikes at a reading packed with little ones and in the mishmash that follows Van Dykes silly signature antics dont have a chance.There are funny moments but most of them already made it into the trailer -- like the disastrous dinner at a Benihana-style restaurant. (Fire fish tanks a pirate shirt.)As it does in the fire-and-fish-tank incident Carells impeccable comic timing keeps most of his Ben bits afloat. Garners distressed motherly smiles and screams carry Kelly for a while. Dorsey Minnette and Thorne put in a good show. The Vargas twins remain as adorable as they were in ""Neighbors"" laughing smiling crying and chewing a green magic marker on cue.Now to Alexander. Making his big-screen debut Oxenbould is pretty adorable too -- comfortable on screen a winning smile an endearing hint of a lisp so even his imperfections are close to perfect. But for most of the day the young actor is asked to keep Alexander in a state of slightly apologetic guilt when you really do wish hed take a little more mischievous delight in the mishaps. I guess its only in the movies that wishes come true.Twitter BetseySharkey------------------------------------------Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad DayMPAA rating PG for rude humor including some reckless behavior and languageRunning time 1 hour 20 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Column Entertainment Animation (Movie Genre) Steve Carell Jennifer Garner Read more movie reviews gt;gt; Ed Oxenbould puts the Aussie in Alexander Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-alexander-terrible-horrible-day-review-20141010-column.html,200,alexanderandtheterriblehorriblenogoodverybadday7,alexanderandtheterriblehorriblenogoodverybadday,latimes
"Alexanders Terrible etc. Day is good family fun review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAlexanders Terrible etc. Day is good family fun reviewAlexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day is better than average Disney fare for the whole family. Ed Oxenbould is clearly having a terrible horrible no good very bad day.  (Dale Robinette / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Oct. 9 2014Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad DayStarring Steve Carrell Jennifer Garner Ed Oxenbould. Directed by Miguel Arteta. Opens Friday Oct. 10 at GTA theatres. 81 minutes. PG.Some days its just not worth getting out of bed.Article Continued BelowThe Cooper family has that experience in Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day and it may well because of the title character.Feeling that no one in his family understands him and his problems such as gum stuck in ones hair Alexanders birthday wish upon a cupcake inadvertently plunges the rest of the family into a day that features all kinds of mayhem.Not serious mayhem mind you. More like Disney-style mayhem the studio behind the film.So Dads job interview is disrupted when baby Trevor eats a green magic marker the launch for a childrens book at Moms firm goes badly awry over a misprint older brother Anthony gets a major zit on the day hes supposed to take a driving test and his girlfriend to the prom and older sister Emilys star turn as Peter Pan is confounded by a bad cold and way too much cough syrup.Director Miguel Arteta whos previous work is a mixed bag of television and film gets almost everything right here including bringing together a solid cast which includes Steve Carrell as the manically upbeat house husband (or ""fommy"" for father-mommy) and Jennifer Garner whose brown eyes and furrowed brow nicely channel maternal love and concern.The kids are all right as well including Ed Oxenbould as Alexander. Hes neither too cute nor too precious and has just the slightest bit of a speech problem t hell probably outgrow. Megan Mullally has a hilarious but all-too-brief cameo as Moms boss radiating alpha female menace through her glasses and Jennifer Coolidge is wonderfully wicked as a drivers licence tester who takes sadistic glee in crushing the hopes of others.Adults will learn that ""tight"" now means ""good"" in teenspeak and one line of a dialogue seems decidedly subversive for a Disney film ""Dont blow on my didgeridoo."" (Alexander is a rabid Australophile).A cameo by Dick Van Dyke as Dick Van Dyke is wasted and even a bit sad because his voice is so quavery. The happy ending birthday party scene featuring a live crocodile and some Aussie male dancer/strippers suggests that Alexanders dad has taken indulgence to a degree bordering on insanity.Of mild concern is how they managed to get the baby (played by twin girls Elise and Zoey Vargas) to cry so often as required when little Trevor loses his favourite pacifier. Otherwise the script by Rob Lieber -- no doubt contemporized from the 1972 novel by Judith Viorst -- has plenty of witty dialogue gags and physical comedy to please younger audiences and a story that gallops along at a pace brisk enough for kids with abridged attention spans.Adults and kids know pretty much what to expect from a Disney film and by that measure this film with a very long title is only going to be a source of grief for movie theatres with very limited space on their marquees -- and perhaps for headline writers as well.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsWhy does Torontos east end hate everything?Residents in Leslieville and the Beach have complained about everything from breweries to music festivals.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Every day is a terrible day filled with gum in his hair or a mishap in science class in front of his school crush and worst of all the most popular kid at school is having a party on the same night of his 12th birthday celebration. Alexander is surrounded by an upbeat recession family -- a dad (Steve Carell) who has been laid off from his aerospace engineering job and is now the ""fommy"" (father mommy) for the baby brother a working mom (Jennifer Garner) with parenting guilt a popular older brother (Dylan Minnette) who is about to be prom king and a confident older sister (Kerris Dorsey) who is a budding actress.On the eve of his birthday Alexander is already fretting about his doom-filled party ""I feel like no one understands me."" He wishes his family could relate and that they could experience his epic fails. Thus begins the familys journey into a day filled with failures and ultimately to a truth overscheduled families know all too well A family that sticks together stays together.Based on the popular grade-school tome with the same title the Disney film smartly strays from the book by including modern-day dilemmas. Carrell is somewhat subdued in his role as patriarch and more scenes displaying his comedic chops would have been appreciated. Garner aptly plays the frazzled mom and supporting siblings do a fine job. Dont miss Jennifer Coolidges delightful turn as driving test examiner Ms. Suggs and Bella Thorne (Disneys Shake It Up) playing a meanie of a girlfriend.While the laughs are predictable this is sweet family fare.

A kid causes havoc for his family. Director Miguel Arteta (121). PG Mayhem. Area theaters. Its almost not fair to pick on a movie like ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day."" First the temptation to label the film by its title is too easy. Second its a family film that while not elevating any IQ points wont do irreparable damage either. ""Alexander"" is however just another loud boy-centric comedy aimed at tweens. The movie turns a slight childrens book -- in this case Judith Viorsts 1972 fave from which it takes mainly the title -- into a charmless mishmash. Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) is turning 11. His frenzied dad and mom (Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner) barely have time to arrange a so-not-cool party given dads search for employment moms upcoming presentation at work and the overshadowing presence of Alexanders older siblings Anthony (Dylan Minnette) and Emily (Kerris Dorsey) and newborn brother Trevor. After a rotten day at school Alexander makes a ""Big""/""Home Alone""-like wish that his family members have a bad day too. Next morning sure enough Anthonys driving test goes badly Emily gets a cold as shes about to perform in a school play and his parents face massive job screw-ups. Director Miguel Arteta made his name with edgy indies like ""Chuck amp; Buck"" and ""The Good Girl."" He also made the wonderful underrated ""Cedar Rapids."" Here hes just part of the machine trying to copy the more enjoyable ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" movies. Ed Oxenbould sizzles in Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day. (Dale Robinette) Arteta instructs the actors to amp up the wackiness cookie-cutter style. Only Carell benefits. The young cast is energetic but the hard work is in the service of a noisy contraption. This may make kids -- especially the under-10 audience -- wonder why theres not a lot of Alexander in the film and why theres so much terrible.

Photo Credit Disney / Dale Robinette advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young boy and his family cope with problems big and small. Rated PG (some saucy slang). BOTTOM LINE Judith Viorsts 32-page childrens classic is now a rather slim Disney feature. Its short but sweet. CAST Ed Oxenbould Steve Carell Jennifer Garner Bella Thorne LENGTH 121 Judith Viorsts 1972 childrens book ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" tells the story of a boy plagued by minor misfortunes -- lima beans for dinner for example. Because its protagonist (named after Viorsts own son) is not a brave stoic but a self-pitying whiner ""Alexander"" feels honest and real a fable about hard truths and coping skills. Still in print after 42 years its worthwhile reading for adults too. At 32 pages the book may seem an unlikely candidate for a feature-film adaptation but hey -- it worked for ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" (two movies 517 million worldwide). ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" a Disney film stretches the book thinner than pizza dough and feels about as nutritious. Still its intentions are good and so is its cast particularly Ed Oxenbould a bright-eyed expressive 13-year-old making his screen debut as Alexander Cooper. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break The movie ages Alexander a bit -- hes about to turn 12 -- and although he still dreams of running away to Australia he also has tweenage concerns fickle friends popularity contests an unobtainable girl named Becky (Sidney Fullmer). The rest of the Coopers however are infuriatingly happy. Just after midnight Alexander makes a birthday wish that they might share his pain. Faster than you can say ""Freaky Friday"" things begin going south for everyone. Ben the Cooper familys upbeat patriarch (an endearing Steve Carell) suffers through a disastrous job interview; his wife Kelly (Jennifer Garner) a childrens book publisher flubs an entire printing. Life will also barf on Alexanders older siblings Emily and Anthony (Kerris Dorsey and Dylan Minnette) in literal and figurative ways. Bella Thorne plays Celia Anthonys insufferable prom-queen girlfriend. Breezily directed by Miguel Arteta (""The Good Girl"") from Rob Liebers script ""Alexander"" runs a scant 81 minutes making it awfully short but mostly sweet. One note for fans of the book Oxenbould the young actor happens to be from Australia. 236 MoviesAlexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day trailer PLOT A young boy and his family cope with problems big and small. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (some saucy slang) CAST Ed Oxenbould Steve Carell Jennifer Garner Bella Thorne LENGTH 121 BOTTOM LINE Judith Viorsts 32-page childrens classic is now a rather slim Disney feature.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Disney has taken a 40-year-old classic kids tale and fashioned it into a modern family movie that refreshingly stars good old-fashioned humans instead of phantasmagorical animated creatures. In Judith Viorsts book ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" a boy feels that everyone around him is coasting through life on rays of sunshine while he alone is bogged down with a childs version of the trials of Job. The breezy movie version stretches his calamities out over two days and ramps up the action by tossing in the misadventures of Alexanders five other family members. After getting gum in his hair and tripping over an automatic lawn sprinkler in front of his crush Becky Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) nearly burns down the science lab and finds out a more popular boy is having a birthday party the following day the same day as his own party. Unemployed Dad (Steve Carell the comic glue who keeps things humming) gets called ""fommy"" (father-mommy) at baby yoga class and has to tote his toddler along to an interview at a video-gaming company with potential bosses half his age. Meanwhile publishing executive Mom (Jennifer Garner) is prepping for the big launch of her companys new potty-training book (under the withering eye of Megan Mullally). Older brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) is nervous about taking his drivers ed test so he can squire his petulant girlfriend (Bella Thorne) to the prom. Older sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) is popping cold pills like crazy so she can take the stage as Peter Pan that afternoon in the school play. What else could go wrong? Plenty including an out-of-control minivan (featuring the reliably hilarious Jennifer Coolidge in a cameo as a no-nonsense driving instructor) a very unfortunate typo projectile vomit and a flaming pirate shirt. ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE HORRIBLE NO GOOD VERY BAD DAY  out of 4 stars Rating PG for rude humor some reckless behavior and language. At a time when some families face daily issues like oh starvation homelessness Ebola and drone strikes the Coopers dilemmas definitely qualify as First World problems. But theyre humorously relatable and director Miguel Arteta previously known for thoughtful/funny little indies aimed at older audiences (""Youth in Revolt"" ""The Good Girl"") keeps the dominoes falling at a fidgeter-friendly pace. By the time the back-yard b-day bash rolls around the tattered crew has had its fill of surprises. Yet of course there were a few more including a group of very fit ""Aussie cowboys"" who turn out to be strippers (and quickly modify their act upon sizing up their audience).

Alexanders day is only terrible by First World standards. A popular kid throws a party the same day as Alexander does and his guests bail. When his brother is talking with his girlfriend on the phone Alexander mistakes the encouragement as meant for him. He wakes up with gum in his hair. Fires flare. He trips in front of the girl he likes.Screenwriter Rob Lieber expands the tale by giving Alexander an older sister in addition to older and younger brothers and throwing in a second day when things go right for Alexander and wrong for everyone else. That gives Alexander as a veteran of terrible days the chance to guide the others and become the hero.Miguel Arteta directs with a deft hand and the performances charm. Steve Carrell and Garner bring a light comic touch to parents managing the chaos. Ed Oxenbould is appealing as the put-upon Alexander as are Dylan Minnette as the older brother obsessed with the prom and Kerris Dorsey as the sister with dreams of middle school stage stardom.Southlakes Sidney Fullmer last years American Girl video star brings a genuine niceness to the object of Alexanders attention; the marvelous Dick Van Dyke sadly is wasted in a convoluted subplot. Theres a good message about being resilient and drawing strength from your family.Its just that gum in the hair aside Alexanders intact family comfortable home and extravagant party dont ever at any point look all that terrible. ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE HORRIBLE NO GOOD VERY BAD DAY (B)Directed by Miguel Arteta. PG (for rude humor including some reckless behavior and language). 82 mins. In wide release.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Based on a childrens picture book Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) gets his birthday wish fulfilled when he transfers his bad luck to the other members of his family in ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day."" (Walt Disney Pictures) By Sandie Angulo Chen October 9 2014 Going to a live-action family film usually entails plenty of eye rolling low expectations and overpriced concessions. Parents chalk it up to yet another selfless thing they do for their children in lieu of enjoying Oscar-bound prestige films dark twisty thrillers or raunchy comedies. So imagine the novelty of a family-friendly movie that manages to make parents and older siblings laugh while still firmly appealing to the elementary-school crowd. ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" is the latest adaptation of Washington area author Judith Viorsts classic 1972 picture book which was previously turned into an animated television special for HBO (1990) and a childrens musical that premiered at the Kennedy Center more than a decade ago. In this film version director Miguel Arteta and screenwriter Rob Lieber keep the premise but expand the central theme with a dash of magical realism. Alexander Cooper (Ed Oxenbould) believes hes had more than his fair share of terrible days while his family seems to coast through life on a never-ending wave of good luck. The day before his 12th birthday for example is an epic disaster Gum gets stuck in his hair he nearly burns down his science class and he finds out that the most popular kid in his grade is hosting a birthday party -- complete with an energy-drink bar Korean taco truck and fog machine -- at the exact same time as Alexanders. Meanwhile his oldest brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) learns he and his girlfriend (Bella Thorne) are shoo-ins for prom court; older sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) prepares to take the stage as the lead in the school musical; Mom (Jennifer Garner) is on the verge of a promotion; Dad (Steve Carell) has an interview lined up with a cool video-game company; and baby Trevor says his first word. Wheres the justice? Alexander wonders. So at the stroke of midnight he makes a special birthday wish that his family would finally experience the kind of awful day normally reserved for him. The next morning the universe obliges. Everything goes wrong for the other Coopers while things start magically looking up for Alexander. To be sure the broad physical comedy is predictable and occasionally cringe-inducing but the cast pulls off the jokes. Carell is in his element as the optimistic father juggling baby duty with his interview with a group of young hipsters (including the excellent Donald Glover). Garner who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms is pleasantly frazzled as she attempts to run her household and impress her jaded publisher boss (Megan Mullally). The talented younger actors handle the comedy like pros whether its subtle bits (Anthonys conversation with his drivers license instructor played by the inimitable Jennifer Coolidge) or obvious sight gags (Emilys high-on-cough-syrup performance as Peter Pan). And as for Alexander he is the rare kid character who doesnt cross the line from charming to annoying. Arteta keeps the pace fast and frenetic and doesnt mind spotlighting potty jokes (literally -- Dick Van Dyke hilariously appears as himself reading a misprinted childrens book about kids who take a ""dump"" instead of ""jump"") but even the bathroom humor is forgivable when the end result is a crowd-pleasing comedy and a surprisingly entertaining treat for the whole family. Chen is a freelance writer.    PG. At area theaters. Contains rude humor including some reckless behavior and language. 81 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 701 p.m. EDT October 9 2014The scene is ablaze with Ed Oxenbould as the lead in the motion picture ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day."" The movie opens Friday nationwide.(Photo Dale Robinette Disney Enterprises) 59 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMOREIt may have the years longest title but Alexanders movie is not terrible horrible or even half bad. In fact Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day (1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) is a pleasant entertaining way to spend just under 90 minutes particularly if accompanied by children.The movies appeal is largely due to director Miguel Artetas light touch as well as the affability of Steve Carell and the low-key charm of the titular tween character played by Ed Oxenbould.USA TODAYOxenbould is enjoying very good days as AlexanderAlexander is easy to identify with. Hes a middle child surrounded by good-natured siblings and well-meaning parents (Carell and Jennifer Garner) who rarely have bad days. Yet Alexander feels dogged by misfortune.His 12th birthday party looms but a more popular classmate is having a party on the same day that promises more fun better games and a hot tub. Everyone including his best friend is going to the other party. Plus In trying to impress the cute girl he likes (Sidney Fullmer) Alexander nearly burns down the schools chemistry lab.Though it updates and expands upon Judith Viorsts 1972 childrens book the movie still captures the travails of middle-school existence with humor and plenty of goodnatured mayhem. It doesnt overplay the craziness however. Thats not to say theres much subtlety here. Rather its forgettable cheerful fun reminiscent of such Disney family fare as Flubber.Only half the movie focuses on Alexanders rotten experience. As a result of an innocent wish he makes while blowing out a candle on a birthday sundae mishaps befall his entire family. Silly shenanigans ensue.On the morning of the prom Alexanders 16-year old brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) wakes up with the biggest zit of his life -- right in the middle of his forehead. Later his disastrous driving test is one of the films funniest scenes presided over by a hilariously conniving official (Jennifer Coolidge).A mishap involving Alexanders publishing exec mom (Garner) that results in an embarrassing celebrity reading by Dick Van Dyke (in a short-but-sweet cameo) seems more far-fetched than laugh-inducing.Not surprisingly given his comic expertise Carell is responsible for some of the funnier moments. He plays an eternally optimistic rocket scientist laid off from his engineering job. A stay-at-home dad who can make a mean frittata hes so agreeable and devoted to fatherhood that he goes to Mommy amp; Me yoga. And enjoys it. Hes especially thrilled when baby Trevor utters his first word ""Fommy"" (for Father Mommy.)The movie suffers a bit structurally when Alexander confesses his birthday wish is the source of all the unpleasant goings-on but its saved by Carells goofy bout with a wayward kangaroo.Arteta best-known for directing offbeat indies such as 2000s Chuck amp; Buck and 2011s Cedar Rapids keeps it all from being too gooey.The overall message is pleasantly sweet Bad days happen. Not only are they inevitable but they serve to make the good times worth savoring.Theres nothing dreadful about that.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Eleven-year-old Alexander experiences the most terrible horrible day of his young life finding litte sympathy from his family he begins to wonder if only bad things happen to him.

VPC Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 354 p.m. MST October 8 2014The film based on the popular childrens book doesnt have the same courage but its still laugh-out-loud funny in places and thats enough.Ed Oxenbould appears in a scene from the film ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day.""(Photo Dale Robinette/Disney)Story HighlightsCritics review 3 starsThe film is based on the popular childrens book but doesnt have its courage.There are some big laughs many courtesy of Carell and Garner.Likable performances also help a lot.With a book this popular and an audience this devoted you just know there is going to be a furor over the liberties the filmmakers have taken with the details.""Gone Girl""? Oh no thats yesterdays news and last weeks opening.This time were talking about ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" Miguel Artetas film version of Judith Viorsts childrens book. The film retains some elements of the book which has sold more than 4 million copies since its publication in 1972 but screenwriter Ron Lieber has added a lot by necessity (the book is short).Related azcentral.coms newest movie reviews | 52 Fall films to see for everyoneAnd it turns out the film is not terrible or horrible or very bad. No good? Not that either. Its actually some good with some laugh-out-loud moments that help make up for a sappiness factor that is not present in the book in which bad things happen -- and keep happening -- to a boy.This is a Disney movie so things cant be too disastrous for too long. Happiness will out. But when things do go wrong the movie goes right for the most part.Alexander Cooper (Ed Oxenbould) is a 12-year-old boy used to having bad days. On this day he gets gum in his hair trips over a skateboard and spills the drink on his nightstand. This is before even leaving his bedroom.There are other disasters including setting the chemistry lab on fire with the notes of the girl he has a crush on (Sidney Fullmer) and learning that a popular kid is throwing an epic birthday party the next day -- the same day of Alexanders party.Steve Carells likable performance elevates ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day."" (Photo Dale Robinette/Disney)If thats not bad enough everything is going right for his family. Ben his dad (Steve Carell) is an aerospace engineer but he has landed a job at a gaming company. Kelly his mom (Jennifer Garner) is in line for a promotion at the publishing company where she works as long as she can pull off the debut of a potty-training book. Anthony his older brother (Dylan Minnette) is dating Celia the best-looking girl in school (Bella Thorne) and is taking her to the prom and Emily his older sister (Kerris Dorsey) has landed the lead in the school production of ""Peter Pan.""You get the idea. Its all too much. Even Baby Trevor (Elise and Zoey Vargas) is happy. So at midnight Alexander sneaks downstairs and fixes himself a birthday cupcake and makes a wish that his family could have just one rotten day so theyd know how it feels.Perhaps you can guess where this is leading.The next day everyone oversleeps. Anthony wakes up with an angry zit on his forehead. Emily who had to rehearse in the car left the interior light on killing the battery so Kelly has to find some other way to get to a reading of the new book that features Dick Van Dyke. Plus Emily gets sick because it was cold in the van. Ben turns out to be a lot older than his would-be employers and has to bring Baby Trevor to the interview. Things go further south from there.So bad in fact that the film is at times in danger of slipping into masochism. But Arteta who directed ""Cedar Rapids"" and ""Youth in Revolt"" among other films not much like this one manages to avoid that. Carell and Garner help a lot on that front too. Garner who plays an obsessive mother in ""Men Women amp; Children"" is much more enjoyable here. Not because her character is sweeter though she is but because shes willing to get tough when she needs to like in a scene in which she is trying to get to work but everything keeps going wrong; one bit feels like a nod to the ""Naked Gun"" movies and thats a compliment.The film does not have the courage of the book which felt no need to tie a nice pretty bow on everything. But its fun enough for a good while (its only 81 minutes long) and thats enough.Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad DayDirector Miguel Artera.Cast Steve Carell Jennifer Garner Ed Oxenbould.Rating PG for rude humor including some reckless behavior and language.AZCENTRALAlexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com; facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm; twitter.com/goodyk. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1vRIFJG More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Adults may approach Disneys Alexander And The Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day with understandable reluctance--its a feature-length film made out of a 20-page book. And while this isnt a movie that adults should seek out besides maybe catching it on cable parents can let down their guard. Alexander is a watchable affable pretty good well-done kids movie buoyed by a humorous script and talented cast.The main problem with Alexander is the sense that the plot has been stretched to its absolute limit a feeling that persists despite an 81-minute running time. The films first act echoes the events in the book with Alexander Cooper (Ed Oxenbould an Australian actor ironically playing an Australiaphile) beginning his day by falling on a skateboard getting gum in his hair and discovering that the most popular kid in school is throwing a birthday party on the same day he is. Things get worse from there until Alexander wishes aloud to no one in particular that his seemingly perfect family would have a terrible day as well. Here Alexander goes its own way and the next morning the Cooper clan wakes up to a series of mishaps emphasizing public humiliation property damage and baby pee. This is where Alexander feels its most shoehorned as the filmmakers seem to have abandoned logic in favor of giving every Cooper his or her own set of broadly comic high jinks. Start thinking too hard about the logistics of this disastrous day--why would the Coopers schedule Alexanders birthday party on the same day as his sisters play and his brothers prom?--and Alexander begins to crumble. Better to ignore these questions and concentrate on the dialogue some of which is laugh-out-loud funny (bravo to whoever did punch-up on this script) and will keep adults amused as their children howl with glee at the physical gags. The fact that the jokes land as well as they do can be attributed to the cast which is so strong that 12-year-old Oxenbould gets lost in the shuffle. Dylan Minnette on the other hand stands out as older brother Anthony giving a Channing Tatum-esque performance as a confident teenage bro. But the real stars of the film are Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner both consummate professionals as Alexanders beleaguered but good-natured parents. The supporting cast including Megan Mullally as Garners taskmaster boss Donald Glover as the head of a hip video-game company and Jennifer Coolidge as a sadistic driving-test administrator further ensures that Alexanders adult ensemble outshines its juvenile one. Ultimately the message of the film--that bad days are a part of life and can actually help us appreciate the good ones--is a productive one for kids even if its undermined by the relentless corporate-mandated ""happily ever after"" optimism that is Disneys specialty. The Mouse House influence is also felt in director Miguel Artetas unobtrusive direction and the films perfectly-manicured suburban setting a place in which no bad day no matter how catastrophic can stick.

Photo Disney MOVIE REVIEW Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day Running time 81 minutes. Rated PG (mild crude humor). At the Lincoln Square the Kips Bay others. Can a series of irritating events make a movie? Yes but an irritating one ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day."" Twelve-year-old Alexander (a bland Ed Oxenbould) frets that things arent going so well for him -- seeking to start a fire with Becky (Sidney Fullmer) he starts one in Chemistry instead -- so as a birthday request he wishes his sunny-side-up family would experience some terrible and horrible for themselves. They do and Alexander feels guilty about having cursed everyone but everyone still loves one another so its OK. Ed Oxenbould stars as Alexander in the film.Photo Disney Unemployed Dad (Steve Carell) has an important job interview Mom (Jennifer Garner) is launching a new book at her publishing house big brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) hopes to pass his driving test so he can squire the hottest girl in school to the prom big sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) is playing Peter Pan in the play and infant brother Trevor will consider the day a success if he can avoid eating any green markers. All of these plans go askew but not hilariously so. More like depressingly. Anthony gets a zit on his forehead crashes the car in the test and is forced into a powder-blue tux for the prom. A missing car door is the least of ""Alexanders"" problems.Photo Disney Mom who apparently is both the head of marketing and the copy chief at her publisher gets blamed for an epic typo in a book about going to the potty. To my middle-aged soul most of the movie seemed either improbable without being over-the-top or drearily easy to imagine The car-crash scene in which director Miguel Arteta gamely tries to dial up the madcap instead just made me think of endless insurance hassles. Would small children react differently? Maybe Kids have no taste. But what ought to be a merry mishegas of misadventure came across as cramped and gray with all the youthful ebullience of stopped traffic. I dont expect kids raised on ""The Hunger Games"" are going to find much thats interesting about a girl flubbing her lines in the play because of too much cough syrup. Whats catching fire in this movie is Dads goofy pirate shirt in an open-flame Japanese restaurant. OK the movie is aimed at early-grade-schoolers but even 6-year-olds have been trained to expect spectacle and maybe even some wit. Getting half a dozen actors to run around being flustered for an hour isnt exactly as comically engaging as Dr. Seuss. It isnt even ""Monsters University.""

The technique for expanding a picture book to feature length film (granted its only 81 minutes) isnt great after having the day in question Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) wishes that his relentlessly positive family could know what its like to have undeniably bad days of their own. (Yeah take that positive thinkers) But what follows is pleasantly diverting a neat and unforced interweaving of mostly minor familial disasters experienced by Dad with a job interview (Steve Carrell unable to resist the spotlight in the end) Mom with a presentation (Jennifer Garner) big brother with a prom date and a drivers test (Dylan Minnette) and big sister with a lead in the school play (Kerris Dorsey). Oh and theres a baby. It almost works -- until the dream factory intervenes. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

The basic premise remains intact Twelve-year-old Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) has a terrible day at home and at school while the rest of his family has a great one. But before the life lesson can be learned (namely that everyone has bad days now and then) Alexander makes an early birthday wish let my parents and siblings know just how awful things can get. The next morning Alexanders unemployed dad (Steve Carell) is running late for his job interview his harried mom (Jennifer Garner) is dealing with major crises at work and brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) and sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) have their prom and school-play plans go spectacularly awry. Arteta (Youth in Revolt) has a flair for comic filmmaking evidenced by his crisp widescreen framing--an expansive shot of Alexanders packed classroom teems with droll energy--and breakneck pacing that distracts you from gags that fall flat (the giggle-to-groaner ratio is about even). Kids can come for the broad slapstick and bodily functions; adults can groove to the clever Dick Van Dyke cameo and inspired needle drops of songs by INXS and the Feelies. The movies admirable fleetness however doesnt mitigate some of its narrative errors--Alexanders opening voiceover suggests his family is totally oblivious to his role in their misery which is disproved by a later scene--nor does it counteract an overall sense of slightness that prevents this from being a family-film classic.

All Rights Reserved. Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day actually covers two days. The first is the birthday eve of Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) a lousy day that garners little sympathy from his family. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - He wishes his happy family members would know what its like for things to suck and then they all have a rotten and absurdly packed day one in which Alexanders househusband father Ben (Steve Carell) has an important job interview publishing-executive mother Kelly (Jennifer Garner) has to oversee a major book launch sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) is debuting as Peter Pan in a school play and brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) has his driving test and the junior prom.Everything that can go wrong does and while it has its moments Miguel Artetas comedy relies too much on gender-shaming and emasculation jokes. Alexander becomes a laughingstock when pictures circulate of his face pasted on sexy ladies bodies; because Ben is the primary caregiver to the family infant hes labeled a Fommy (its a portmanteau geddit?); and when circumstances force Ben to don a pirate shirt characters insist on calling it a pirate blouse like nobody does in reality.

Both movies after all feature an underappreciated protagonist celebrating a birthday (in this case Aussie actor Ed Oxenbould in the title role) a sister hopped up on meds a snooty prom queen vehicular mischief and parents who -- when all is said and done -- love their kids even if they get lost in the craziness of day-to-day minutiae. Whats missing from ""Alexander"" is the craziness; we understand that a live-action Disney comedy is going to be blandly wholesome and tucked away in the cozy Toluca Lake cul-de-sacs that have provided the studios locations since the days of ""Flubber."" But for a comedy set around one epic catastrophe of a rotten day this wisp of a farce feels strangely chaos-deficient. See video Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day Movie Trailer Debuts (Video) Based on Judith Viorsts popular childrens book (and adapted to the screen by first-timer Rob Lieber) the film opens with young Alexander having a crummy time of it a popular classmate is planning to host a rival 12th birthday party the following day thus ensuring that no one will attend Alexanders. Our hero is also the victim of vindictive photo texts he gets gum in his hair his teacher assigns someone else Australia for a geography project (even though Alexander is totally into that country) and he accidentally lights a pretty girls science notes with a Bunsen burner. Making matters worse is the fact that the rest of his family all seem to be living charmed lives sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey ""Ray Donovan"") is about to play Peter Pan in the school play; handsome and vain Anthony (Dylan Minnette ""Prisoners"") is a day away from getting his drivers license and being crowned Prom Duke alongside his demanding girlfriend Celia (Bella Thorne); mom Kelly (Jennifer Garner) is set to get a big promotion at work; and dad Ben (Steve Carell) just got a job interview seven months after losing his gig in the aerospace industry. Wishing on a birthday candle just after midnight Alexander desires to have his family find out what its like to have a rotten day. And they do with calamities that include ill-timed phone calls cough syrup abuse pirate blouses and Alexanders infant brother Trevor (played by female twins Elise and Zoey Vargas) developing a taste for highlighter ink. Also read Foxcatcher Triumphs at Yet Another Film Festival These incidents of relative lunacy are couched in comedy-killing pauses in which the parents and siblings talk each other off the ledge providing each other encouragement and strengthening their family bonds. Sure you want to build up to that sort of thing but director Miguel Arteta (operating about as far away from his breakout film ""Chuck and Buck"" as he possibly could) never lets the proceedings get wild and crazy enough for the kind of comedy of disaster and discomfort that ""Alexander"" should rightfully be. Its funny when a zonked-out Emily in her flying harness destroys the second-worst production of ""Peter Pan"" in history but in the next scene everyone gets to regroup before the next calamity happens. Even the catastrophes themselves seem fairly weak Anthony gets a blemish and a powder-blue tux on prom day but the character is so strikingly handsome that neither feels like a deal breaker. Also read Men Women amp; Children Review Jason Reitmans Stab at 21st Century Drama Becomes Unintentional Comedy (The films best disaster befalls Kelly in a sequence involving Dick Van Dyke playing himself and an unfortunate misspelling in a potty-training picture book for kids.) Theres nothing despicable (or terrible or horrible) about ""Alexander"" -- any movie that finds room for Jennifer Coolidge as a tough-as-nails DMV tester cant be all bad -- but its a disappointingly inert comedy. These characters should have to suffer twice as many embarrassments if they want to earn all those adjectives in the title. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Mom is harried and not quite present. The babys difficult the eldest boy is girl crazy the only girl is completely self-involved and the tortured middle-child is well pretty tortured. Meet the Coopers. Also please lets salute the Coopers -- a movie family that for once seems to hit that rare sweet spot of comical reality where no one is improbably perfect yet neither are they screaming screw-up caricatures. And thats a lot of what makes ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" work. The movie is based on Judith Viorsts beloved childrens book (which was also a TV cartoon special at one point). And the films had a slightly bumpy road getting here with another studio (and a completely different script) disappearing along the way. But this screenplay by Rob Lieber smartly expands the original idea with an entirely new second act (poor put-upon Alexander wishes his family could have a day as bad as hes just had -- and they do). And director Miguel Arteta keeps things bumping along nicely. Arteta is certainly a surprising choice. Hes done comedy before but the adult comedy of discomfort. ""The Good Girl"" (with Jennifer Aniston having a fling with a teenager) and ""Cedar Rapids"" (with Ed Helms at a disastrous convention) were both his and not the sort of edgy fare that usually wins a director an interview at Disney. But good for them. Its Artetas ease with generating that slight sense of social awkwardness that makes ""Alexander"" a cut above the usual live-action family comedy. Of course the cast helps too. Steve Carell is his usual hard-working quietly normal stuff as the Dad (and its nice to see for a change a movie Dad who isnt a fool or a child; Mr. Cooper may be out of work but hes still intent on taking care of his family every way he can.) And after her sour strident turn in ""Men Women amp; Children"" its a delight to see a goofy Jennifer Garner again happily jumping into slapstick situations and bad haircuts. In fact bad haircuts -- and crooked teeth off-the-rack clothes and even the occasional pimple -- are all part of this family with its four pleasant but nonprecocious children. There isnt a sitcom brat in the bunch (and as Alexander Ed Oxenbould holds the whole thing together). Occasionally the humor tries a little too hard -- a bit too much running around a bit too much screaming. There are a couple of unnecessary bathroom jokes and some questionable humor about a 14-year-old getting accidentally zonked on cough syrup. (Really Disney?) The films far from perfect. But Arteta moves things along with bright candy colors lively music and barely time for a pause - and if theres a happy ending its one the characters have truly deserved. So two cheers for the Coopers. And one more for this movie. Ratings note The film contains some mildly strong language. Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day (PG) Disney (81 min.) Directed by Miguel Arteta. With Steve Carell Jennifer Garner Ed Oxenbould.

An average American family becomes a giant human pinata in ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" a passable tolerable not unbearable totally inoffensive adaptation of Judith Viorsts beloved 1972 childrens book. Made to exacting Disney specifications this is the sort of busily contrived one-damned-thing-after-another farce where cars are smashed and Dad gets set on fire but it all goes down with a spoonful of sugar and a cheery string of studio tie-ins -- its PG-rated sadism with a smile. With Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner on hand to enliven the proceedings the comedy at least zips along fast enough to wind up feeling almost shorter than its famous title which could spark enough recognition among tots and parents to steal a decent-sized portion of the all-ages pie. ""I think Ill move to Australia"" Alexander noted after the first of several groan-worthy setbacks in Viorsts book and screenwriter Rob Lieber has honored that detail by turning his 12-year-old protagonist (played by Aussie actor Ed Oxenbould) into a full-blown Oz enthusiast while later integrating a few well-trained marsupials into the otherwise all-human ensemble. Indeed one of the major blows Alexander Cooper suffers over the course of his terrible horrible etc. day is that he misses his chance to do a school report on his favorite continent. He also wakes up with bubble gum in his hair becomes a social-media laughingstock (kids these days) and learns that his preadolescent crush (Sidney Fullmer) and his best friend (Mekai Matthew Curtis) are ditching his upcoming birthday party. Clearly recognizing that a straightforward adaptation would yield barely enough material for a short (like HBOs half-hour 1990 animated version) Lieber and director Miguel Arteta shift the focus onto the boys parents and siblings all of whom seem to be enjoying life much more than he is. Mopey and resentful Alexander unwittingly brings a curse down upon his family sending the movie swerving abruptly into semi-supernatural ""Freaky Friday"" territory. And so thanks to a fateful alarm-clock malfunction Alexanders mom Kelly (Garner) is late for a major work engagement that involves a book reading by Dick Van Dyke (Disney tie-in No. 1) while his out-of-work engineer dad Ben (Carell) has to rush to a job interview with their screaming infant son in tow. Talented older sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) wakes up with a cold that will make it much harder for her to play Peter Pan in the school musical that afternoon (Disney tie-in No. 2). Meanwhile big brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) must battle a giant forehead zit and numerous episodes of relational angst with Celia (Bella Thorne) his terrible horrible no good very bad girlfriend. Various crises ensue Dangerous levels of cough syrup and permanent ink are ingested and copious amounts of snot vomit and urine are discharged. Before long the Coopers are facing several thousand dollars worth of property damage and future therapy bills as well as grim expressions of disapproval from numerous authority figures including Moms ultra-demanding boss (Megan Mullally) Emilys snippy drama teacher (Burn Gorman) and Anthonys driving-test administrator (Jennifer Coolidge onscreen far too briefly). Arteta whose accessible indie sensibility has pushed closer to the mainstream over the years (his prior feature was 2011s ""Cedar Rapids"") puts his actors through their paces with smooth uninspired professionalism. Nearly every major disaster can be spotted coming a mile away and not just because the movie opens -- in that pointless way that so many movies do nowadays -- at the end of the story rather than the beginning. Things move briskly enough that kids and parents wont feel too beleaguered by the end of the 81-minute running time though not so briskly that adults wont pick up on some of the clumsier implausibilities in the script. (Why would a school schedule a prom and a musical at the same time of year let alone on the same day?) One of the charms of the original book was that it just allowed stuff to happen rather than turning life into a series of carefully premeditated Rube Goldberg torture scenarios. Even better Viorst didnt feel the need to lift Alexanders spirits recognizing that bad moods come and go and most kids just need time and space to recover. Omitting that sort of pushy uplift here of course would be as unthinkable as leaving out the Disney logo and the final reels come packed with optimistic life lessons (""You dont always have to steer your ship with positivity"") restoring an atmosphere of forced cheer en route to an unreservedly happy ending. Oxenbould is appealing enough in the role of a kid who winds up somewhat sidelined by his own movie while Minnette and Dorsey offer solid backup as the older sibs. Wisely the pic cedes plenty of screen time to Garner and Carell who tuck into their mom and dad roles with practiced skill finding nice if predictably contrasting rhythms (shes tough and high-strung hes goofy and laidback). Production designer Michael Corenbliths sets look good even though they wind up taking a lot of punishment and the soundtrack includes an original tune ""Best Worst Day Ever"" (written and performed by Dorsey and her singer-songwriter sister Justine) happily supplanting the more obvious choice of Daniel Powters ""Bad Day.""

The book is a special one and as you mentioned fairly impossible to make a film of. But this movie wasnt bad sweet and quite funny and not even that exaggerated or maybe its just me whos had to take my kids to meetings because child care fell through Reply Jimmy Jay says October 3 2014 at 1204 pm Hey Justin....If you actually paid attention while watching the film you wouldve noticed that the Musical was at the Middle School and the Prom was at the High School.

In fact at a quick 82 minutes this straight-arrow family comedy about a day when misfortune comes to visit and stays awhile goes down relatively painlessly if one considers the repetitive nature of the pranks and pitfalls and the predictable message about family togetherness prevailing over adversity; just think gang we could be living in Syria. Presuming prospective viewers dont have to utter the entire title by memory to gain admission this Disney release looks to do solid mid-level business theatrically before becoming a kids home viewing staple. See more Hollywoods 100 Favorite Films Thirty-two-page childrens books with 18-syllable titles that are basically about one thing arent the easiest properties to adapt into feature-length scripts which may be why it took 42 years for someone to figure out how to handle Judith Viorsts perennial which has sold more than four million copies since its publication in 1972 and has spawned three sequels the latest published this year. Screenwriter Rob Liebers way of filling out the conceit to feature-length running time is to have atrocious things happen not only to the 11-year-old title character but to his entire family and spread the calamities across two days. If this just seems like too much negativity to contemplate or too close to real life this exercise in schadenfreude is in the event surprisingly good-natured and under Miguel Artetas fleet direction seemingly over in the snap of a finger. ""The day before"" the big day in question the agreeable Alexander (open-faced Australian Ed Oxenbould) receives a mighty blow upon learning that the most popular kid in school is throwing a party the next night at the same time as his own 12th birthday party meaning that no one including the girl he likes will come to his bash. Also on tap the next day His unemployed dad Ben (Steve Carell) has a big job interview with a video gaming company mom Kelly (Jennifer Garner) is overseeing a celebrity book reading event for her hard-to-please boss teen brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) is chauffeuring snooty girlfriend Celia (Bella Thorne) to the junior prom provided he passes his drivers test and sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) is starring in a school production of Peter Pan. Plus the baby of the family Trevor (Elise and Zoey Vargas) can be counted upon to continue crying a lot. Watch more Steve Carell Stars in Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day Trailer The worst day begins with everyone waking up late but if theyd known what was coming theyd have done well to call in sick and stay in bed all day. Alexander is the recipient of the only good news The popular kid has chicken pox so Alexanders bash is back on full steam. Otherwise Murphys Law lays siege to the family Emily becomes ill as well endangering her performance; the car battery dies on the day of Anthonys driving test a calamity that also forces Kelly to bike to her event (featuring an unbilled Dick Van Dyke) thats beset by a PG-lewd book misprint and the lack of a babysitter forces Ben to take baby Trevor along to meet his potential new bosses who are half his age. The arguable comic highlight is Anthonys driving test which is presided over by a farcically overbearing woman (Jennifer Coolidge) who plays a trick on him that if used by DMV officials in real life might take half of Californias drivers off the road. Kellys mishaps with her authors event simply seem too preposterous to be funny while the Peter Pan misadventures are similarly low-voltage. On the other hand the interplay between Ben and the gamer geeks is not unamusing even if Bens tolerance for agreeably filling the role of a ""fommy"" (father-mommy) would seem to exceed ordinary limits. The homily-laden wrap-up stressing the upside of bad days is enough to make you hold your nose but it only lasts a moment which is suggestive of the way Arteta and the cast provide the energy and momentum to get the job done but not overstay their welcome; piling any more cards on this house would have made it collapse altogether.
