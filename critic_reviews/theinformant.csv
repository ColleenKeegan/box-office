Its not the clever and silly story of an informant strands of Office Space and The Hudsucker Proxy running through it. No in fact it has much more in common with dark and brooding character studies such as The Talented Mr. Ripley and Fight Club. Is it as good as any of these titles? Not nearly. But I wanted to dispose of the marketing lie right from the get-go. There. Now its been disposed of. Lets move on. Matt Damon is ""the Informant"" -- a senior level executive at Archer Daniels Midland a company that according to their website transforms crops such as corn oilseeds wheat and cocoa into food feed and agriculturally derived fuels and chemicals. Obviously with a mission statement like that you could get away with bloody murder. I mean what does that even mean? And ADM is doing so at least until white knight Matt Damon begins cooperating with the FBI -- this plot point forms the crux of the initial narrative (and that pesky marketing). But where the movie deviates from this is pure spoiler territory so were not going to get into it. What the film does well is casting Matt Damon. Hes very good in this role even though tonally the film is weird. The pacing is also completely off; nothing happens for a good long while a few site gags and then a boatload of info is dumped upon you. The Informant seems to be Soderberghs attempt to bridge the divide between his commercial (Oceans Eleven Twelve Thirteen) and his non-commercial (The Girlfriend Experience Che Solaris) work. The film has some of the gloss of the Oceans projects while retaining the expectation upon the audience to not completely check out. Joel McHale and Scott Bakula are also solid in their roles as the FBI agents tasked with bringing Damons case in. Theyre at once confused upset jocular and conscientious ... no small feat for about 20 minutes of screen time. Theres also a Cusack in this film Ann Cusack is McHale and Bakulas superior within the Bureau -- she also speaks with that delightful and instantly recognizable Cusack accent. Good times. I suppose Im willing to forgive The Informant for the false advertising overall lack of direction and semi-coherent plot because it has moments and actors that really work. They dont fill an equitable percentage of the film but theyre the things that stay with you after you walk out. In the end it seems as though its better to aim for searing moments and whiff on greatness than to shoot for the middle and hit it.

On one level it denotes the lack of delicacy with which Matt Damons prodigiously gifted agribusiness exec Marc Whitacre goes about blowing the whistle on his own company for being involved in a global price-fixing swindle. Yet it also suggests a thematic sleight of hand that asks us to be aware that the films motivations may not be as cut-and-dried as they first appear. This ambiguity of intention is largely (and successfully) transmitted via Damons supremely nuanced central performance (possibly a career best) which manages to plumb the depths of narcissism idiocy and eventually deep-seated psychosis while miraculously managing to keep us on side. The screwy semantics of his insistently upbeat internal monologues constantly interrupt the bloated technical jargon and subtly hint at the denouement to which Whitacres foolhardy endeavour is leading. The director himself continuously chips in from the sidelines  with screwball devices such as oversized title cards written in purple bubble text a camera that playfully dances in and out of the innumerable sterile business headquarters and hotels and Marvin Hamlischs chirpy big-band soundtrack. Soderbergh and writer Scott Z Burns have based the film largely on the muckraking thriller by New York Times journalist Kurt Eichenwald but they are less interested in the particulars of nefarious corporate dealings than in creating a credible psychological portrait of a man driven by... who knows what?

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor September 25 2009 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Movie review The Informant For ""The Informant"" where he plays real-life Mark Whitacre the executive at agricultural megabusiness Archer Daniels Midland who in the early 1990s turned FBI snitch Matt Damon adds on a fake moustache bulbous nose and 20 pounds.Steven Soderberghs new movie written by Scott Z. Burns and based on Kurt Eichenwalds nonfiction book is about corporate malfeasance in high places and functions as a kind of alternate universe to his ""Erin Brockovich"" a considerably more straightforward whistle-blower thriller. Here the seriousness of the subtext - ADM was involved in big-time price fixing - is counterbalanced by the zaniness of the text starting with that exclamation point in the films title.Marvin Hamlischs score has a knockabout freneticism that seems more 60s than 90s and Soderbergh at times employs camera moves like suddenly spinning the image upside down that are the cinematic equivalents of whoopee cushions. This is all oddly appropriate since Whitacre a wonkish biochemist who plied his way to a plush lifestyle is mighty strange. As his entanglements with the FBI and ADM ensue his behavior becomes ever more untrustworthy and fantastical. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Damon is an agile comic performer and Soderbergh knows how to serve him up without losing sight of the ultimate seriousness behind it all. Grade B+. Rated R for language.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 18 2009 440 PM The Informant Steven Soderbergh confuses me By Dana Stevens After youve seen The Informant come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion You can also click hereto download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. Matt Damon in The Informant The Informant (Warner Bros.) a true-life tale of corporate malfeasance directed by Steven Soderbergh is a movie with bipolar disorder. It may or may not also be about a man with bipolar disorder--we never fully understand the motivations of Mark Whitacre the corporate whistle-blower played by Matt Damon. But on the diagnosis of the film itself Im solid. Soderbergh whiplashes his viewers between two contrasting mental states that are best described as ""jaunty"" and ""wrenching."" Some scenes manage to be jaunty and wrenching at the same time. As Mark spirals further down into legal quagmires and psychic disintegration the bouncy Marvin Hamlisch score which sounds like something a 70s cartoon character would bop down the street to grows ever punchier. Mark is a biochemist and high-level executive at Archer Daniels Midland the massive agricultural conglomerate that was the (thinly disguised) villain of 2007s Michael Clayton. As the movie opens Mark would seem to be the very model of a modern whistle-blower a square wholesome painfully earnest family man whos shocked by his companys possible involvement in an international price-fixing scheme. (Whitacres story as told here takes some liberties with the source material a book of the same title--sans exclamation point--by Kurt Eichenwald.) In the course of an FBI investigation into a lesser scandal at ADM Mark indicates to the agents on the case Shephard (Scott Bakula) and Herndon (Joel McHale) that he has the inside information to help them hook a bigger fish. Soon Mark is wearing a wire meeting regularly with the agents and providing tapes to the FBI to bring down his own company. Advertisement But there are signs from early on that something is amiss with Mark. His opening voiceover at first cheerfully expository quickly begins to drift into free-association territory (""Pen in German is Kugelschreiber ... so many syllables just to say pen""). Later when Mark describes a Japanese competitor visiting his office in an attempt to extort money from ADM it seems odd that Soderbergh wont provide a visual flashback; doesnt he know to show and not tell? Then we realize that the encounter with the Japanese man may never have happened. Is ADM really defrauding its stockholders or is Mark just making shit up? Before long it becomes clear that both things are true. Archer Daniels Midland is a corrupt player in the agribusiness industry and Mark Whitacre is a pathological liar. The process by which the increasingly perplexed FBI agents (and Marks incredulous lawyer played by king of the slow burn Tony Hale) figure this all out makes up the murky second act of the movie. The Washington Posts Dan Kois who discussed The Informant with me in a Spoiler Special podcast (see link above) mounted a well-argued case that the sense of brain fog that descends during this middle section of the movie was exactly the effect Soderbergh was going for that the audiences state of confusion was meant to mirror Marks own. That may be but if Im going to descend into a delusional netherworld with a movies protagonist I need to emerge from it with some clearer sense of who he is. Soderbergh; his screenwriter Scott Z. Burns (who also wrote The Bourne Ultimatum); and to some extent Damon all seem unclear on just how well were supposed to know Mark Whitacre or how we should feel about him. For much of the movie hes a bumbling buffoon his James Bond fantasies providing comical contrast to his unsubtle espionage technique. (Told that a surveillance camera will be hidden in a lamp during the meeting he goes right up to it and squints curiously into the lens.) Scene by scene Damons performance is funny (and theres something delightful about seeing lean mean Jason Bourne with a paunch and an awful toupee). But finally Marks collection of bizarre behaviors doesnt add up to a character. Its one thing to build a film around someone whos an unknowable cipher (the Philip Seymour Hoffman vehicle Owning Mahoneydid this well); its something else again to show a guy acting entertainingly nutty for two hours then try to milk the audiences sympathy with a tight close-up of his face as he finally breaks down. The Informant is most engaging if you stop trying to decide whether its a psychodrama or a spy caper and decide instead to regard it as an exercise in style. Though its set in the early 90s the movie (filmed on location in Decatur Ill.) has a deliberately dingy 70s feel; its muddy brown business suits and cluttered ill-lit office sets come straight from the world of post-Watergate conspiracy thrillers. Theres a meticulous attention to design detail (the vast chintz-stuffed house that the Whitacres live in was the couples home in real life) and some fun casting choices. For reasons that arent clear Soderbergh decided to cast nearly every small role with a well-known comedian--in addition to Joel McHale as an FBI agent there are cameo appearances from Patton Oswalt Tom Wilson Paul F. Tompkins and both the Smothers Brothers. Marks wife Ginger an old-school stand-by-your-man type is expertly played by the wide-eyed and baby-voiced Melanie Lynskey (last seen amateur pole-dancing in Away We Go). Soderberghs choices are all deliberate and often interesting. But The Informant has that old jigsaw-puzzle quality not uncommon in Soderbergh films of adding up to less than the sum of its parts.

"Informant The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; informant-the ) Informant The (United States 2009) September 18 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Under the control of a different director The Informant might have been a reasonably straightforward thriller. With Steven Soderbergh at the helm however this has become a whimsical semi-comedic romp complete with a score by Marvin Hamlisch that recalls kitschy 70s TV shows cutesy captions and a tongue-and-cheek approach to the entire story. Although loosely based on the true-life book by former New York Times journalist Kurt Eichenwald (who also serves as a producer) Soderbergh has transformed this into a treatise on the incompetence of everyone involved the informant the corporation upon which he informs the lawyers and the FBI. Strangely enough its completely believable. Matt Damon plays the title character Mark Whitacre who is a biochemist working in an executive position for corporate giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) based in Decatur Illinois. When he becomes uneasy about a price fixing scheme Mark goes to the FBI and reveals his concerns to Special Agents Brian Shepard (Scott Bakula) and Bob Herndon (Joel McHale). They rig him with a wire and get him to make over 200 tapes of meetings and conversations to use as evidence. But there are some questions. What is Mark getting out of this? Is he as clean and reliable a witness as he initially seems? Unraveling the mysteries around Mark and his motives generates more interest than the rather pedantic circumstances surrounding ADMs illegal activities. Movies with unreliable narrators can be fun because the viewer only thinks he knows whats going on and it would be difficult to find a less trustworthy storyteller than Mark Whitacre. We get a sense of this early in the proceedings when Marks voiceovers start offering tangential observations completely unrelated to the narrative. Its disconcerting to hear Matt Damons voice offering an opinion about something that has nothing to do with whats transpiring on-screen. Some of the things he believes are at variance with the reality in which the movie is set. He sees himself as a secret agent when in reality hes closer to Maxwell Smart than James Bond. Matt Damon is virtually unrecognizable as the mustachioed Mark wearing spectacles and a too-furry toupee. Hes about as far from the lean-and-mean Jason Bourne as can be imagined. Damon provides the films star power. From him its a significant step down to the next recognizable name (Scott Bakula) and an even further step beyond that. Soderbergh has rarely been concerned about stocking his films with famous people and this is evidence of that. Even though Damon is generally deemed as ""bankable"" his performance here is along the lines of what might expect from a character actor not a headliner. The films quirky subject matter makes it more difficult to get a handle on than projects like Erin Brokovich and The Insider where the toll of corporate malfeasance can be easily quantified and measured in terms of human suffering. In this case the bottom line is that ADM is trying to collude with major corporations across the world to inflate profits for lysine a food additive made from corn. This is big business to be sure but the subject matter is pretty hard for a movie-goer to get worked up about. Thats why Soderbergh elected to focus less on the particulars of the investigation and more on the peculiarities of the whistle-blower. The resulting movie has its share of fun moments and is full of the absurd but its probably easier to admire for its craft than it is to enjoy as conventional entertainment. Nevertheless it evidences sufficient charm to make it worth viewing especially when one considers how barren the current cinematic landscape is.

Adapted from Kurt Eichenwalds nonfiction book this fact-based farce tells the story of Mark Whitacre a high-ranking Archer Daniels Midland executive who blew the whistle on a global price-fixing scheme in 1992 but turned out to be a giant headache for the U.S. Justice Department when skeletons began tumbling out of his own closet. Matt Damon gives a sure-handed comic performance as the ingratiating self-dramatizing businessman and Steven Soderbergh imparts a brisk breezy pace to the snowballing narrative. Unfortunately every laugh is bludgeoned nearly to death by Marvin Hamlischs jokey score of neo-James Bond riffs and 70s sitcom melodies; I liked the movie quite a bit but by the end I felt as if I were at a live TV show with a blinking sign ordering me to LAUGH.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The Informant feels like Steven Soderbergh was still high on the fumes of the ""Oceans Eleven movies when he made it. Its bright and perky with a naggingly effervescent score by Marvin Hamlisch that channels late 60s game shows and never shuts up even when you want it to. Soderberghs pushing the limits of our indulgence here spinning a story of white-collar greed and bipolar delusions into intentionally shallow pop farce. The movies fun to watch but you can tell it was a lot more fun to make and thats a problem. The party stays up on the screen; down here its been over for a year.That the movie works as well as it does is due to Matt Damon who plays the real-life corporate whistle-blower Mark Whitacre with comic verve and a really bad head of hair. Starting in the early 1990s Whitacre the youngest divisional president in the history of agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland worked with the FBI to document a huge price-fixing scheme in which ADM and its rivals controlled the market for lysine an essential amino acid.""The Informant - even the title surges with peppy irony - is based on a book by former New York Times reporter Kurt Eichenwald which made the most of Whitacres dysfunctions. Unknown to the agency their insider had dirty hands himself and was more than a little unhinged. Led by Special Agent Brian Shepard (a wonderfully woe-faced Scott Bakula) the Feds saw Whitacre as their ace in the hole. In Whitacres own mind he was ""Secret Agent 0014 cause Im twice as smart as 007. The comedy - the movies entire point really - is in that yawning gulf between the FBIs expectations and their moles nuttiness. Its like youre getting two Russell Crowe movies for the price of one ""The Insider and ""A Beautiful Mind.Whitacres mind is anything but beautiful. As voiced by Damon in chatty internal monologues that only slowly reveal their disconnect the whistle-blowers mental landscape is both grandiose and banal. A typical ramble ""Polar bears cover their noses when waiting for seals to surface. How do they know their noses are black? That seems like a lot of thinking for bears. This while hes supposed to be absorbing instructions from the FBI agents.Later wearing a wire Whitacre hilariously narrates his morning walk into ADMs headquarters greeting co-workers by full name and occupation. Hes writing the espionage movie thats already in his head and he couldnt be more delighted. Its at moments like this that you appreciate Damons happy knack for character comedy the straighter he plays it the funnier he is. Doughy and enthusiastic his ratty little moustache fooling no one the star is a treat especially in the climactic scenes when Whitacre starts literally coming apart at the follicles.A few too many scenes in ""The Informant are business meetings in which drab executives wearing drab neckties drone about drab subjects. (The baby-voiced Melanie Lynskey is so good in her scenes as the heros wife - the lone person in the movie with a conscience - that we want much more of her.) Soderbergh thinks its a giggle that such massive corporate crimes could be committed by small tacky men but he isnt really interested in them. He wants to marvel at Whitacre whose upbeat cluelessness grows more desperate as the walls close in.The movie doesnt spell it out but strongly implies that this manic-depressive self-regard - the gnawing need to be a Master of the Universe - is what got Whitacre and Archer Daniels Midland into trouble what got Bernie Madoff and AIG and Lehman Brothers into trouble what gets our whole go-go economy into trouble over and over again. Itd be a tragedy if it werent so richly absurd but it would also make for better comedy if the joke werent on us.

(Warner Bros.) Joe Neumaier Thursday September 17 2009 438 PM Title Theres a running commentary inside Steven Soderberghs ""The Informant"" a buttoned-down satire that moves at a steady click. The reedy voice we hear is Mark Whitacres (Matt Damon) sussing out various paranoid scenarios and ticking off odd facts. When its clear that Whitacre is trapped in his own beautifully bipolar mind all that chatter suddenly makes sense.Whitacre an Illinois-based biochemist-turned-manager at the Archer Daniels Midland company creates jitters in the early 90s by spotting a crisis in the agri-firms corn-based-substance labs. He then finds a cost-saving solution though that solution draws in the FBI who ask him to wear a wire to flush out corporate price-fixers.The efficient Whitacre is happy to help (""Its like a Crichton novel""). Of course hes happy to do anything because while the chipper family man has trouble separating fact and fiction he has no trouble setting up tricky financial schemes.This adaptation of a nonfiction book contains shadows of similar movies -- ""Catch Me If You Can"" ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" -- but has two aces going for it Soderberghs poking at the mazelike holes in American business and Damons whirling dervish performance. The actor goes through the movie wearing a droopy mustache a stuck-out gut and a crazy look in his eyes. As Whitacres web of lies get out of hand Damons alpha-male mannerisms are as gently teasing as Marvin Hamlischs goofball score which evokes the Muzak of a corporate training film.Soderbergh working in his A-game middle ground between micro-indies (""The Girlfriend Experience"") and big Hollywood titles (the ""Oceans"" capers) finds the right tone early and never falters. ""The Informant"" -- that exclamation point reflects Whitacres fervor -- isnt too wacky and thats fine. Corporate lunacy is funny enough.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Not that his movies are always classics. The naturalistic Che slogged painfully through the jungle while The Good German for all its monochromatic noir mannerisms never gelled as a story. But film buffs know that Soderbergh is always good for a few nerdy thrills (look at that 1.661 aspect ratio) and The Informant bestows a couple of nice ones Matt Damons old-fashioned brilliantly calibrated character turn as a corporate schnook-turned-whistleblower; and Marvin Hamlischs retro-groovy score. For the movies first hour or so the pair of them together make for four-star entertainment. The last half-hour not so much. Through not fault of his own Damons character -- a biochemist and executive named Mark Whitacre the man who sparked an FBI investigation into a global price-fixing conspiracy -- ultimately transforms from a likable goofball with a swooping toup into something stranger balder and tinged with sadness. Its a metamorphosis that all the sharp acting and swishy lounge jazz in the world cant quite accommodate. The tale of Whitacre is based in fact but not everyone knows the details so I wont blab too many of them here. Just the basics He worked for Archer Daniels Midland heading up its bio-products division in the early 1990s. As the movie opens he describes the companys corn-based products (""corn goes in one end profit comes out the other"") in a stream-of-consciousness voice-over that bounces under the plot. When theres trouble with the production of the additive lysine he tells his bosses theres a mole in the company -- a plant from a Japanese rival. Accusations of corporate espionage bring in FBI agent Brian Shepard (Scott Bakula his incredulity as thick as his hair gel) who gets more than he signed on for when Mark spills an even bigger story He describes a long-standing scheme to fix prices and divvy up the market for lysine a food additive produced by ADM and assorted international giants. That kicks off the movies loveliest funniest flakiest segment a snappy comic spy game that follows Whitacre on his unlikely new career as federal informant. Throughout a plump but fearless Damon grinning under a wide mustache conveys Marks hale-fellow chumminess and gargantuan self-deceit. Or is it? A whole lot of bamboozling goes on in this picture more than anyone can get a handle on but somehow its always the other guys who end up staring gape-mouthed at Mark. Once we reach that final 30-odd minutes the movie loses steam. The gags played out the Hamlisch the hamminess the mod fuchsia titles announcing new locales. We realize belatedly that the entire spoofy venture wasnt that much of a joke to begin with; some very serious issues were gurgling under the surface. What were we laughing at exactly? Oh thats right -- at the wit and skill of a Soderbergh movie whether its classic or not. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Bass Pro Shops Clearance Sale Deals from 1 + free shipping w/...

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Sep. 17 2009 438PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Informant Directed by Steven Soderbergh Written by Scott Z. Burns Starring Matt Damon Scott Bakula Joel McHale and Melanie Lynskey Classification 14A Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh has sometimes complained that audiences say they want something different from movies but when they get it they gripe that it doesnt fit a formula. Thats definitely a risk with The Informant  a bait-and-switch film that promises caper comedy with silly hair and dated-fashion costumes and ends up with something thats much weirder - a marshmallow-light corporate satire. In what amounts to homage to his own breakthrough commercial success Erin Brockovich  Soderbergh returns to the subject of the individual fighting the corporation. But The Informant is no Brockovich . Instead of Erin - Julia Roberts the teeth hair push-up bra and working-class indignation - we get Mark Whitacre a rich charisma-free science nerd with a high IQ and few social skills. Hes played by Matt Damon in an entertaining performance thats pumped-up in several ways Hes carrying an extra 30 pounds under boxy jackets with a beaver-pelt hairpiece aviator glasses and a Ned Flanders soup-strainer under his nose. Married to an unfailingly supportive and abetting wife (Melanie Lynskey) hes living the suburban Midwest dream. In the mid-nineties Whitacre was a real-life executive with the Illinois-based agribusiness giant ADM (Archer Daniels Midland). He became an instrumental figure in the FBI investigation leading to the largest successful prosecution of a price-fixing case in U.S. history. Unlike the corporate liars portrayed in Erin Brockovich and Michael Manns The Insider  ADM wasnt giving anyone cancer. Instead by illegally controlling the international price of the amino acid lysine they made it hard to comparison-shop for cereal and soft-drinks. The difference in the type of corporate cheating allows for comedy and The Informant  with its jaunty exclamation mark is Soderbergh in his slight-and-sly mode. The movie is something of a return to the puzzle-box procedural style of his Oceans movies after his more experimental efforts with Che and The Girlfriend Experience . From scene to scene the truth keeps appearing and disappearing. Early on Whitacre comes to his bosses with some important news A mysterious Japanese man knows what the problem is in the companys lab and for 10-million he can make it go away and ensure it never happens again. The FBI gets involved with a couple of decent regular-guy agents (Scott Bakula and comedian Joel McHale). After his initial resistance Whitacre is excited about the role hes about to play believing that it may actually be his stepping-stone to becoming head of the company. He tells the agents that there are much bigger fish to fry than just a bit of corporate extortion - theres price-fixing worth hundreds of millions. He agrees to wear a wire to record his bosses and their international colleagues in the industry and bursting with pride at playing secret agent he repeatedly almost blows his cover. He walks around the office muttering into his recorder (no one seems to notice). He starts to think of himself as a character in a John Grisham or Michael Crichton novel and as well as passing along invaluable information he also tells one big fat lie after another. Screenwriter Scott Z. Burns ( The Bourne Ultimatum ) peppers the script with Whitacres voiceover monologues a string of fantasies and non-sequiturs. (How do polar bears know their noses are black? How can Japanese men buy girls panties from vending machines?) Meanwhile Marvin Hamlischs jaunty Austin Powers -ish music percolates and burps along with a merry obliviousness suggesting Whitacres idea of himself as a worldly swinger. Of course the jokes on him and maybe us too. Whitacre apparently suffered from bipolar disorder (at least that was his legal defence strategy). Soderbergh suggests that the klepto-corporate mindset swings from delusional grandiose highs to feelings of betrayal and worthlessness. The Informant may be a gadfly of a movie but its not without bite Could it be that the economic collapse wasnt just because of greed and incompetence but because the corporate operators were so hypnotized by their own shell games that they could no longer tell the pea from the cups?

In a drama such a scene would come from the heart and aim for the gut. Here though were in the company of a very slippery fish and the scene strikes the tone of an Oscar acceptance speech delivered by a man who didnt actually win the award. Matt Damon beefed-up and grinning underneath a fake mustache and rug is wonderful as Whitacre a Decatur Ill. family man trained as a biochemist. More than any previous screen role this one affords Damon a chance to work his sly comic chops. In Soderberghs three ""Oceans"" films Damon played Robin to George Clooneys and Brad Pitts Batman. ""The Informant"" (complete with ironic exclamation point) showcases Damon as a related sort of naif a corn- and soybean-fed executive gabby and glad-handing. He seems honest. But hes a complicated fellow or rather a complex series of facades. Product warning Do not expect the wild farce promised by the ad campaign. Based on Kurt Eichenwalds exhaustive non-fiction chronicle the film is both outlandish and subtle. It begins conventionally enough as Whitacre informs his ADM bosses that the companys Japanese rivals are engaging in corporate sabotage mucking up their production of a food additive known as Lysine. The Feds are brought in to investigate and pretty soon an eager Whitacre is wearing a wire with the intention of getting evidence of price-fixing from the Japanese competitors. Scott Bakula and Joel McHale in nicely contrasting modes of slow-burn exasperation play FBI agents trying to figure out if Whitacres memory lapses and inconsistencies point to mere trouble or a larger more humiliating realm of disaster. Soderbergh shot the film on crisp honey-hued high-definition digital video set largely in generic Midwestern office spaces. Damons voice and demeanor are just right and the actor--who really is an actor a good one--works out Whitacres particularities like a character man stepping up to a leading role rather than a movie star slumming. I have no idea how large an audience ""The Informant"" is destined to attract. But thats one of its pleasures; it doesnt have a suck-up howm-I-doin? air. It lets Mark Whitacre take care of that department.Related items""The Informant"" photosThe jokes on the informerFrom Greg Burns Matt Damon shows how to lose an antitrust caseWatch Michael Phillips interview with Matt Damonvideo platformvideo managementvideo solutionsfree video player ""Informant"" trailer MPAA rating R (language)Running time 148Starring Matt Damon (Mark Whitacre); Scott Bakula (Agent Shepard); Joel McHale (Agent Herndon); Melanie Lynskey (Ginger Whitacre)Directed by Steven Soderbergh; written by Scott Z.

Pictures release. Posted at 040200 PM in Reviews Comments In Steven Soderberghs film The Informant Matt Damon plays a pitch perfect Power of Ambition protagonist. Although some critics and arm chair commentators have complained that the movie moves too slow or is boring-- I disagree. I found the fevered unraveling of Matt Damons character and his deceptions and lies fascinating to watch. There are no big actions sequences no shoot-outs and no chase scenes. If you come to the theater looking for an action-packed thriller like the Bourne series or the sharp witty seriousness of whistler-blower Erin Brockovich you will be disappointed. This is a meticulous character study about the bland banality of corporate greed the endless self-justification of scheming executives and the deluded self-seeking thats eating away at the American Dream. The upbeat jangle of Marvin Hamlischs insistently perky elevator music underscores Whitacres deluded optimism. Steven Soderbergh deliciously deadpan comedy is a brilliant subtle and painfully funny expose of the empty calories (literally and metaphorically) thats been making America both fat and undernourished at the same time. Like all Power of Ambition characters Whitacre is exceptionally adept at self-justification and at distracting himself from his own crimes and ethical short-comings. Always the eternal optimist Whitacre enthuses ""There are so many really nice people in the world."" even as his web of deception is unraveling around him. A character driven by the Power of Ambition is a staple of American movies. This Character Type can be a hardworking eager charming optimist with a ""can-do"" spirit (Tom Cruise as the title character in Jerry Maguire)--or a lying manipulative backstabbing striver who will do anything to get ahead in life (Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington in All About Eve). Jim Carrey in Liar Liar is another comedic version of the type. In my view of film there are Nine Character Types. For my complete review of this movie and more information on all Nine Character Types visit my website. http//etbscreenwriting.com Posted by Laurie Hutzler | September 28 2009 at 0905 AM Just saw the movie thought it was very good. Soderbergh is such an interesting director always saying I do one big project for them so I can do one small one for myself and even though this has the still underrated Matt Damon it feels like a real Soderbergh creation. Not Oceans 11 and not The Girlfriend Experience but still closer to the indie than the blockbuster. I love your observation of Damons approach to the film ""like a character man stepping up to a leading role"" and thats so true Damon has the unusual power to self-medicate his star power to levels of his choosing. And seeing Tony Hale was gravy. Whens that Arrested Development movie coming out Michael Cera.... Posted by Tyler | September 21 2009 at 1038 AM Good review thanks. I have heard a lot of really good things about this movie. I am looking forward to seeing it. I am very impressed with Matt Damon. His roles are becoming so diverse. Who knows what he will do next. Posted by Chris R | September 18 2009 at 1124 AM funny you mentioned the Oscar speech analogy. Heard Soderbergh speak post screening at the DGA in L.A. Thursday night and that is exactly the direction he gave Damon for that scene. Posted by Stephen A. | September 18 2009 at 0136 AM The comments to this entry are closed.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet One of the many baffling wonders of Steven Soderberghs lively dark comedy The Informant is that thanks to a running voiceover its almost always clear whats going through the protagonists head--but that doesnt help viewers decode him or get any closer to him as a person. Even in high-stress situations his mental processes are a nervy hilarious babble of musings about polar-bear hunting techniques and poisonous butterflies. He seems a million miles away from his own life which helps explain how he makes such a profound yet fascinating mess of it. Screenwriter Scott Z. Burns (The Bourne Ultimatum) draws from Kurt Eichenwalds dense true-crime book The Informant for the story of biochemist Mark Whitacre the key witness in a price-fixing scandal centering on agricultural conglomerate ADM. As the story begins Whitacre (Matt Damon) tells his superiors that hes in contact with a Japanese whistle-blower who for a mere 10 million can expose the industrial saboteur in their midst and fix a production issue thats costing them 7 million a month. His story seems likely; surely such a nebbishy out-of-touch follower-type wouldnt have the stones or the imagination to concoct such a tale. But when the FBI investigates the sabotage Whitacre nervously distracts them with the promise of a massive price-fixing case. Two earnest FBI agents (Scott Bakula and Joel McHale) press Whitacre into service as a mole a role he embraces and resists by unpredictable turns leaving his frustrated handlers uncertain whether hes cooperating or not. That dichotomy expands into a vast rift as his secrets tumble out. While the details are fresh the story arc follows a standard pattern a cautionary tale of spiraling bad-faith decisions. But Soderbergh and Burns compensate by playing the story for wry laughs and adding an almost distracting variety of texture from the ugly period fashions to the bright 60s title fonts to a frisky bubbling Marvin Hamlisch score full of comedic cues. The goofy tone and a cast sprinkled with comedy ringers (Tom Smothers Patton Oswalt Paul F. Tompkins) hint that the film is headed down the rabbit hole well before Soderbergh stops playing it straight. Not all the bells and whistles are necessary--Whitacres real-life deceptions were amazing enough to trump any spritely embellishment--but The Informant chooses to earn its exclamation point with giggles as well as shock and the results are thoroughly entertaining.

Loosely based on one of those true stories thats wilder than fiction it presents Damon (who gained 30 pounds for the role) as the real-life Mark Whitacre a research chemist who was rising rapidly through the executive ranks at the agribiz giant Archer Daniels Midland in the early 90s. When he blames production problems on sabotage by a Japanese competitor demanding a 10 million extortion payment ADM calls in the FBI and orders Whitacre to cooperate. Does he ever volunteering to a pair of flabbergasted special agents (Scott Bakula Joel McHale) that ADM has engaged in a massive price-fixing conspiracy with competitors around the world. Whitacre readily agrees to wear a recording device to tape incriminating meetings and begins calling himself ""Agent 0014"" because hes twice as smart as James Bond. When the indictments come down after a couple of years the FBI agents learn Whitacres also 10 times as crooked. Hes squirreled away millions of ill-gotten dollars in accounts around the world even as he kept assuring the FBI that ""Im one of the good guys."" Seriously delusional and quite possibly bipolar Whitacre hopes to take over as CEO of ADM when his bosses are busted. The tipoff that Whitacre is not the hero he presents himself is in the titles exclamation point as well as his rambling free-associative narration that frequently veers from the story line into his personal obsessions including his collection of sports cars. And then theres the infectious 60s-style score by Marvin Hamlisch which at times appears to recycle bits and pieces of music from his two Woody Allen movies ""Take the Money and Run"" and ""Bananas."" Damon shows terrific bravado in the lead role leading us through a tricky script by Scott Burns (""The Bourne Ultimatum"") based on a book by New York Times investigative reporter Kurt Eichenwald. Melanie Lynskey does well with the challenge of playing Whitacres oblivious wife who never questions his wild assertions and who we are told was waiting for him after he served nine years in prison. ""The Informant"" is more amusing than laugh-out-loud hilarious but is never boring. Its certainly a lot more fun and entertaining than Soderberghs last two films the deadly serious ""Che"" and ""The Girlfiend Experience."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Dirty Dancing town plans Swayze memorial Read Next Dirty Dancing town plans Swayze memorial Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 37904 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 19630 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16219 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"The Informant A different type of popcorn flick | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsOpinionThe Informant A different type of popcorn flickAstute followers of Steven Soderbergh learn to be wary of the directors zanier instincts.Matt Damon delivers comedic gold as a corn-fed federal whistleblower. The Steven Soderbergh film is adapted from an incredible but true story.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 18 2009 The Informant (out of 4) Starring Matt Damon Scott Bakula Joel McHale and Melanie Lynskey. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. 108 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Astute followers of Steven Soderbergh learn to be wary of the directors zanier instincts.In the past 18 months hes given us a movie about a call girl (The Girlfriend Experience) that contained no sex and two movies about Che Guevara (Che Parts 1 and 2) that examined the late rebels boots closer than it did the man himself. Results were mixed to put it mildly but Soderbergh gets full points for moxie.So word that his new film The Informant is a whistleblower drama that plays like cracked satire - check that exclamation mark in the title - should be cause for at least one raised eyebrow by anyone contemplating Soderbergh this weekend.Heres the good news his instincts are spot on this time. In adapting reporter Kurt Eichenwalds non-fiction account of Mark E. Whitacre the corporate corn husker turned federal snitch Soderbergh has given this incredible story exactly the amount of insanity it deserves. Matt Damon added 30 pounds bad hair and an Alfred E. Neuman smile to play Whitacre and he got it exactly right too.From 1989 to 1995 Whitacre was president of Archer Daniels Midlands Bioproducts Division a U.S. corn derivatives firm where as Damons voiceover explains ""corn goes in one end and profit comes out the other.""Just about everything people consume these days has a little corn in it which makes the grain and its by-products not only in high demand but also subject to price-fixing which is supposed to be illegal. Therein stands the tallest stalk of this cornfield but Whitacre made it a whole lot more than that. He led corporate weasels and credulous FBI agents on a merry chase that turned out a lot differently than anyone had expected going in.You can Google the details if you want but theyre really beside the point. What Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns are really interested in and what they riff on with the help of a hilariously retro Marvin Hamlisch soundtrack is not the ""why"" of Whitacres actions but rather the ""what"" of them.Heres an Ivy League-educated guy earning more than 350000 per year who seems to fancy himself to be either James Bond or the hero of a Michael Crichton novel. He doesnt immediately volunteer to be a whistleblower - his wife Ginger (Melanie Lynskey) bullies him into it - but once hes made the decision to do so he approaches the task with patriotic fervour and almost too much devotion to detail.Hes a dream witness for the FBIs Brian Shepard (Scott Bakula) and Bob Herndon (Joel McHale) two just-the-facts-maam special agents who think theyve hit the jackpot. (Maybe they did Whitacre was and remains the highest-ranking corporate official in U.S. history ever to sound the alarm against his own company.)What Shepard and Herndon slowly realize although viewers of The Informant glom onto it almost immediately is that Whitacre is not only an unreliable narrator he might be a downright crazy or sinister one.""Might"" is the operative word. Much of what happens is true both in the historical and dramatic sense but like the debatable lie detector seen in the film you cant always trust what you see or hear. Theres a lot of info left over that leaves us feeling uneasy possessed of the same furrowed brows as Shepard and Herndon. Whitacre maintains an interior monologue whereby everything from polar bear fishing techniques to killer South American butterflies enter his fevered noggin and you begin to wonder where exactly international price-fixing conspiracies and millions of dollars in embezzled funds rank in his skewed view of the world.Fortunately neither Soderbergh nor Burns want us to take it too seriously and to further underline the point theyve conscripted a few genuine comedians in cameos including both of the Smothers Brothers Tom and Dick. But the real humour comes from watching Damon in a role that should be remembered when the gold is being handed out.Justice may not be entirely served by The Informant but it is certainly amused by it.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The production is modest in physical scale mostly reserved in tone and touchingly simple in design (apart from Fannys dazzling wardrobe which is justified by her gifts as a seamstress). Yet the effect is exhilarating and deeply pleasurable. Its like the dive into a lake that Keats evokes to explain the experience of poetry. The point he explains to Fanny is not to get to the other side but to luxuriate in the lake. ENLARGE Abbie Cornish plays Fanny Brawne in Bright Star. Pathe Films/Everett Collection The most obvious source of pleasure is the films heroine about whom much has been written in the past two centuries despite a scarcity of factual knowledge. Whats never been in doubt is the depth of the poets passion for Fanny; his love letters to her enjoy a special place in English literature. What we know about her though comes mainly from him and its more suggestive than definitive. His first impression that of a stylish minx gave way to adoration for a woman who he said could ""concentrate my whole senses."" Not a blank slate then but one with plenty of open spaces that Ms. Campion has filled in the course of a film that avoids any trace of musty reverence for a long-dead poet by concentrating our senses on the breathtaking girl next door. In an earlier time this protofeminist creation might have been played by Katharine Hepburn. Happily for us shes played by Abbie Cornish the Australian actress who as I said in my Telluride preview last week is as luminous as the star of the lyric poem written by Keats for Fanny that gives the film its title. Ms. Cornishs beauty is very much a part of the attraction since her character is a shameless vivacious flirt. (Watch her upstage a bedroom full of butterflies.) But so is her quick intelligence and her ease with heightened language for this version of Fanny Brawne is something of an artist in her own right--a fashion designer before the term was coined--and something of an intellectual albeit undeclared even to herself. If Fanny cant fathom the depths of Keatss writing at first--""Poems"" she declares ""are a strain to work out""--she is eager and abundantly able to learn. If she cant understand his sexual reticence--to which he alludes with welcome brevity by saying ""Im not sure I have the right feelings toward women""--she loves him for the ardent and anguished man he is as well as for his still-controversial literary gifts. This is not after all the immortal Keats studied in books but John Keats an impoverished and all-too-mortal writer who has contracted tuberculosis and is soon to die at the age of 25. Hes played by Ben Whishaw who in his own artful tactful way matches Abbie Cornishs vivacity with a delicacy that conceals a soaring spirit. ""Theres a holiness to the hearts affection"" Keats says angrily to his Scottish friend Charles Brown who has mocked Fanny by sending her a flirtatious valentine. The line is a tricky one its pitfall being sanctimoniousness but Mr. Whishaw delivers it with an understated urgency that colors every moment of his beautiful performance. Tact isnt Charles Browns style. Thanks to an inspired stroke of casting hes portrayed by the American actor Paul Schneider who makes him an enormously entertaining boor not to mention a hostile supercilious clown dedicated to dominating Keatss life in the name of protecting him from such distractions as Fannys love. In a film distinguished by--though never encumbered by--exquisite taste Mr. Schneiders raunchy rambunctiousness is a tonic. The Informant More often than not the extensive use of voice-over narrative means the filmmakers didnt know how to dramatize their story without it. That seems to be true of ""The Informant"" but in an unusual way. Matt Damons voice-over is the movies main strength. Mr. Damon stars as Mark Whitacre a real-life biochemist who in the 1990s became a whistle-blower at the real-life agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland. Among Whitacres many charges was a multinational scheme to fix the price of lysine an amino acid used as an animal-feed additive. Some of those charges were valid but others werent and Whitacres handlers at the FBI as well as prosecutors at the Department of Justice had a terrible time sorting it all out after their endlessly cooperative witness proved to be a bipolar personality given to whopping lies and a crook whod embezzled at least 9 million of ADMs money. ENLARGE Matt Damon has the title role in The Informant Warner Bros. Pictures The movie directed by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Scott Z. Burns is an extended comic riff on ""The Informant (A True Story)"" a book by Kurt Eichenwald. Its overextended and exhaustingly comic with a score by Marvin Hamlisch--vaudeville music circus music Spike Jones-ish music anachronistically effervescent music from the 1950s--thats the musical equivalent of a hundred bruising pokes in the ribs. Mr. Damon plays it admirably straight for the most part thereby serving as a counterweight to the clamorous self-delight that surrounds him. Unfortunately thats not enough to save the production which lacks a clear approach to its heros befuddling lack of clarity. What does prove amusing though is the voice-over stream of Whitacres consciousness an impulsive meditation on whether his cars marque is pronounced Porsh-uh or Porsh; a spontaneous tribute to his hands (""I think theyre my favorite part of my body""); a self-congratulatory assessment of his time-saving habits (""Ill even floss in the shower while the conditioner is in my hair""); a speculation on whether polar bears know that their noses are black. One of the films producers George Clooney directed a 2002 film called ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."" These are revelations of an addled mind and theyre as fascinating as they are funny. Paris The French writer-director Cedric Klapisch makes fiction films that are better than most documentaries at tracking the ravages and felicities of urban renewal the connections between people and their neighborhoods the ties that both bind and torment families. In his latest feature ""Paris"" he does all of that and then some. ""Paris"" sees life--on earth not just in La Ville Lumiere--as a dance of human connections some of which fail while others endure. Thats equally the case with the film whose central character a professional dancer named Pierre (Romain Duris) is terrified to find himself afflicted by possibly terminal heart disease. Some connections are less vivid than others a few vignettes fail to thrive. As a whole though ""Paris"" pulses with a contemporary version of the energy that animated Balzacs novels or Colettes accounts of the life she observed from the window of her apartment in the Palais Royal. (It also pulses to a sensationally eclectic score.) ENLARGE Arthur Dujardin Marie Drion and Iris Grillet play the children of Juliette Binoche in Paris. FC Films Pierre is an attentive observer too but the movie takes a longer and wider view than he can command from his upstairs window on the world or during his cautious meanderings through the streets. It finds specific connecting points--a text message on a mobile phone an avocado in a produce warehouse--between would-be lovers and lovers-to-be. Pierres sister Elise (the ever-enchanting Juliette Binoche) does more than flirt with a fishmonger at an open-air market. A renowned historian turned TV host Roland (Fabrice Luchini) stalks a beautiful student with startling results. (""Im really not a Machiavellian pervert"" he insists during their first meeting.) Rolands architect brother Philippe (Francois Cluzet) dreams a dream--a stunning set piece within the film--of designing a perfect neighborhood populated by perfectly normal people. Refreshingly no one is normal in ""Paris""--no one even comes close. Mr. Klapischs special gift is to populate his films with perfectly grounded eccentrics who use perfectly ordinary words to express poetic ideas. One of those ideas is the ceaseless tension between old and new in the evolution of cities and one of the characters who obliquely expresses it is the cabbie who takes Pierre to the hospital for an operation that will save or end his life. ""Richard-Lenoir is jammed"" the cabbie says invoking both a boulevard and French history without thinking of it then rattling off a string of alternate routes and hallowed names that include Bastille and Voltaire. The modern Paris of ""Paris"" lives in an ever-present past. (After its theatrical opening the film will be available nationally via IFCs video on demand.) DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Lars and the Real Girl (2007) Paul Schneider is Gus the older brother of Lars who is played by Ryan Gosling. Its Mr. Goslings movie he gives a one-of-a-kind performance as a likable but withdrawn young man who buys a life-size sex doll on the Internet and falls in love with it. Still Mr. Schneider rings witty changes on his characters obtuseness his skepticism--Gus is our surrogate in all of this goofiness--his verbal contortions buried guilt and essential decency. Craig Gillespie directed from Nancy Olivers gentle searching script. Of all the unfashionable things in our day and age this is a movie about kindness. ENLARGE The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) Matt Damon plays another compulsive liar in the late Anthony Minghellas intensely atmospheric yet ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel of the same name. The year is 1958 and the place is Italy where rich young Americans play expatriate games aboard yachts on azure seas or dart through ancient hill towns on sputtering Vespas and Lambrettas. Mr. Damon gives a remarkable performance as the endlessly needy and mendacious Tom Ripley and hes surrounded by a splendid cast that includes Cate Blanchett Jude Law Philip Seymour Hoffman and radiant in a negligible role Gwyneth Paltrow. Gabriel Yared did the lovely score. ENLARGE A Family Resemblance (1996) If any imperfections mar Cedric Klapischs feature (""Un Air de Famille"" in its original French) youll have to find out about them elsewhere. I think this chamber piece adapted from a play by Agnes Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri is flawless. The filmmakers subject is the family romance in all its anguish; theres even a dysfunctional dog named Caruso and a charming discussion of whether Caruso knows he cant walk. The last time I looked the video transfer seemed abysmal an almost total betrayal of Benoit Delhommes burnished cinematography. Yet the film transcends the shabby treatment; its well worth the price of a rental. Find television listings at LocateTV.

"The Informant - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Steven SoderberghMOVIE REVIEW The InformantSteven Soderbergh makes another exasperating film largely for himself.September 18 2009|KENNETH TURAN | FILM CRITIC The exclamation point at the end of ""The Informant"" gives it all away. While the title may promise a straight-ahead drama that bit of faux-jaunty emphasis shows that nothing of the sort is going on. Which is business as usual these days when Steven Soderbergh is the director.Soderbergh who won an Oscar for directing ""Traffic"" and was nominated for ""Erin Brockovich"" in the same year is a filmmaker as exasperating as he is gifted. And not just when he forsakes calculated crowd pleasers like ""Oceans Eleven"" for doodles like ""Bubble.""Just as there are studio executives who can so the line goes turn a go project into a development deal Soderberghs apparent resolve to tell interesting stories in uninteresting ways has given his recent work a distinct anti-audience bias. ""The Good German"" was committed to solving technical challenges at the expense of drama and ""Che"" was determined to tell a dramatic story in the most tedious manner.Like these ""The Informant"" was made by Soderbergh largely to amuse himself. He read a story about a real-life corporate whistle-blower and decided for reasons only he knows that it had the makings of a wacky comedy starring an overweight Matt Damon. The result not unlike those sounds only dogs can hear is not the most promising way to involve people outside the directors inner circle.This lack of success is not for lack of trying. Damon does his best to make corporate executive Mark Whitacre a person of interest but as conceptualized by Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns (working from a book by Kurt Eichenwald) Whitacre is not anyone you enjoy spending time with.Whitacre is introduced as an energetic young executive for agribusiness colossus Archer Daniels Midland circa 1992 working in the Decatur Ill. world headquarters and in charge of an ADM plant thats manufacturing a hot new food additive called lysine. When a persistent virus threatens production Whitacre tells his boss Mick Andreas (Tom Papa) that the Japanese have been sabotaging things but are willing to back off for a price.Andreas and an understandably concerned ADM security chief Mark Cheviron (Tom Wilson) call in the FBI. Whitacre is spooked at first but at the prompting of his wife Ginger (Melanie Lynskey) he uses this as an opportunity to clear his conscience.ADM he tells surprised straight-arrow FBI Special Agent Brian Shepard (Scott Bakula) has been engaged in price-fixing for lysine on an international scale. Because he is a good guy who wants to do whats right Whitacre agrees to wear a wire and help make the case against his co-workers.This sounds straightforward enough but not the way ""The Informant"" tells it. A decision has been made to reveal via extensive use of voice-over the stream of consciousness passing through Whitacres head while this drama is taking place. Its apparent almost at once that the man is a motor mind with little control over his thoughts an ultimate loose cannon who simply cannot focus and who hates hates hates to tell a straight-line story.The problem with this creative decision is twofold the most obvious being that the thoughts going through Whitacres mind whether they concern merino wool or the price of ties are of negligible interest. Its a trial to be inside his mind for five minutes let alone the nearly two hours of the films running time.More significantly the nature of the voice-over clues us in from the start that Whitacre is the most unreliable of characters so later ""revelations"" about him do not feel that shocking or even revealing. If theres comedy to be found in this gap between talk and action ""The Informant"" has not located it. While this film fits squarely into Soderberghs recurrent goal of ignoring audience interest when possible thats the only area in which it can be considered a success.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--The InformantMPAA rating R for languageRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESInformant star goes back to his rootsSeptember 17 2009The jokes on The InformantSeptember 13 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTSteven SoderberghLysineMark WhitacreInformantCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-informant18-2009sep18,0,1878863.story",200,theinformant19,theinformant,latimes

""Hes making three hundred and fifty grand a year and he turns informer. When does that happen?"" Thats the mystery of Steven Soderberghs ""The Informant"" a smart silly corporate crime comedy. Its an absurd but true story that plays like a gag reel from Soderberghs socially conscious ""Erin Brockovich."" Mark Whitacre was a star executive at agri-giant Archer Daniels Midland who tattled on the companys vast international price-fixing scheme. He smuggled a wire into hundreds of meetings in the 1990s securing the kind of direct evidence of white-collar conspiracy that prosecutors dream about. Asked why Whitacre (porky dorky Matt Damon) gets self-righteous huffing ""Things are going on I dont approve of."" Hooey. The film -- stylishly scripted by Golden Valley native Scott Z. Burns (""The Bourne Ultimatum"") -- wisely leaves Whitacres motivations unresolved. He probably didnt understand them himself; hes not the type to ruminate. But Soderberghs portrait of his life is a detailed report on beige bourgeois banality. His life is conventional comfortable (nice wife nice kids nice house) and entirely adventure-free. Naturally Mark wanted to escape. He was bored stiff. And beneath his bland exterior a little bit nuts. So when he meets a pair of poker-faced FBI agents (Scott Bakula and Joel McHale) investigating a report of sabotage his eyes spark with childlike enthusiasm. The dumpy manager imagines himself a superspy living a secret life of danger and intrigue. Whitacre throws himself into his assignments with the unfocused energy of a big lovable mutt jeopardizing the sting time and again. He shows his briefcase/recorder to his groundskeeper bragging that hes code-named 0014 because hes ""twice as smart as 007."" But his mind wanders during crucial events -- hilarious stream-of-consciousness monologues drifting to thoughts of polar bears and the most efficient use of shower time. His scrambled thoughts raise suspicions He seems to believe what hes saying but should we? THE INFORMANT  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for language. The films casting is spot on. Damon is delightful playing someone who is a terrible actor. Wearing a ghastly muffin-shaped hairdo an ill-advised mustache and 30 extra pounds around his waist hes hardly recognizable as lethal Jason Bourne. Soderbergh keeps the tone light even in detail-dense scenes by casting scores of comedians to underplay straight roles. Patton Oswalt is an exasperated fed; Tom Smothers plays ADM honcho Dwayne Andreas; his brother Dick plays a judge trying to make sense of the lunatic court case. Soderberghs knack for tumultuous stories shines here. Burns script lays down just enough information to keep us on track and ready for the next surprise. And it drills deeper into the mysteries of human nature than most business thrillers which typically build to a preordained conclusion -- criminality is a natural outgrowth of competitive corporate life. ""The Informant"" demolishes such tidy resolutions. The further we delve into the case the more elusive the truth appears and the weirder the antiheros motives. Whitacres increasingly peculiar behavior insinuates that some people just come off the assembly line aberrant. ""The Informant"" leaves a joshing worrisome implication hanging in the air No matter how many snitches and spies we employ well never exterminate folly. Fact is well probably never understand it.

Pictures Matt Damon takes on a weighty humorous role in The Informant. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Informant   (out of four) Stars Matt Damon Melanie Lynskey Scott Bakula Joel McHaleDirector Steven SoderberghDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for languageRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY People magazine may just strip Matt Damon of his ""sexiest man alive"" title once they catch sight of the actor in the offbeat film The Informant. Portly -- Damon packed on 30 pounds for the role -- and sporting a ridiculous mustache dorky wire-framed glasses and an unmoving helmet of hair hes almost unrecognizable in the role of Mark Whitacre a corporate whistle-blower who is not what he seems. Damon is superb as a demonically smart guy who comes across as rather dim. The Informant is an odd satirical comedy that director Steven Soderbergh has infused with a jaunty tone in contrast to the serious subject matter. Its story of corporate malfeasance and corruption as well as individual greed couldnt be more timely given the antics of bailed-out Wall Street companies and powerhouse banks. The dark comedy is based on the real-life much-publicized story of the highest-ranking corporate whistle-blower in American history. Its the early 1990s and Whitacre is a top exec at Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) an agri-industry conglomerate engaging in an industry-wide practice of price-fixing. Why would Whitacre sabotage his golden-boy status by revealing his companys wrongdoings? At first he seems like an inept but heroic guy fessing up to the FBI and exposing his companys illegal acts because its the right thing to do. Soon it becomes clear that his motives are more ulterior than pure of heart. The FBI agents assigned to the case (Scott Bakula and Joel McHale) find that Whitacres account of events shifts more easily than his toupee in a strong breeze. Is Whitacre a knight in shining armor a compulsive liar playing secret agent or plagued by mental illness? Or is he all of the above? With his earnest demeanor and straightforward delivery Damon convincingly obfuscates Whitacres motives. We dont question his veracity as much as try to muddle through it. A big part of the fun is piecing together the puzzle that is Whitacre. In a strange but fascinating touch Damon voices his inner monologue. Often his thoughts -- an inane stream of consciousness -- seem wholly unrelated to whats going on around him which adds an intriguing absurdist quality to an already quirky tale. We come to realize Whitacre is the least reliable narrator in an already slippery setting. Soderbergh takes a deadly serious news story and amplifies and colors it to the point of outrageousness. The results arent always consistent but they are undeniably compelling. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

But his movies can be very hard to like. Hes a little like that annoying kid back in school the one waving his hand in the air at every question shouting ""Ooh Ooh"" Soderberghs films are a little cocky a little cold a little show-offy much like his own first screen hero the silky voyeur played by James Spader in ""Sex Lies and Videotape."" The Informant (R) Warner Bros. (105 min.) Directed by Steven Soderbergh. With Matt Damon Scott Bakula Melanie Lynskey. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains strong language. His new film the comedy ""The Informant"" is proof. There was a time at the start of the decade when Soderbergh seemed to relax turning out a string of pictures -- ""Out of Sight"" ""The Limey"" ""Erin Brockovich"" ""Traffic"" and ""Oceans Eleven"" -- that were smart without being superior. But lately hes been on a cold streak. This years ""The Girlfriend Experience"" looked inside the heart and head of a call girl -- and found nothing. Last years ""Che"" was technically and stylistically impressive but in pursuit of its own perfect structure it willfully ignored the guerrillas darkest days. ""The Informant"" is similarly off-putting. Based on a true corporate scandal its a story of agribusiness price-fixing and Mark Whitacre the one executive who decided to tell the truth. Unfortunately he also turned out to have a rather flexible idea of what the truth was. Its a pretty dramatic tale but having already done the crusading do-gooder in ""Erin Brockovich"" Soderbergh obviously wanted to take a different approach. So instead hes shot the entire thing as a campy comedy complete with groovy titles and a swingin score by Marvin Hamlisch. The only problem is ""The Informant"" is not very funny. Not certainly in real life (in which the whistleblower had a breakdown and attempted suicide). And not onscreen either where Soderbergh -- never our lightest of filmmakers -- spends far too much energy smirking at the characters bad toupee and ugly ties. Its a smugly hip Im-smarter-than-you stance poking fun at characters for their clothing choices or turning up the ""funny"" music to tell you when to laugh (since youd never figure it out for yourself). It doesnt work to put it mildly. Much better and genuinely smart is the script by Scott Z. Burns which dramatizes a new world in which as one executive explains its the consumer whos the enemy not the competitor. It also does a wonderful job of taking us right inside Whitacres cluttered mind. Thats because Whitacres a talker and he talks to us in voiceover from beginning to end. But its a stream-of-consciousness ramble as Whitacre tunes out conversations to tell us about a recent business trip or the wisdom to be gleaned from John Grisham. Thats a witty touch. Wise too is the performance of Matt Damon as Whitacre. Plumped up with extra weight ping-ponging between reckless confidence and paralyzing fear hes like an overgrown 11-year-old and he makes the characters mix of excitement (Im working for the FBI) and terror (and Im going to get caught) absolutely real. The rest of the cast is fine (particularly Melanie Lynskey as Whitacres long-suffering wife and Scott Bakula as a straighter-than-straight-arrow FBI man). And while Hamlischs score overwhelms the movie its clearly what Soderbergh wanted an expert pastiche of studio hack work complete with twangy spy-movie and rollicking country-music cues. But like its movie like its director and ultimately like Whitacre himself ""The Informant"" is too clever by half -- and yet at the same time not quite as smart as it thinks.

BOTTOM LINE What do you call a drama pretending to be a comedy? Unfunny. Damon however is almost worth the ticket price. CAST Matt Damon Scott Bakula Melanie Lynskey LENGTH 145 Steven Soderberghs ""The Informant"" tells the true story of a corporate whistle-blower but is intriguingly pitched as a comedy. You can tell by the exclamation point in the title a clear nod to classic Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker spoofs like ""Airplane"" and ""Top Secret"" Kurt Eichenwalds 1998 book ""The Informant"" has been milked for humor before NPRs ""This American Life"" told a wry version in 2000. The story is a doozy In 1992 Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon) an executive at the agribusiness behemoth Archer Daniels Midland told the FBI about a global conspiracy to fix prices on a food additive called lysine. Whitacre a family man living in Decatur Ill. not only agrees to wear a wire but becomes an astoundingly talented double agent nimbly leading his colleagues into self-incrimination. As it turns out though Whitacre is leading a triple or even a quadruple life and his many deceptions (and delusions) nearly undermine the biggest price-fixing case in history. advertisement | advertise on newsday Damon sporting a wonderfully unflattering mustache and an extra 30 pounds is terrific as the fast-talking Whitacre; his inner chaos seems hidden even from himself. The fine supporting cast includes television veteran Scott Bakula as a long-suffering FBI agent and Melanie Lynskey (""Away We Go"") as Whitacres even-longer-suffering wife. Several comedians including Tom and Dick Smothers show up in small roles. But Soderbergh despite three lighthearted ""Oceans"" films is not a natural comedic director. His biggest attempt at levity is hiring old-school composer Marvin Hamlisch (""The Sting"" Woody Allens ""Bananas"") whose score includes chirpy flutes cheeky brass and kazoos - very Benny Hill. Meanwhile Whitacres bizarre free-associative monologues do little more than fill the dead spaces. MoviesTrailer The Informant Ultimately it wouldnt have taken much to fashion ""The Informant"" into a perfectly workable drama. Step one Remove that exclamation point.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Claudette Barius) B The Informant Genre Comedy Drama; Starring Melanie Lynskey Matt Damon Scott Bakula; Director Steven Soderbergh; Author Scott Z. Burns; Release Date Wide 09/18/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 108; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted September 16 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT Punctuation promises comedy in The Informant as if the title subject is a cartoon secret agent -- maybe Agent 86 in Get Smart. But hes not. The whistle-blower worthy of an exclamation point in this groovy-looking chuckle-baiting fact-based movie from protean director Steven Soderbergh is Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon) a biochemist and well-placed executive at the agri-processing giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) in Decatur Ill. Its the early 1990s. The company man is helping expose ADMs alleged global price-fixing activities to the FBI cooperating with the feds long enough to gather invaluable evidence. But what Whitacre doesnt confide to his FBI handlers and what his wheat-colored jackets Dilbert ties and weakling mustache hide at least at first is that this inside source is not completely trustworthy. Damon fattened up to fit his boxy suits wears Whitacres slack demeanor beautifully. The star -- who has quietly and steadily turned into a great Everyman actor -- is in nimble control as he reveals his characters deep crazies. Soderberghs amused study of the highest-ranking corporate whistleblower in U.S. history is adapted from The Informant A True Story an amazing deeply reported book by New York Times reporter Kurt Eichenwald. That book told the story without editorial eye-rolling. But somewhere between Eichenwalds journalistic attention ? to detail and the bubbly dialogue-?besotted script by The Bourne Ultimatums Scott Z. Burns Soderbergh has ? chosen to apply an attitude of arch whoopee a greasy veneer of mirth over what is no joke a serious mess of malfeasance and mental instability. Its tempting to laugh but whats ? the joke Whitacre? ADM? The FBI? ? The fashion trends of Decatur? Smarty condescension lurks behind the suburban bushes. Had a 90s date and place card not been supplied I would have remained in an honest muddle about the era depicted on screen. And since Whitacre is subliminally likened to bumbling fictional Maxwell Smart thats probably as the filmmaker intended. The artistic choice is reinforced by a 70s-era ? Laugh-In aesthetic seen in everything from the smiley yellow novelty ? typography of the opening credits to the fancy rubber-chicken music served up in heaps of horns and whistles by essence-of-70s composer Marvin Hamlisch. Sock it to me. Playing it straight and letting his Sam-?Donaldson-meets-Spock hairdo suggest ? otherwise Scott Bakula makes an appealing FBI agent with a deadpan grimace just this side -- or maybe its the other side -- of Dragnets Joe Friday. Comedian Joel McHale from Es The Soup plays the fellow agent who stares with big round eyes while his partner squints at Whitacres successive leakages of truth/lie/ truth/lie. The always wonderful huggable ? Melanie Lynskey who stole the show in Away We Go does more great wifely work as Ginger Whitacre her husbands biggest booster. A valued subset of Soderberghs audience is sure to dig iconic hipster comic brothers Tom and Dick Smothers in small roles. In fact the wily pair would fit right in with an Oceans Whatever cast of coolios enjoying some retro-style ensemble fun regardless of whether the audience does. Soderbergh is as smart stylish and ? attentive a filmmaker as they come. And there are moments in The Informant when I can ? almost be convinced that the tonal feints he ? establishes at the intersection of joke and no-joke are seriously thoughtfully meant to replicate the misaligned synapses in Whitacres own head. But if thats the intention Soderbergh ? ultimately made the choice to abandon interesting dispassionate empathy for the more quick-fix payoff of amusement. As Whitacre goes through his days Damon recites interior monologues of distracted observation in voice-overs meant to demonstrate how his characters unusual brain works. In The Informant that brain -- screwy and yet capable of doing important undercover work -- free-associates like Ellen DeGeneres on a swing through ? Walmart. Cute but as even Agent 86 would say in Get Smart Missed it by that much.

"The Informant movie review by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review The Informant -- 3 out of 5 stars Scott Bakula Joel McHale and Matt Damon Warner Bros. Warner Bros. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic If only The Informant was as giddy as its exclamation-point title as jaunty as its corporate Muzak soundtrack -- or even as funny as its TV commercials.Informant is The Insider played for laughs The Talented Mr. Ripley without the murder. This jaw-dropping corporate farce is built around a zany Matt Damon performance as a guy who blew the whistle on agri-business giant Archer Daniels Midland a company where ""corn goes in one end and money comes out the other."" ADM was accused of conspiring with its competitors around the world in ""fixing"" the prices of commodities. The guy the government learns about this from could be their dream ""mole"" or a prosecutors nightmare. Mark Whitacre (Damon) is an ADM division chief when we meet him in 1992 a bio-chemist trying to get a new production line running. Things arent working out. When he yells ""Sabotage"" ADM gets the FBI involved. And thats when Whitacre spills. The agents ( Scott Bakula Joel McHale) are incredulous at his tale of fraud.""Everyone in this country is a victim of a corporate crime by the time theyve finished breakfast""But this Whitacre guy with his many cars the stables hes building across the street -- can they trust him? Hes outraged by ADMs behavior morally compelled to out them. As he wears ""a wire"" and goofily stage-manages his work as ""0014 because Im twice as smart as 007"" he will blow the whistle on why worldwide prices of corn-based products rise in unison. Damon and his Oceans Eleven director Steven Soderbergh team up for this ""true"" ""caper"" picture with Damon playing Whitacre as a guy whose inner life is a blizzard of random thoughts -- about the kinky stuff they sell in Tokyos Ginza shopping district the goofy Feds who dont treat him like Tom Cruise -- ""Didnt these people see The Firm?""Soderbergh plays this story straight relying on the amateurish silliness of Whitacre and the tales escalating absurdity to deliver laughs. He never quite nails the tone and even toys with stunt casting (both Smothers Brothers have bit parts).The Informant never finds the ring-ding-ding of the last Oceans movie. Its surreal but no laugh riot because who can giggle when youre slack-jawed at the chutzpah of it all?The InformantThree of five stars Cast Matt Damon Scott Bakula Melanie LynskeyDirector Steven SoderberghRunning time 1 hour 45 minutesIndustry rating R for language.

The Informant Good Director Steven Soderbergh. Cast Matt Damon Scott Bakula Joel McHale. Rating R for language. Related FBI agents story comes to big screen Qamp;A Steven Soderbergh Damon turns Informant on pre-Bourne career fears Spotlight Matt Damon Toronto film fest Naturally its based on a true story. Matt Damon beefed up and doughy is outstanding as Mark Whitacre a troubled high-ranking executive at food-industry giant Archer Daniels Midland who in the early 1990s provided damning information on the companys price-fixing practices (which he also participated in). Director Steven Soderbergh expertly builds the story layer upon layer; what appears to be a simple case of a whistleblower becomes a comedy of lies and delusion with emphasis on comedy. The story is much more complex than it seems in part because of the byzantine nature of corporate price-fixing in larger part because Whitacre himself is such a bizarre complicated fellow. Hes a brilliant man loves his family and his job. But a lot is going on beneath the wonkish exterior. Whitacre tells his bosses that a mole is tipping off Japanese competitors about his companys work on lysine an animal-feed additive the company couldnt get to work right. The FBI is called in; agent Brian Shepard (Scott Bakula) stops by Whitacres enormous home to tap his phone line so investigators can listen in on the next call from Japan. Whitacre is happily compliant - and then his wife Ginger (Melanie Lynskey) demands that he tell Shepard everything. Say what? Reluctantly at first then enthusiastically Whitacre begins spilling details about an enormous international price-fixing scheme that has ADM at its center. Shepard of course is intrigued. Will Whitacre wear a wire? Oh yeah. Whitacre jumps at the chance relishing the notion of playing spy. Shepard and his partner Robert Herndon (Joel McHale) are bemused by Whitacres zeal but also are under pressure from their superiors to make a case. It takes time; Whitacre tapes conversations and meetings for more than two years. Then things get really weird. The price-fixing is real. But the rest of Whitacres story - the rest of his life in fact - begins to spring leaks. Soderbergh treats the story with a genial amusement giving the film an off-kilter charm. Yes the story is based on fact but the directors perspective is skewed. The casting for instance is both bizarre and inspired. Bakula hasnt been this good since . . . well ever. Who would have thought of him for this role? McHale is host of ""The Soup"" on E and Tony Hale who plays one of Whitacres increasingly frustrated attorneys is best known as Buster from ""Arrested Development."" Even the Smothers brothers get in on the act with Tommy playing ADMs chairman and Dick playing a judge. Marvin Hamlisch has fun with a goofy score and Damon has a voiceover that occasionally explains whats going on but also veers off into funny non-sequiturs providing both laughs and a clue into the different way Whitacres mind works. Damon is the linchpin and hes fantastic. For the movie to work Whitacre has to be a sympathetic character. If we resent him or worse dislike him - and as the story unfolds that becomes more and more a possibility - theres nothing to care about. No worries. Damon mixes humor and self-delusion with ease which is no easy task. Along with Soderberghs generous sense of whimsy he keeps ""The Informant"" entertaining throughout.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - As evidenced by The Informant its a hell of a tricky thing turning real-life pulp into floss sugar. The story of Archer Daniels Midland biochemist-exec-turned-crooked-federal-snitch Mark Whitacre is a tragicomedy. Journalist Kurt Eichenwald spent five years trailing the bipolar fuck-up and his 2000 book The Informant is so densely richly packed with gut-wrenching what-the-what? revelations that its easy to speed through the 600-plus pages thinking its a novel. Which for some reason wasnt good enough for writer Scott Z. Burns and director Steven Soderbergh who frame their screen adaptation The Informant between quotation marks so they can giggle from a safe distance.Their conceit is made clear with the film-opening caveat which warns that yes while this may be a true story about Mark Whitacre--played here by Matt Damon beneath 30 pounds of pudge and a toupee--some names have been changed and some events have been collapsed ""so there."" And then the irony hits fast and hard the score by Marvin Hamlisch offering a 1970s best-of; the flat blindingly washed-out look shot in HD but borrowed from an episode of Dallas; the stunt casting of comics (Patton Oswalt The Soups Joel McHale Paul F. Tompkins the Smothers Brothers Tony Hale Rick Overton Allan Havey) in dead-serious roles; title cards whose font went out of style with shag carpet and um Marvin Hamlisch. Soderberghs sure got a lot of gimmicks--the mans working hard.Unlike the directors usual organic efforts--in which great style never results in overstylized--The Informant feels overamped from start to shrugging finish. (And this is from someone who defends Oceans Twelve as a Marx Brothers film directed by Jean-Pierre Melville.) The filmmakers have painted a 1990s story with a 1970s palette and the tone clashes with the setting like plaid on paisley.This is a shame because buried somewhere inside the bag of tricks is a thrilling heartbreaking breathtaking darkly comic tale about a deluded hustler and crackpot liar who decided to bring down one of the worlds most powerful companies just to cover his greed his ambition and his own sorry ass. Whitacre was a whistleblower absolutely but also far from a hero.In 1992 Whitacre was a golden boy at ADM with a big problem His attempts to create an amino acid by feeding corn to microbes were failing thanks to a virus in the vats. And so he blamed his troubles on corporate sabotage--from Japan like in Michael Crichtons Rising Sun hed often say--and wound up with the FBI tapping his home phone. Which led to his confession to the FBI that ADM officials were conspiring with competitors on a price-fixing scheme. Which led to his wearing a wire for three years. Which led to ADMs discovery that hed been embezzling millions. Which led to prison. For everyone.The outline of that tale remains--in Soderberghs version Whitacre is still the rising star who goes supernova all by his lonesome. But theres no drama in his rise and fall no tension no nothing except the nonsensical narration that Whitacre provides with a rambling inner monologue (""Guys in suits buying girls used panties . . ."") that grows increasingly paranoid the more in trouble he becomes.Truth is Whitacre is fortunate to get off with the filmmakers and Damons glib flabby pasted-on-smile caricature. Same goes for the ADM higher-ups often reduced to bit parts here. The other characters chief among them FBI Special Agents Brian Shepard (Scott Bakula beneath a thickly lacquered helmet of hair) and Robert Herndon (McHale) also get short shrift; itll take those who havent read the book forever to figure out whos who or why its worth the bother. Screenwriter Burns hasnt condensed the book so much as cut and paste from Eichenwalds tome a few pages here and there; its less a narrative than a highlights reel. (During a preview screening audience members were overheard asking neighbors ""Now whos that guy--an FBI agent or an Archer Daniels executive?"")Whitacres tale certainly warrants an absurdists touch but Soderbergh and Burns get mired in the middle ground somewhere between Michael Manns fist-shaking heart-pounding The Insider (likewise a whistleblowers tune) and Steven Spielbergs jazzy light-on-its-feet Catch Me If You Can (with a brief stopover to hang out with the Barbarians at the Gate). What they wound up with The Untalented Bespectacled Pudgy Toupee-Wearing Prevaricating Kinda Nutty Mr. Whitacre. Now whos conning whom?

The idea is to sell their new works to the European and North American markets and maybe get a whisper of Oscar buzz. Among this years frequent flyers are Werner Herzog in Venice with his Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans stars Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes and Michael Moore who brought along his Capitalism A Love Story star Michael Moore. George Clooney is a familiar figure at both festivals and in Venice this year he shared red-carpet photo ops with his Oceans Eleven (and Twelve and Thirteen) buddy Matt Damon. (See Steven Soderberghs big break in TIMEs top 10 Cannes moments.) Tonight the Oceans amigos are in different parts of Toronto Clooney with The Men Who Stare at Goats at the Ryerson Damon with The Informant in a Gala showing at Roy Thomson Hall. Both pictures are kind-of thrillers and sort-of comedies that are more or less based on semi-non-fiction books about spy-case events that in some form or other may have occurred. (Well get to Goats later this weekend in tandem with a second Clooney film Up in the Air.) Clooney always puts on a suave show but tonight at TIFF Damon has the posher venue and the better movie. (See TIMEs Fall Entertainment Preview.) In the early 90s Mark Whitacre (Damon) is president of the bio-chemicals division of the agro-giant Archer Daniels Midland. When the FBI launches an investigation into possible corporate espionage at ADM Whitacre volunteers the information that his bosses are colluding with other companies in fixing the price of the amino-acid lysine used to make the polyunsaturated corn oil in so many food-related products. ""Basically everyone is a victim of corporate crime before they finish breakfast"" Whitacre tells an FBI agent (Scott Bakula) who says ""Thats not a business meeting thats a crime scene."" Whitacre would become the highest-ranking businessman ever to blow the whistle on his own company and ADM would pay 500 million in penalties. Didnt they do this story a decade ago and call it The Insider? Yes but director Steven Soderbergh wanted The Informant to go somewhere else -- down the rabbit hole of Whitacres mystifying mind. He seems the sunniest symbol of corporate America and middle America smart pleasant undemonstrative with a supportive wife (Melanie Lynskey) and two kids. But we get the earliest glimpses of Marks gift for fooling people and perhaps himself in the movies voiceover in which Mark wanders blithely into logical cul-de-sacs and exotic trivia In Japan he notes there are vending machine where men buy the used undergarments of schoolgirls. What does that say about the Japanese? Or about Mark for fixating on it? The whole movie is Marks brain scan. Its shot and acted in a bland style that you only eventually realize is deeply askew and darkly corrosively satirical. The measured voices and pastel palette -- every location whether an ADM office a local restaurant or Whitacres home has the impersonal cheeriness of motel-room decor -- are reminiscent of some 70s game show produced by Chuck Barris complete with a perky score by Marvin Hamlisch. Then Whitacres story vortexes into deeper chicanery and possible derangement; and The Informant reveals itself as a cousin to Confessions of a Dangerous Mind the movie (directed by Clooney) that posited Barris as an assassin in the employ of the CIA. The key to The Informants subversive agenda is in that exclamation point it points you to responding by saying ""Ha"" or Huh?"" ""Huh?"" as in What game exactly is Whitacre playing? Whose side is he on? How much of what he or the film says is true? Those questions and the complexity of what may pass an answers juice up the entertainment value of The Informant The movie begins with a printed statement that while much of the action is fact-based certain characters and situations have been massaged for dramatic effect. This warning ends with a cheeky ""So there"" as if the filmmakers are sticking their tongue out at the gullibility of the ADM execs the FBI agents possibly Whitacre and for sure the audience. The film was written by Scott Z. Burns whose two most prominent credits -- as a producer of Al Gores An Inconvenient Truth and one of the scripters on Damons hit thriller The Bourne Ultimatum -- hint at The Informants mix of crusader fact and secret-agent fiction though neither of those films has this ones devious agenda. In the movie business Soderbergh is himself something of a double agent. Over the past decade five of the features hes directed -- the three Oceans films Traffic and Erin Brockovich -- have grossed more than 100 million domestic while seven others including The Good German (with Clooney) and Che have earned less than 5 million. His movies are either super-Hollywood or defiantly sometimes suicidally anti-Hollywood. On the box-office chart The Informant may end up closer to the non-starters. Its lunacy is too deadpan and its denouement too drawn out to appeal to those who liked the Bourne movies or for that matter the Gore. But its worth seeing and a salutary achievement. Hollywood is an industry that mostly ignores workplace life and the impact of corporations on what we eat and how we live. And on the rare occasions when it touches on these issues it looks to turn them into morality plays with easily recognizable heroes and villains (as Erin Brockovich did). The Informant says that people who do good or ill have complex motives for their actions and that not everyone is knowable instantly or ever. If we leave the movie wondering who its Mark Whitacre is that will be the right response not a ""Huh?"" but a muted ""Aha."" Matt Damon makes the list see TIMEs top 10 CIA movies.

By David Denby Matt Damon as a whistle-blower in Steven Soderberghs new movie.   Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell In Steven Soderberghs ""The Informant"" Matt Damon plays a corporate whistle-blower who almost swallows the whistle. Mark Whitacre (Damon) seems the epitome of Midwestern square. He wears a hairpiece that he must imagine makes him look virile--an overabundant pompadour. Damon gained thirty pounds for the role and hes paunchy and round-faced with a mustache and steel-rimmed glasses. This man is the hero or perhaps the antihero of a true story as reported by Kurt Eichenwald in his 2000 book of the same title (although unadorned by exclamation point). The movie opens in 1992 when Whitacre is the young president of the bio-products division at the agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland. He appears to be outraged that A.D.M. is fixing prices with its Japanese competitors for lysine--an amino acid that goes into the corn-based foods that fill the aisles of American supermarkets. At dinner he stares at his corn-fed chicken and pumped-up shrimp in disgust. Does he feel guilty about what hes doing to the American diet? About the inflation of prices? He says so but hes in on the fix and the F.B.I. which has been tapping his telephone is puzzled by him. In any case Whitacre naively excited agrees to wear a wire to meetings with his superiors and colleagues. He turns into a foolish risk-taker a kind of electrified dork who narrates into a tape recorder a stunningly undramatic entrance into the corporate headquarters in Decatur Illinois. He even fiddles with the balky machine while company executives sit all around him. He thinks that hes invulnerable like his idol Tom Cruise in ""The Firm."" Somehow no one at A.D.M. catches on to him and he gets results. But by degrees almost everything he says begins to sound false. One lie encases another and another. After five years the Justice Department having received hundreds of Whitacres tapes finds itself committed to a major price-fixing case against A.D.M. based on incriminating information sneaked to it by a man less reliable than a carnival barker. The government is stuck with him and so are we since weve earlier paid him respect and credit. ""The Informant"" is a return to form for Soderbergh who couldnt seem to put anything resembling an emotional charge into his recent films--the interminable depressive ""Che"" with Benicio Del Toro staring mournfully into the jungle and the inert ""The Girlfriend Experience"" in which the porn actress Sasha Grey was so wrapped in egotism that she forgot to give a performance. This time Soderbergh is in full control and his star is on fire. Usually chary of words Damon here is as voluble as a travelling salesman at a hotel bar and he holds nothing back never distancing himself from Whitacres eager schmucky side which given Damons natural charm is almost endearing at first. The screenwriter Scott Z. Burns trying to shed light on Whitacres inner life creates antic voice-over monologues for him. In the midst of an ordinary task Whitacre will suddenly and without cause take off into bizarrely detailed ruminations--most strangely one about the inappropriateness of Japanese men in suits buying used girls panties on the street. Highly inappropriate he insists. He seems like a moral fellow with vagrant thoughts and judgments--a little crazy perhaps but then who doesnt have intricate flights of fancy or indignation while standing at a checkout line or walking across a parking lot? We get the sense of an indiscriminate intellectual curiosity that cant be contained by the routines of the workday. When Whitacre is revealed as a liar were shocked and Soderbergh moving swiftly and surely through short scenes keeps the style ambiguous--lodged somewhere between thriller and farce. This is a full-scale production with locations all over the globe yet its also an aggressively perverse joke. Soderbergh gets as far away as possible from the earnest anguished tone of Michael Manns ""The Insider"" in which Russell Crowe gave an angry performance as a tobacco executive who having spilled the goods on his company fears for his familys safety. By contrast nothing in ""The Informant"" is quite straight. Many of the actors (including Tom Wilson Joel McHale and Tom Papa) are standup comics and they give their lines slightly ironic inflections--a pause a smile a tic--that knock the scenes off kilter or at least away from melodrama. Lysine and price-fixing are the MacGuffins here; theyre not really what the movie is about. ""The Informant"" turns out to be a comedy devoted to a series of conundrums. Among many other things why in the world does Whitacre get exercised about price-fixing when hes a man of dubious honesty himself? After each of his whoppers is exposed he wins our trust again--we want to believe in him--then promptly loses it once more. By the end Soderberghs movie subverts common belief far more effectively than some of the fantasy movies knocking around this summer. Its a vertiginous experience that grows increasingly hilarious and the joke is on us. In Jane Campions ""Bright Star"" a half-educated but boldly self-possessed and talented beauty named Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) captures first the admiration and then the love of a tubercular young man (Ben Whishaw) who spends his days sitting with a friend in a darkened room in his house in London or wandering Hampstead Heath in a seeming trance. Hes a most unpromising fellow sometimes spirited and funny but often sunk in quiet and apparently unproductive melancholy. It is 1818 and the young man John Keats will die in a few years at the age of twenty-five and soon afterward become known despite much criticism of his work as one of the greatest English poets since Shakespeare and Milton. Campion doesnt play up the irony that few of her characters have any notion of who the young man is. The movie is not the kind of portentous bio-pic in which history like some sort of hooded eagle perches on the shoulders of every scene waiting to soar. Campion who wrote the script as well as directed keeps the action day-by-day small-scale and casually lyrical. The tale of the love affair (chaste in this version) is told from Fannys point of view. At first she hardly understands poetry. An expert dressmaker and a prodigious flirt she tries to fake her way through a kind of exam administered by Charles Brown (Paul Schneider) Keatss protector and amanuensis. Brown is a self-hating buffoon who nevertheless has a perfect ear for Keatss work; he sees Fanny as an ignorant girl who will trap the poet in the soul-destroying vulgarity of sexual pleasure. At the same time Fannys mother regards Keats as charming but remarkably impecunious--an unsuitable match for her daughter. In some ways ""Bright Star"" is a conventional tale of frustrated young love. The stern elders relent and Keats and Fanny spend much time together--kissing and canoodling like any other young pair but also reciting back and forth some of Keatss poetry almost as if it were the stuff of everyday conversation. Fanny becomes both muse and sounding board and Abbie Cornish eyes widening breasts partly bared is a luscious ideal. Many of Whishaw and Cornishs scenes together have a high-spirited delicacy that borders on the precious but then pulls back. For instance Whishaw speaks some of the poems as if he were not quite sure that he had the right to impose them on other peoples attention. In this interpretation Keats is still a brilliant boy his genius constrained by shyness and chagrin. Campion makes only one serious mistake when Whishaw recites the lines ""Pillowed upon my fair loves ripening breast / To feel for ever its soft fall and swell"" he actually rests his head on Cornishs chest. The literalness borders on the laughable and you wonder disconcertingly how these two relieve what look like unbearable states of arousal. In general though Campion handles as well as any director has the impossible task of fitting poetry into everyday life. Keats speaks plainly and vigorously much of the time but he also slips into metaphor and eloquence as easily as the rest of us slip into banality. In ""Bright Star"" he is convincingly a great dying poet. What makes the movie extraordinary however is not so much the portrait of a poet as the accuracy and the detail of the period re-creation. Indoors a whitish light from the windows half-illuminates rooms. Theres a full complement of geese and mud and some women in bonnets but Campion avoids finery and ceremony. She doesnt show off the period; she triumphantly makes it a time in which people live as best they can. A few outdoor scenes are set in dry fields but there are summer moments too of spectacular lavender flowers and innumerable butterflies. I dont think its mere sentiment to demonstrate that the author of the odes and sonnets though miserable obscure and disappointed lived at times in scenes of the most intense beauty.

By David Edelstein Published Sep 13 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Apparition) Jane Campions high-strung romance Bright Star has a rhythm all its ownglancing yet abrasive. Every quick exchange conveys violence not physical but with physical power as if blood could truly be poisoned by lovesickness and a heart could literally break. In pungent strokes the film depicts the agonizingly unconsummated affair of the poet John Keats (Ben Whishaw) and his young Hampstead neighbor the flirtatious fashionable Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish). She begs Keats to tutor her in poetry and longs to become his wife however dire his prospects; he writhes from the sting of poverty and critical disdain. There is a third unruly force Keatss friend Charles Armitage Brown (Paul Schneider) whose antipathy toward Fanny borders on invasive. He mocks and harangues her consciously adopting the manners of the ape she has branded himdetermined to keep his fragile Keats in a pure state primed for the visit of the Muse. Given the stress on the poor Romantic genius its surprising his first consumptive cough takes as long to arrive as it does. Bright Star is the nearest the New Zealandborn auteur Campion has come to what Keats called negative capability which Ill define here as entering fully into an imaginative world and leaving ones arty mannerisms and punishingly masochistic feminist agenda behind. Well there is a modest feminist agenda. Working with poet and Keats biographer Sir Andrew Motion Campion aims to salvage Brawnes good name. In the nineteenth century she gained a reputation as an Alma Mahlerlike slut (only less beautiful and talented) who overtaxed her brilliant lover and had the tastelessness to publish his demonstrative love letters when his star was posthumously ascendant. The movie leaves no doubt that the world is better for those sublime letters and that the bullyboy Brownwho knocks up the Irish maid (Antonia Campbell-Hughes)is male predatory instinct incarnate. What keeps all this from seeming overmelodramatic is Schneiders huge performance which is too hilarious. All costume dramas need actors this rude. Even if you set aside Schneider Bright Star is remarkably evocative. It is our postmodern ironic way to picture Romantic poets as lyrical fops lolling under gray English skies their musings interrupted by bronchial spasms aimed at tastefully blood-spotted handkerchiefs. But Campion brings out the tension between Keatss supple language with its yearning for the eternal (Bright star would I were stedfast as thou art ) and his fevered awareness of his own mortality. One scenein which a miserable Fanny and her little sister Toots (Edie Martin) fill her room with butterflieshas a visionary mixture of beauty and evanescence. Production and costume designer Janet Patterson revels in the eye-popping showiness of 1820s fashionsBrawnes self-sewn flouncy ruffles the elongated top hatswithout tipping into camp. Their movie has too much rough texture for camp. Cornish and Whishaw are wonderfully matched. Shes plusher than in the past and her character struggles for poise in a way thats most unKeira Knightley. Shes a touching mess when she lies on her bed all coquettishness burned away and moans Is this love? Ill never tease about it again. Whishaw gropes his way through verses I know so well as if hes still working on them. There isnt a less-than-perfect performance but in the end my heart belongs to Toots. Young Edie Martin with her chaotic swarm of red ringlets and deadpan dutifulness (she has few lines but theyre goodies) is the movies sign of eternal springthe butterfly atop the just-opened blossom. Two films depict wildly disparate whistle-blowers Steven Soderberghs true-ish comedy The Informant and Judith Ehrlich and Rick Goldsmiths documentary The Most Dangerous Man in America Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers. What a contrast a limp burlesque and a straight-ahead enthralling story of moral courage. The former based on a book by Kurt Eichenwald plays like a pale depopulated Burn After Reading with a fatted Matt Damon doing a Halloween numberdark hair helmet big glasses thick mustache. He plays Mark Whitacre who exposed a price-fixing conspiracy at Archer Daniels Midland but turned out to be a major head case. Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns are utterly uninterested in corporate misbehavior and its ramifications so the agribusiness giant comes off as a rather convivial enterprise. They home in on the freak show presenting Whitacre as the wacked-out soul of corporate Americaa man who sees vacant land and dreams of outlet stores food courts. This is yet another of Soderberghs exercises in style which means he has one big idea and sticks to it. He makes the space shallow and ugly (faces are bathed in orange) and adds groovy sixties titles and Marvin Hamlisch music. The Informant does raise a fascinating question How can humans so compartmentalize their psyches? But Whitacre has no staturehes just a nut. Steven Spielberg explored this dualityand the crazy hope underlying itso much more engagingly in Catch Me If You Can. The Most Dangerous Man in America also centers on an insider who attempted in vain to reconcile his career and his conscience. But this story changed the world. Im ashamed to admit I knew so little about Ellsberg a marine who studied decision-making under duress fought the Cold War fight against Stalinist dictatorships then traveled from Santa Monica California and the Rand Corporation to the Mekong Delta. There he saw firsthand that the Vietnam War was unwinnable made the case to his superiors and watched in shock as they lied their asses off. The more he studied the history of Southeast Asia the more he saw that all the presidents lied Truman Eisenhower Kennedy Johnson and finally Nixon who campaigned on a platform of stopping the war while in private vowing to hammer this shit-ass little country. Narrated by Ellsberg the movie offers one revelatory interview after another mixed with reenactments (animated) that have fun with the caper-movie aspect and build real suspense. So many people risked their livelihoods to put the 7000-page Pentagon Papers out therealthough its most tangible result was the creation of Nixons plumbers unit.

The wacky little brother of ""Erin Brockovich"" ""The Informant"" goofs around lightheartedly while still doing some justice to the true-life story of a zealous but wildly delusional corporate whistle-blower. A larky outing for director Steven Soderbergh after the somber rigors of ""Che"" and ""The Girlfriend Experience"" the pic showcases an excellent performance by a chubbed-out Matt Damon as a Midwestern executive whos so smart hes dumb. Amusingly eccentric rather than outright funny this Warner Bros. release will have to rely mostly on Damon for its B.O. which looks to be modest. Having already done a major film that called out big business with a straight face Soderbergh returns to the same arena with a cocked eyebrow and lots of jokers up his sleeve. The exclamation point on the title and the jaunty old-fashioned score by Marvin Hamlisch serve as immediate tipoffs as to the films hyperreal intentions which will inevitably put some viewers off but for others will provide an amusing original angle on the sort of story thats almost always done with an earnest sense of self-importance. In some ways you could call ""The Informant"" Soderberghs Richard Lester movie in light of his devotion to the Britain-based American director of cutting serious comedies. Packed out with 30 extra pounds a moustache artfully done hairpiece and dorky glasses Damon plays Mark Whitacre a gung-ho VP at a Decatur Ill.-based agribusiness firm Archer Daniels Midland where ""corn goes in one end and profit comes out the other."" A career biochemist entirely behind the promotion of such food additives as lysine Mark unleashes a staggering corporate and legal tsunami when he tells his boss hes detected a mole in the ranks thats allowing a Japanese competitor to mess with their lysine manufacturing. Instead of meeting a 10 million extortion demand ADM calls in the FBI which taps the home phone of the cooperative Mark. At the urging of his wife Ginger (Melanie Lynskey) Mark goes further privately informing agent Brian Shepard (Scott Bakula) of a massive international price-fixing scheme involving lysine. Suddenly excited -- in a boyish secret-agent sort of way -- at the prospect of going undercover Mark agrees to wear a wire at work to provide the evidence the government needs to make its case and he circles the globe trying to get executives to blurt out what is seldom addressed explicitly. The lynchpin and most inspired stroke of the entire movie is the voiceover narration screenwriter Scott Z. Burns (""The Bourne Ultimatum"") has cooked up for Mark. The almost constant flow of Marks interior thoughts crucially signals the mans active fantasy life as well as his intelligence imagination humor and oddness. Sometimes the private commentary relates to onscreen events but more often its borderline stream-of-consciousness a wonderful conceit that still only partially reveals the protagonist but suggests that part of him is out of touch not only with reality but with himself. Labeling himself Agent 0014 ""because Im twice as smart as James Bond"" Mark also is obsessed with Michael Crichton novels particularly ""Rising Sun"" for its prediction of a Japanese takeover of world business. Other casual details also speak volumes such as his huge collection of expensive European sports cars. At a certain point Marks story begins to simultaneously unravel and become more stupendous than ever driving his FBI contacts batty -- well there used to be price-fixing but theres not anymore; there never was a mole in the first place; once the miscreants at ADM are cleared out Mark will be the last man standing and hell run the company. Over the course of 21/2 years Mark and the FBI get plenty of incriminating stuff on tape but thats only half the story as Marks machinations become wildly more grandiose. Soderbergh doesnt play any of this for outright laughs but has cast quite a few comic actors in supporting roles -- even the Smothers Brothers pop up in cameos Tom as the ADMchairman Dick as a judge -- and lets the comedy emerge from the head-spinning swirl of events and mental charades. Filming in actual locations helpfully grounds the flights of the fabulist protag -- even the Whitacre home at the time was used -- and the corporate offices unstylish suits and assorted bland hotels and offices exude total authenticity. Soderberghs lensing alter ego Peter Andrews again gets excellent results with the Red camera. Damon is in very sharp form in his fifth film with Soderbergh. The thesp makes Mark brazen in his conviction that hes always right and unremorseful about his fabrications but never in a superior hubristic manner; as is slowly revealed hes always been able to rationalize any alteration of reality that served his purposes and even when faced with his own deviousness he never doubts that ""Im the good guy in all this."" One weak spot is the portrayal of his marriage. Having known Mark since youth Ginger sticks with him no matter what. But she has to assume a greater complicity than is gleaned from the way Mark brushes aside her inquiries into developments and a keener awareness on her part of what goes on in his strange head would have been welcome.
