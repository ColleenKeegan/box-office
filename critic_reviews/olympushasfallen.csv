Next Out of Africa Millennium Films Facebook Twitter Print Movies Olympus Games Plus a Tina Fey fizzle and the pervy ugly Spring Breakers by Wesley Morris on March 22 2013 Sometimes no matter how many right notes an action movie hits -- no matter how thoroughly say the White House is sacked; how comically the secretary of Defense is dragged down a hall while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance; or how satisfying it is to watch one ex-soldier and former Secret Service agent take down dozens of North Korean lunatics to save the president of the United States -- it can still feel like the filmmakers just tore open a pouch labeled ""blockbuster"" poured its powder into a bowl and opened the microwave. Olympus Has Fallen is made from action-movie mix. Just add sweat. The music (horns strings swiftly beaten drums) is too much like what you hear in video-game home screens and military recruitment ads. The story in which North Korean terrorists hold hostage the president (Aaron Eckhart) and some of his Cabinet is political the way army fatigues on Rihanna are political. And the star (Gerard Butler) feels like the producers third or fourth backup even though one of the producers is the star himself. Despite the professionalism put into downing American helicopters arranging corpses on the White House lawn and making sure every Beltway-disaster-movie cliche is checked off all Olympus Has Fallen has going for it is that generic professionalism. Butler plays Mike a detective who used to guard the First Family until a terrible accident forced his pal the president to demote him. Mike sees his old buddies and gets wistful for his old job. When the North Koreans hatch their absurdly effective hostage plot Mike gets armed to the teeth and prowls through the Oval Office and Lincoln Bedroom with the amusing seriousness of a Mattel toy starring in Platoon. The store-brand quality that courses through this movie also has to do with Butlers being surrounded by Eckhart Melissa Leo Angela Bassett Ashley Judd Radha Mitchell and Morgan Freeman without really ever giving them an occasion to rise to. Well after about 85 minutes of sitting tied up next to Eckhart it is Leo who gets to defiantly recite that Pledge of Allegiance. But its hard to watch anything that so badly misuses its four leading women. Mitchell spends most of her time nursing it up at a nearby hospital in crisis mode. Like First Lady Judd shes here (however expendably) to remind us that when Mike and POTUS lock eyes and eventually arms its just two dudes being in love ... with like um standing up to terrorism and saving America. But we also need the movie to throw us better more original curveballs than casting a hot guy (Rick Yune) as the terrorist mastermind or finding new ways to cross off Beltway-disaster-movie cliche no. 1 making Freeman commander-in-chief. Yes because Eckhart and the vice-president are holed up Speaker of the House Freeman takes over and reminds you that as ferocious and intense an actor as Eckhart is nothing about him says ""presidential."" Antoine Fuqua ( Training Day Shooter) directs with the dutiful anonymity of whoever made Iron Eagle II or Delta Force 3. Without the showmans insanity of a Michael Bay the flagrance of a Jerry Bruckheimer the boundless cash of a Joel Silver or the hawkish ideology of a Tom Clancy adaptation youre left with an accidental parody of what happens when crazies attack. You want gusto. You want evil. You want charisma. You get a lot of cardboard heroism and self-defensive machismo. Butler is more than serviceable even though his American accent is like water in a dirty glass. (All you can taste is the residue of whatever was in it before.) In one flavorless film after the next he has always seemed like a cut-rate Russell Crowe or discount Mel Gibson -- the fire in him is Duraflame. But this movie is a shrewd choice. I could hear the audience falling in love with him the night I saw it. With the old icons virtually obsolete we might be ready for a newer loosely younger indestructible paragon of pseudo-military awesomeness. This is why were coming back around to Dwayne Johnson whos more convincing at this kind of bravado. But in a pinch Butlers forced charisma will do. Tina Feys starred in only four movies in the past 10 years -- Mean Girls Baby Mama and Date Night were the first; the fourth an aggravating romantic comedy called Admission opens this weekend. And in each you leave convinced that theres a more damaged side of herself than even what shes shown as Liz Lemon. On television the emotional complexity you suspect her of having was insulated by farce. At the movies there are too many opportunities for the camera and editing to catch her surprised by her vulnerability. When Alec Baldwin put her down on 30 Rock Fey was able to bob on the currents of his loving bile. In the rare moments when Admission is at its best the bile leaves a burn. She plays Portia Nathan a drably scrupulous Princeton admissions officer who gets a call to visit an experimental school in New Hampshire run by an old Dartmouth classmate of hers named John (Paul Rudd). When the kids give her grief about the oppressive corporate bogusness of the Ivy League system she snaps back at them. But when her uptight long-term condescending British professor boyfriend (Michael Sheen) leaves her for an undermining colleague she slumps. The movie isnt about the breakup. And even though I actually dont know what Admission is about theres ache enough in Fey to wish shed find material that allows her to explore it. Karen Croner adapted the film from a 2009 novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz. You can feel the script and director Paul Weitz trying to smooth a lot of activity into a single movie. But larded with a lot of physical comedy (cue Portia delivering a baby calf) it never ever coheres. At work Portia is vying to become the new dean of admission. She winds up in and out of the home of her estranged mom (Lily Tomlin) an ice queen earth mother and best-selling emasculator. John keeps pushing one of his students on her an oddball and screwup named Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) and after the first time its uncomfortable. Meanwhile the movie keeps pushing her in front of John. Each of these developments proceeds in a tone that has nothing to do with the other. Very few of the actors bring anything out of anyone else. And sexually Fey and Rudd have nothing to offer. When their bodies touch it feels scholarly like watching a pencil trying to kiss a pen. At the heart of the problem with this movie are matters of logic and cogency. As Jeremiah becomes a Princeton applicant John tells Portia that the kid whos been adopted by a couple is the son she gave up years ago at Dartmouth. How a woman as procedure-oriented as Portia would allow herself to get mixed up in a potential scandal doesnt wash. Neither does the ""you didnt love me enough"" melodrama with her mother. The character shuttlecocks from one implausible scenario to the next. In order for her sense of maternity to resonantly corrupt her professional integrity we have to believe in the kid and as delightfully unusual as Wolff is as a screen presence we dont see enough of Jeremiah to care when she sticks her neck out for him. But Fey makes a case that the real romance here is entirely parental. If were aligned with Portia at all its because the woman playing her is too. In movies Fey hasnt come close to reaching her flashpoint. The pratfalls and humiliations are getting in the way of what she could do with the maternal angst that she clearly drawn to. Between her old TV show and her movies I think shes been playing that mommy angst so long that its no longer funny to her. Its real. Right now her comedy blunts the sharpness of whatevers fostering that angst. If she dared to let the anesthesia wear off what she might do with the pain could be seismic. Its always fair to hope that Harmony Korines movies -- Gummo Julien Donkey-Boy Mister Lonely Trash Humpers the new Spring Breakers which is spreading around the country like an STD -- are on to something. You want to believe that theres some perception behind his grimy druggy vision for the movies that his carnivalesque attraction to freaks and creeps and the shocking stuff he has them do makes him a kind of Diane Arbus that he can sense truth in ugliness. Korine seems to be absorbing the same culture as the rest of us -- watching the same television listening to the same music getting the same greasy fingers we all do from gossip glossies. But Korines movies are like a toxic reaction to it all like he keeps missing the warning that says ""Packed in a facility that also handles nuts."" With his celebrity-impersonator romance Mister Lonely the toxicity achieved sweetness. The low-definition pranksterism of Trash Humpers was like watching homemade horror. For about a 20-minute stretch the definition in Spring Breakers is exhilaratingly high. Korine has swapped out the fuzz and grain and blur of his other movies for lasered digital crispness and microsecond montages. These are the minutes after which three college girls (Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson and Korines wife Rachel) have held up a diner to realize the spring break dreams of another friend -- a dull Christian played by Selena Gomez. They arrive in St. Petersburg Florida fully bikinied hungry for fun and open to exploitation. But theyre not what brings Korine to the beaches and cheap motels. Its the opportunity to marry jiggling flesh and hypnotically fruity color to the squealing bleating pump of the music of Skrillex. What Korine does with the beer-soaked skin face-devouring makeouts and piles and piles of barely dressed people is intensify the college-party atmosphere in a way that feels simultaneously orgasmic and repulsive. The moral squalor is so thick you can practically smell the police investigation. But in going for stylized personification Korine loses the social principle. Diane Arbus warps into Nan Goldin. The degradation the girls face at the hands of horny young men is supposed to be tolerable because a couple of the girls seem to invite and instigate it (and perhaps because one of the girls is married to the director). You dont sense that Korine has gone into any scene with an agenda for what he hopes to achieve a scene later. When the college foursome winds up in the care and the bed of a rapping drug-dealing cornrowed sleaze played by James Franco the movie seems to flee from what ideas it has in a hurry like a plastic bottle speeding down a river. Everything Franco does here calls attention to itself if for no other reason than hes the only person in front of the camera with any discernible skill. Hudgens and Gomez appear to be here for the credibility-boosting stunt work. But Gomez seems afraid for her life and Hudgens whos really going for it cant yet act to save hers. As a team the quartet weaves into and out of embarrassment. When the girls gang up on Franco and force him to give head to a gun Spring Breakers scrambles the obviousness of the metaphor and turns strangely erotic. Still as committed as Franco is to doing everything Korine asks of him he instantly removes all the danger menace and atmosphere from the movie. His fame purifies the air. The risk is all on the women and Korine appears to have no capacity to redeem them. All the better to shock you I guess. But the movie is too calculated to shock. Korine just wants to be the danger hes warning us about.

In September Channing Tatum will hold the fort against an invasion in Roland Emmerichs White House Down. However if you cant wait for two hours of American national monuments going up in flames Antoine Fuquas seemingly identical Olympus Has Fallen (the title is military code for well White House Down) delivers unrelenting action with lunkheaded glee. The film nods to Independence Day - the standard by which all such films must be measured - by taking place on July 5 but the chief model is Die Hard. With Washington under siege and hunky president Aaron Eckhart taken hostage its left to disgraced aide Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) to enter the White House and see off the invaders with bullets torture and one-liners. Lets play a game of ""fuck off"" he snarls at chief villain Rick Yune. You go first. Occasional segues to the hostage chamber (where Eckhart and feisty Defence Secretary Melissa Leo are kicked around with gay abandon) and the negotiation room (where Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett furrow their brows and wait for their cheques to clear) are seemingly designed to allow Butler a fag break between bouts of badassery. The thrills and the effects are cheap but this is in hard-driving good-humoured command of its own silliness. White House up at least until September.

By David Denby Ryan Gosling plays a stunt biker in a movie directed by Derek Cianfrance.   Credit Illustration by David Palumbo Derek Cianfrances earnest broodingly ambitious movie ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" begins with a close-up of Ryan Goslings tattooed torso which as Emma Stone noted in ""Crazy Stupid Love"" looks Photoshopped for perfection. The shot continues without a cut as Gosling--a stunt biker named Luke--walks into a carnival tent climbs onto a motorcycle rides into a steel globe (""the Cage of Death"") and zips around the interior of the structure like a fly in a jar. Its existentialism in a nutshell life and possibly death on a journey going nowhere. Cianfrance (""Blue Valentine"") and his cinematographer Sean Bobbitt stay close to the restless Luke as he tears down the streets and through the surrounding woods of Schenectady New York where the travelling carnival is playing. Luke encounters a woman he had a fling with last time he was in town Romina (Eva Mendes) who now has a baby boy--his son it turns out. He wants Romina back but he has no money so he becomes a bank robber to support her and the child. Now there may be an interesting movie in the story of a man whos split between the stability of family life and the anarchy of outlawry but Cianfrance devoted to Goslings macho mystique hasnt made it. Cool violent a cigarette dangling from his mouth Gosling reprises his inexorable-loner routine from ""Drive."" Cianfrance and the screenwriters Ben Coccio and Darius Marder wrote thirty-seven drafts of the script but gave him almost nothing to say. He rides he smokes he knocks over banks he loves his baby and thats it. Perhaps Cianfrance didnt want to waste words on Gosling because in a shocking move he disposes of him early in deliberate imitation of the way Hitchcock disposed of Janet Leigh in ""Psycho."" Gosling doesnt go near a shower but he gets plugged by a character weve never seen before Avery (Bradley Cooper) a lawyer who decided to become a cop to do the peoples work on the street. Avery is the new protagonist and Cooper gives a quiet serious performance as a straight arrow. The second part of ""Pines"" is all about Averys fight against police corruption. Its the kind of story thats been done in the movies many times in urban settings that are--how shall I put it?--more richly colorful than Schenectady. The policemans crusade initially seems disconnected from the first part of the movie but it turns out that Avery after shooting Luke and leaving his little boy fatherless feels so guilty that he has trouble looking at his own baby son. Does this make any sense psychologically? Im not sure but again the idea might have worked if Cianfrance had dramatized it. Instead he produces the admission of remorse from Avery in a long scene with a psychiatrist. We never see Avery and his son together until the films third act when the boy is seventeen. After a while we realize that ""Pines"" is supposed to be about turbulent male relationships through the generations--what fathers and sons give to one another and withhold from one another. Im all in favor of experimental narrative forms and deep thematic undercurrents but this movie feels patchy and underdone. Cianfrance does however have a commanding way with actors and he pushes them to the edge. In the third section Lukes and Averys sons who dont know each other--or their fathers history--get thrown together in high school and start a friendship that falls into an uneasy combative rivalry. Cianfrance has cast two intense young actors Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen as the boys who are both into Ecstasy and Oxycontin and he sustains a nasty friction between them sandpaper rubbing sandpaper. Eva Mendes as Lukes lover a proud woman in love with a dangerous man puts every bit of anguished longing and overstrained faith that she can into her few scenes; she surges toward Gosling but the movie tosses her aside. ""Pines"" centered on the male line also slights Averys wife played by the elegant Rose Byrne. When Emory Cohen cast as her and Averys son shows up hes a loutish kid with a Long Island street accent. Even as a rebel and a screwup who never had his fathers love he isnt believable as the child of either parent. Cianfrance keeps his eye on the long lines of the film but a lot of the character details are fuzzy or approximate or just missing and the movie which holds your attention from moment to moment by the end leaves you grasping for the experience you havent had. It may be one of the casualties of the auteur theory and the general solemnization of directors that some of the most talented people now just start shooting a script as if big ideas and directorial vision were enough to hold a movie together. Sometimes a little hard common sense helps too. The American flag waving in freedom-loving air above the White House is shot full of holes and rudely tossed onto the lawn in ""Olympus Has Fallen"" a bullet-ridden hunk of paranoia that should stir up anyone not sufficiently attuned to the threat posed to the United States by North Korea. The Koreans it seems are coming. An elite commando squad of forty led by a thick-shouldered terrorist named Kang (Rick Yune) fight their way into the building take the President (Aaron Eckhart) hostage execute the Vice-President on television kick the Secretary of State (Melissa Leo) in the stomach and in general soil the linens of Americas citadel. The thugs threaten to kill the President too. Their demands are the withdrawal of American forces from South Korea and of the Seventh Fleet from waters near the Korean peninsula; they want to ""unify"" the Korean people. They are also trying to get the secret codes that will allow them to blow up American I.C.B.M.s in their silos thus leaving the country a wasteland. The Speaker of the House (Morgan Freeman) takes command but the only one who can save the President--not to mention the world--is a disgraced former Secret Service agent Mike Banning. Hes played by Gerard Butler a second-tier star from Scotland whose lack of humor may remind you why Bruce Willis has lasted so long as an action hero. Banning runs into the building and proceeds to eliminate one terrorist after another bashing one guy over the head with a bust of Lincoln. The movie is ""Die Hard"" in the White House a combination of the violent and the cheesy which may nevertheless push a few buttons. The box-office gods seem to have smiled on this project; just before ""Olympus"" opened the North Koreans conducted an underground nuclear test and then threatened to ""target"" America with their high-level missile technology. In principle Im willing to be concerned about North Korea. Im even willing to be entertained by an action movie about Korean terrorists. But ""Olympus"" is an entirely conventional film and one cant help feeling that the director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") and the first-time screenwriters Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt were looking around for a new enemy and just settled on the North Koreans. Beneath the alarm bell summoning the nation to a new danger most moviegoers will detect the familiar tones of big-budget exploitation. I liked Fuquas volatile work in ""Training Day"" (2001) and this movie starts well. In a kind of prologue set eighteen months earlier the Presidents car spins out of control on a bridge during a furious snowstorm. Banning saves his boss but allows the First Lady (Ashley Judd) to fall to her death. (Like Clint Eastwoods Secret Service agent in ""In the Line of Fire"" hes haunted by his failure and needs to prove himself again.) This nighttime sequence is eerily beautiful and frightening. The assault on the White House is unconvincing but it has our curiosity going for it how do you storm the best-defended building in the world? Apparently you begin by getting a slow-moving military plane to shoot up Washington which creates something of a distraction. Then innocent-looking Korean tourists outside the White House suddenly pull machine guns and explosives out of their backpacks blast through the fence and fight their way in. But once Fuqua moves inside he loses our attention because weve watched what follows dozens of times before. There are endless scenes of Banning moving down darkened corridors and engaging in firefights and hand-to-hand combat shot in the usual fragmented way which makes it impossible to see most of what is happening. And Fuqua doesnt deliver on what he has set up. Early in the film he makes much of the Presidents young son who knows the inner corridors and tunnels of the White House but once the assault begins the kid hides; he never gets to use much of his knowledge. The President is supposed to be a tough guy but hes tied up in an underground bunker most of the time getting slapped around; he never really gets into the movie either. ""Olympus"" ends with a burst of patriotic fervor and the words ""They came to desecrate a way of life. But they gave us a gift a chance for rebirth."" The movie isnt a desecration but its action filmmaking not America that needs to be reborn.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Theres a template here a recurrent theme that hinges on two things violation and retaliation. The roots go deep in American popular culture -- and in film back to D.W. Griffiths Birth of a Nation (1915) the first blockbuster vigilante picture. Its all there a government thats powerless or corrupt women who are under attack by alien others and enlightened individuals (here the Klan) who are forced to take justice into their own hands to reclaim their rightful-righteous supremacy. Skipping ahead we come to Death Wish (1974) starring Charles Bronson as a New Yorker whose wife and daughter are raped (his wife dies; his daughter goes mad) and who becomes a vigilante the lone hunter in an urban jungle where the animals rule. Fast-forward to 1988 and a new but related template in Die Hard. After an attack by foreigners on American soil an emasculated New York cop -- out of his jurisdiction (in La-La Land) with no gun (or shoes) and a wife who has reverted to her maiden name -- scuttles around behind the scenes killing terrorists in defiance of arrogant bureaucrats in the police department and FBI. He wins of course Hes all American and all man. And so is Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) the Secret Service hero of the incredibly brutal Olympus Has Fallen. The movie is Die Hard squared -- far more Die Hard-ish than any of the low-impact Die Hard sequels. Banning has been banished from the White House after a split-second decision to save the life of the president (Aaron Eckhart) at the expense of the First Lady (Ashley Judd). It was the right call -- his superior (Angela Bassett) knows it -- but not protecting ones women is a big stigma in this kind of movie. This formerly treasured agent moves across town so as not to remind the POTUS and his son Connor (Finley Jacobson) of that tragic night. But then comes the supreme violation and the chance to restore his honor. The North Korean supervillain even points that out in the course of taunting Banning about his past failures. Images of Lincoln and Kennedy abound to remind us of what the ultimate failure would be. The plot During a presidential meeting with South Korean diplomats some kind of souped-up cargo plane invades D.C. air space riddling people (Secret Service and bystanders alike) with bullets and firing into the White House. Half the Washington Monument crumbles -- symbolic on a couple of levels. Olympus -- the code name for the White House -- falls. Terrorists shoot almost everyone inside and take the president the vice-president and the secretary of State (Melissa Leo) hostage in an underground vault. But one man drives like mad to the scene dodges bullets and explosions as agents drop around him and gets inside alone but on his game. The North Korean psycho mouths leftist-sounding slogans (globalization Wall Street perfidy) and surrounds himself with an assemblage of Asians Middle Easterners and people of darker hues plus a turncoat agent. A TV newscaster reports the Middle East response to the White House attack is ""jubilant."" Yes some on the ""Arab street"" rejoiced after 9/11 but the reminder here is gratuitous. What we Americans -- personified by Banning -- can do is defend ourselves. In one scene he uses a bust of Lincoln to bust the head of a foreign terrorist. See how we turn our icons into weapons of destruction. Olympus Has Fallen is a disgusting piece of work but it certainly hits its marks -- it makes you sick with suspense. The director Antoine Fuqua gave us Training Day and other movies that made a pretense of using violence as more than a means of getting us off. But this is straight-ahead red-meat right-wing xenophobic exploitation. The carnage is cruel and crude. Waves of people go down in showers of gore. The Stars and Stripes is shot full of holes and ripped down -- it drifts to the ground in slow motion. Waiting for word in the situation room is whats left of the government -- including Bassetts Secret Service director and Morgan Freeman as the speaker of the House turned acting president a role for which hes well prepared having shepherded us through a comet strike in the late-nineties. When Banning phones in from the Oval Office some of the bureaucrats are dubious They remember the First Ladys death. And Robert Forsters general scowls under his hair plugs and ignores Bannings advice not to send in the SEALs or theyll be slaughtered. Guess what he does and guess what happens. Butler doesnt evince much personality but hes solid -- by which I mean he moves well and hes all muscle. Of Banning Bassetts director tells Freemans president ""He will move mountains or die trying."" Banning doesnt move mountains but he shoots stabs and strangles a lot of bad guys. The preview audience loved it when he tortured a couple. When he plunged a knife in the throat of one to get the other to talk they nearly died laughing. They also loved it when Melissa Leo -- having been pounded to a pulp -- spit through a mouthful of blood ""Fuck you."" She takes the punishment well manfully. Retaliation when it comes must hurt. We need to see in the violators eyes an acknowledgment of his -- and by extension our -- superiority. Here I must admit that a lot of not-twisted people enjoy violent junk like Olympus Has Fallen including on occasion moi. But Im disturbed by the way in which these tropes hold sway over large segments of the populace. Obviously we face real threats as individuals and a country. But to walk around waiting -- and dreaming -- of the assault (on our women our homes our flag) that will allow us to pull out our weapons and start blasting seems ... maladaptive. The disproportionate number of violation and retaliation scenarios suggests an outright addiction. I dont know what it means but I know that these films dont help us to understand and master our fears -- they perpetuate those fears and then deliver surges of relief. Theyve helped create a class of men who wander around looking for a bloody fix.

"Review Olympus Has Fallen a remix of standard action fare - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Olympus Has Fallen a remix of standard action fareAntoine Fuquas White House-under-siege thriller doesnt add anything new to the genre and neither does swaggering hero-star Gerard Butler.March 21 2013|By Robert Abele A tale neither of ancient Greece nor of a camera companys market share ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is instead a typical slab of Hollywood action in which the White House crumbles under attack the American flag is tattered and tossed aside by baddies and clichA(c)s rise like gods.Gerard Butler swagger-stars as ex-Secret Service tough guy Mike Banning who leaps into action from his desk job at Treasury when terrorists initiate a bloody expertly timed home invasion on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Once inside he becomes the only man a or as he modestly puts it at one point ""the best hope youve got"" a to save the president (Aaron Eckhart) before he gives away nuclear codes to a sadistic megalomaniac (Rick Yune).The commander in chiefs young son is missing as well and could become a pawn for the terrorists if hes not found. Theres a redemption angle too of course 18 months before Banning couldnt save the presidents wife (Ashley Judd) in a car accident. But really if youre Special Forces-trained and have extensive knowledge of the White House interior do you need any motivation besides saving the free world?PHOTOS Scenes from Olympus Has FallenAnother screenplay question Does everything in this movie credited to writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt have to be ripped from ""Die Hard""? The inside man is one thing but the idiots in authority the rooftop adventure gone bad the hero mistaking a bad guy for a good guya| its a hostage movie all right of that 1988 suspense classic. (Bond movies too and ""In the Line of Fire"" for good measure.)Antoine Fuqua is at the reins and while he isnt a terrible action director a ""Shooter"" and ""Training Day"" easily entertain a he gives in to terrible instincts here flirting with overwrought patriotism one too many laugh lines amid numerous characters being shot in the head and a general chaos-inspired editing technique all too rampant in todays action cinema.The siege itself is the movies jittery high point a multi-pronged onslaught involving aerial attack diplomatic subterfuge suicide bombs and fusillades of bullets a as a what-if set piece it knocks you back. Too bad the rest of the movie basically toggles between Butler in unlighted rooms ambushing the enemy as presidential portraits look on Morgan Freemans speaker of the House a stationed at a command post a wearily making Important Decisions and Eckhart furiously grimacing at his captor while an Academy Award winner (Melissa Leo) is kicked repeatedly.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 22 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 22 2013 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Antoine Fuqua Written by Creighton Rothenberger Katrin Benedikt Starring Gerard Butler Aaron Eckhart Rick Yune Morgan Freeman Classification 14A Genre thriller Year 2013 Country USA Language English If youve ever wondered if theyll make another Die Hard or Lethal Weapon movie like they did in the eighties you should definitely check out Olympus Has Fallen an entertaining retro-thriller about well you know A blue-collar law-enforcement guy who gets overmatched by a condescending foreign evil genius and emerges bloodied but smirking. Multimedia Olympus Has Fallen The official trailer Gerard Butler (also a producer here) takes a welcome break from his increasingly painful romantic-comedy roles to play the terse presidential body guard Mike Banning. A 10-minute opening prologue establishes him as trusted pal and sparring partner of the U.S. President (Aaron Eckhart) studly protector of the first lady (Ashley Judd) and idol of their son Connor (Finley Jacobsen). All that falls apart when a freak accident leads to tragedy and turns Mike into a pariah working a desk job in the Treasury Department.Then one day he looks out his window to see something unusual going down on the White House lawn. A low-flying cargo plane comes winging in over Virginia knocking out a couple of Air Force fighter jets strafing civilians and monuments alike as it heads toward the White House. At the same time a busload of tourists is revealed to actually be a busload of terrorists who begin a ground assault on the Presidents home.The President along with the visiting South Korean leader and other officials race to an elevator taking them to a bunker deep beneath the White House. Their retreat conforms to the terrorists plans (fans of the TV series Homeland may find this scenario familiar) because the bad guys have a couple of moles on the inside.Not only is it a national calamity but a chance for Mikes redemption. Mike who knows the White House intimately sneaks into the building and sets up radio contact first with the officials on the outside and later with the bad guys. His first job is to locate and rescue the Presidents son (left behind in the elevator ride to the presidential panic room). Then he begins picking off the members of roaming squads of commandos while formulating a plan to stymie the ringleader Kang (Rick Yune) the North Korean rogue terrorist who has masterminded the attack.Most of what follows is a cat-and-mouse game around the dark hallways ducts and walls of the White House and given the premises essential absurdity its almost embarrassingly entertaining. Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) has an infectious enthusiasm for the genres guilty pleasures the reductive absurdities the salty dialogue and the patriotic bushwa. But mostly hes good at the logistics of working out how one swaggering underestimated American can flip the bird to his bureaucratic superiors and defeat an army of foreign fanatics without seeming too cartoonish.Korean-American actor and former model Yune (who played a similar role in Die Another Day the last Pierce Brosnan James Bond film) makes a colourful villain - handsome and insufferably assured and also an unchivalrous sadist who kicks around the Secretary of Defense (Melissa Leo in a pageboy wig) as though shes a hacky sack. Kang lays out demands that begin with the removal of U.S. troops from the Korean demilitarized zone and appear to be pointed toward American Armageddon.Watching all this on a video feed is a circle of overqualified actors playing helpless government officials with Morgan Freeman as Turnbull Speaker of the House and now acting president Angela Bassett as the Secret Service director and Robert Forster as the pit-bull general in charge of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mostly theyre required to stare in horror at monitors and yell variations of the f-word at each other but despite the familiar Austin Powers setup they provide a welcome shot of gusto to the generic proceedings.Occasionally comic Olympus Has Fallen is not entirely guilt-free. The action is brutal - the corridors of power pile up with corpses - and its use of CGI images that echo 9/11 carnage borders on exploitation. Yet the paranoia is also timely. The movie is released the same week that a new North Korean propaganda video shows an imaginary missile attack on Washington (ripped off from an American video game) including the destruction of the White House. Another movie with the same plot White House Down starring Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum and directed by Roland (Independence Day) Emmerich arrives in theatres in June.After the brief self-imposed Hollywood-studio moratorium on disaster movies post-9/11 and then a spate of ""responsible"" disaster films such as World Trade Center United 93 and War of the Worlds the wheel seems to have finally turned; transforming catastrophes into snappy wish-fulfillment fantasies is okay again. Too soon? On the contrary Olympia Has Fallen seems to have arrived right on time.

In ""Olympus Has Fallen"" 40 North Korean commandos using ordinary weapons capture the White House and take the president hostage all in 13 minutes. I guess those sequester budget cuts are really starting to hurt. The film is a second-rate ""Air Force One"" mashed up with a third-rate ""Die Hard"" with Gerard Butler striving mightily to be charismatic as the One Man Who Can Save the Day. But this unapologetic B-movie at least keeps the action rolling and the time goes by quickly. To put it another way Id rather see Gerard Butler stab a terrorist in the neck than flirt with Katherine Heigl. Those loco NoKos tear up 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and hold the president (Aaron Eckhart) his veep and top staffers in a bunker 120 feet below ground. Meanwhile the Speaker of the House (Morgan Freeman) becomes acting president and leads a half-hearted pushback from the Pentagon with the chief of the Secret Service (Angela Bassett) and a top general (Robert Forster). Mike (Butler) has been demoted from the presidents body team after failing to save a political figures life. Disillusioned either by his past or by his similarity to the Clint Eastwood character from ""In the Line of Fire"" he is outside the building when the NoKos roll in. They blast away at the Mall in a stolen Air Force fighter jet (dont we keep those things locked up? Somebody check on this) and blow the top off the Washington Monument before sneak-attacking the presidents home. Somberly we learn from newscasts that this is the first time the White House has been seized since the War of 1812. Fact check I think they forgot General Zod pulled it off in 1981. The special effects in keeping with the general aura of something you once watched on VHS while drinking a Bartles amp; Jaymes are of 1980s quality although the White House invasion scene is carried off with gusto by director Antoine Fuqua (a B-movie maestro who accidentally once made an A-movie ""Training Day""). Fuquas ability to keep things gung-ho at all times makes this one far better than the recent ""Red Dawn"" remake or the fifth ""Die Hard."" The script (like that of ""Air Force One"") has a lot of fun imagining all the secret emergency stuff that might be available to a president. Mike avails himself to all of it sneaking up to weapons caches and hidden passages. Every so often he calls in to banter with the head terrorist who is played by a dull journeyman Rick Yune. Guys Alan Rickman is still around. Why let him go to waste? Hes not Asian but neither are all the bad guys in this movie. The screenwriters try repeatedly to give Butler a YKY (Yippee-Ki-Yay) line but the best they can do is odd remarks like ""Why dont you and I play a game of f - - k off? You go first."" Was that translated from the Korean? Meanwhile Fuqua bungles one of their best ideas a scene in which Mike runs into a colleague he doesnt know has become a turncoat. Instead of letting the tension come to a slow boil Fuqua gives it about 30 seconds and has them duke it out. Then again Fuqua is so sloppy that he has a newscast identify North Korea as being in ""Southeast Asia."" Still the director is better at his job than Butler is at his The actor is as all-American as haggis. Not only would 1980s Bruce Willis have done a better job even Sylvester Stallone would have been superior. How hard can it be to find a tough guy who can lay down a smirk and some automatic-weapons fire with equal aplomb?

Starring Gerard Butler Morgan Freeman Dylan McDermott Aaron Eckhart Ashley Judd Melissa Leo Radha Mitchell Rick Yune Cole Hauser Angela Bassett Director Antoine Fuqua Running time 158 Release Opened Mar 22 2013  Editorial Review Derivative but it does the jobBy Ann HornadayFriday March 22 2013Chalk it up to prescience or just dumb luck that the writers of ""Olympus Has Fallen"" an efficient if unimaginative version of ""Die Hard"" in the White House chose to make their movies villain a terrorist mastermind from the Korean peninsula. At a time when North Korea abrogated its 50-year armistice with South Korea just days before launching a possible cyberattack on its democratic neighbor ""Olympus Has Fallen"" at least possesses the frisson of timeliness amid otherwise hoary action-movie cliches. Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning a Secret Service agent whose close relationship with President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) and his son Connor (Finley Jacobsen) is destroyed after a rescue mission goes awry. After that harrowing prologue the film catches up with Banning as he miserably toils at a desk job in the Treasury Department looking longingly out the window to the White House he once navigated with granular architectural knowledge and macho assurance. Those qualities will come in handy when a visit from the South Korean prime minister ends with Asher the vice president and the secretary of defense (played in hysterical pitch and horrible wig by Melissa Leo) being abducted and held hostage in the White House bunker. Director Antoine Fuqua working from a script by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt stages the takeover of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and its environs with unsettling visceral mayhem as hundreds of civilians are strafed bombed and shot; nearby the Washington Monument crumbles in a distasteful reenactment of the destruction of Sept. 11 2001. Perhaps we can now stipulate that 9/11 has earned permanent ""too soon"" status when it comes to exploiting potent visual iconography in the name of pop entertainment. After 20 minutes of unmitigated carnage its Banning whos left standing. Played with bland humorlessness by Butler he dispassionately dodges every bullet and booby trap to gain access to the White House where his experience with the buildings secret doorways and hidden ductwork stands him in good stead as he engages in a bloody cat-and-mouse game with a mysterious villain named Kang (Rick Yune) and his seemingly endless supply of vicious black-clad commandos. All the while he keeps up a deadpan sat-phone patter with his bosses at the Pentagon -- House speaker and acting president Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) the director of the Secret Service (Angela Bassett) and the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Robert Forster). While the devastating events outside are captured with cheesy-looking special effects and graphic brutality once ""Olympus Has Fallen"" gets to the Oval Office the Lincoln Bedroom and the White Houses lesser-known corridors most of the action consists of subtle neck snaps knifings and kill shots that Banning executes in a series of quick lethal encounters. (Its one of the films good guys who comes in for the most sadistic treatment in a pulverizing beat-down that could easily have been avoided with a few well-timed words from the boss. Feel free to speak up anytime Mr. President) Just a few months ago we were given a worshipful portrait of the White House and its most popular occupant in Steven Spielbergs handsome historical drama ""Lincoln."" In ""Olympus Has Fallen"" the 16th president isnt a fascinatingly complex figure but -- literally -- a blunt instrument used to dispatch a wily foreign opponent. Rather than the locus of messy democracy and murky political choices the White House has reverted to a once-and-future citadel of American triumphalism justified by unimpeachable moral outrage. Fuqua puts us right where we want to be when it comes to patriotic spectacle on top and aggrieved. Spring is barely here and America already has its first summer blockbuster.Contains strong violence and profanity. Will thisBy Stephanie MerrySunday March 17 2013Washingtons worst-case scenario becomes a big-screen reality with ""Olympus Has Fallen"" arriving in theaters. D.C. residents might recognize the story from a nightmare Terrorists launch an impeccably coordinated attack on the city which includes opening fire on tourists and suit-clad lobbyists alike; the White House (code name Olympus) takes a beating leaving the stately mansion a charred bullet-riddled ruin; and the president is taken hostage after the enemy infiltrates his secret bunker. As an added punch to the gut the Washington Monument collapses like the spectacular finale of a game of Jenga. If it hits a little close to home thats the point. Director Antoine Fuqua and actor-producer Gerard Butler wanted the events to seem plausible. ""I try to find a way to ground the movie in some reality in something thats happening in the world in something that we can all connect to"" Fuqua said on a recent visit to Washington. Riveting action rooted in real-world drama is the norm in Fuquas films which also include ""Training Day"" (2001) and ""Tears of the Sun"" (2003). Another common thread is the heros journey. In this case Secret Service agent Mike Banning -- played by Butler -- is tasked with saving the day. Once the favorite handler of President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) Banning is relegated to desk duty after a tragedy involving the first family. But when North Korean terrorists storm the White House Banning finds himself hiding under the crumbling roof of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Inside the bunker a terrorist who goes by Kang begins negotiating with the Pentagon. In return for meeting outrageous demands Kang promises to free the president. This is Bannings opportunity to right his reputation. All he has to do is kill the countless terrorists roaming the White House corridors and then find a way into the impenetrable bunker to save the president and various Cabinet members. ""Thats the Rocky moment. He doesnt think hes going to win"" Butler said. ""When he fights even though he thinks hes going to lose you see his moments of doubt and vulnerability. Thats what I want to work with."" But Butler didnt want to confuse unlikely success with impossibility. Banning may be succeeding against all odds but that does not mean other events should be preposterously far-fetched. Butler saw something special in the original script but when he approached Fuqua to direct he admitted that certain passages were going to need an overhaul. That original version featured civilians being blinded by high-tech gizmos that emit invisible electronic waves and it culminated in a train busting through a wall and into the Potomac River -- ""Definitely out of an 80s action movie"" Butler said. So the actor and director opted to cut down on the frills. The enemies arrive in old trucks and planes. ""Theres a simplicity to it the way theres a simplicity to what happened before where essentially box cutters changed the future of the world"" Butler said. ""Here its a C-130 cargo plane its tourists its trash trucks all of these things that are so normal and yet are so dangerous."" Underneath the special effects chaos of the first script Butler connected with a kind of patriotism-rousing emotion when imagining a White House attack. Even the Scotland native could feel the impact of such an event. ""It is the most powerful building in the world and its the symbol and beacon of freedom"" he said. ""The White House and those institutions are Americas treasures but theyre kind of the worlds treasures as well."" But before the filmmakers could obliterate the presidents home they had to build it. Green screen wasnt an option Fuqua said because characters had to run up stairs and fly through doors walls needed to explode and hundreds of extras and stuntmen needed to swarm the building. The attack on the White House -- which lasts about 20 spellbinding minutes -- was the most complex scene for Fuqua to shoot and Butlers favorite for audiences to see. One of the difficulties was finding the space to build such a massive structure plus an empty freeway to re-create a couple blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue. ""Its hard to find places that just say Yeah okay sure come take over the whole block and blow up some cars and you know theres a C-130 flying overhead "" Fuqua said. Salvation came in the form of Shreveport La. which was ""about 115 degrees"" during filming. The sweat moviegoers see is real. For accuracy in the buildings details Fuqua turned to production designer Derek Hill who had already done extensive research on the White House when working on Oliver Stones ""W."" As for the veracity of the scenes in the presidents secret bunker Fuqua remains cagey about his intel except to say that he has never been inside. ""From what I understand I didnt do too bad"" he said with a wink. For Butlers part he was trained by former Secret Service agents and watched documentaries about the agency. That taught him not only how to move -- ""literally how they turn a corner"" -- but also what the protocol would be if an operative found himself in a similar scenario. That includes everything from finding ammunition to waging psychological warfare on the enemy. The on-set consultants even pushed Butler to include more verbal sparring which sounds a lot like trash-talk during sports games but the actor often opted to speak with actions. While doing research for the film Fuqua encountered a few surprises including one that should reassure Washingtonians. The director walked away from the film feeling more secure than ever. ""I had one gentleman sit down and say Nowadays we sit around and discuss scenarios. The 9/11 Commission said one of the reasons that happened is because we were unimaginative we werent prepared "" Fuqua recalled. ""And now they sit around and they discuss everything. Aliens could come and theyve talked about it."" In a way this movie is just another in a series of brainstorming sessions. ""[Its] just sort of a scenario of what could happen"" Fuqua said. ""But were in good hands with our guys. They know what theyre doing.""

It then jumps to nearly two straight hours of foreign invaders being tortured blown up and executed. It ends with the Stars and Stripes raised again in triumph over the White House. And the audience never stopped cheering. Occasionally I was one of them. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is that kind of film a well-made manipulative action picture smart enough to operate on some very atavistic levels. First show anonymous evil strangers hurting folks you identify with. Then have one true-blue character hit back hard. Its a movie made for fist pumps. Yet theres still something a little ugly about the film particularly about the shots explicitly evoking 9/11. (A low-flying plane heads toward a government building in D.C.; the Washington Monument collapses crumbling like one of the Twin Towers). It comes close to exploiting sacred memories -- and old fears -- for a buck. And as we mark 10 years since the start of the Iraq war and solemnly remember all the men and women killed there seeing familiar images from that era turned into cheap entertainment (or a subliminal recruitment ad) feels shameless no matter how undeniably effective it is. The movie is basically -- as Im sure it was pitched -- ""Die Hard in the White House."" A gang of ruthless Korean villains attack 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and take VIP hostages; they dont know a heroic profanely go-his-own-way ex-Secret Service man is already on the scene. And before you can say ""Yippee ki-yay Mr. President"" our lone wolf is on the prowl and taking down prey. Gerard Butler plays the hero and although his surliness was never a good match with the rom-coms Hollywood put him in hes fine here (although his obligatory ""tragic backstory"" is typically movie-star softened avoiding darker more interesting choices). Hes tough and capable and the rest of the cast is a far better-than-average roundup with Aaron Eckhart as the President -- guess things worked out for Harvey Dent after all -- and Ashley Judd Angela Bassett and Morgan Freeman among the supporting players. True the script doesnt always serve those players well. The attack requires rather improbably a gigantic military plane to violate American airspace as well as a supposedly beyond-suspicion traitor (whom I immediately suspected as soon as the character walked onscreen). And as for subtlety -- well WWII movies about the Nazis had more subtlety. Theres a lot of clumsily written dialogue about our way of life and a certain queasy racial subtext. In one scene a battered American even defiantly recites the Pledge of Allegiance as shes dragged off to execution by a gang of foreign devils. Thats over the top even here. But then director Antoine Fuqua loves over-the-top at least when it comes to warriors (his childhood dream was to be a fighter pilot he once confessed). ""Shooter"" ""Tears of the Sun"" even his ""King Arthur"" - all feature simple valiant heroes. (His view of the police -- ""Training Day"" ""Brooklyns Finest"" -- is far more complex.) Of course the Secret Service could use a little morale-boosting after last years Colombia call-girl scandal. And Fuqua surrounds his hero with plenty of action including a knock-out air attack on D.C. and some well-choreographed fight scenes. Its a solid simple more-bang-for-our-buck entertainment that doesnt ask us to think. But still maybe we should. Ratings note The film contains gory violence and strong language. Olympus Has Fallen (R) Film District (119 min.) Directed by Antoine Fuqua. With Gerard Butler Aaron Eckhart Morgan Freeman.

FilmDistrict hide caption toggle caption FilmDistrict Olympus Has Fallen Director Antoine Fuqua Genre Action Thriller Running Time 100 minutes Rated R for strong violence and language throughout With Gerard Butler Aaron Eckhart Morgan Freeman Rick Yune Melissa Leo Its probably best not to think of Olympus Has Fallen as a movie released in 2013. Antoine Fuquas film -- about a band of North Koreans who invade the White House -- feels from start to finish like a throwback to the action cinema and military thrillers of decades past. Its like an ersatz reproduction of an archaeological relic if the archaeologists in question had just thrown together a bunch of random artifacts from different eras taken a blurry photograph and then asked someone to make an accurate model based only on their memory of that photograph. The obvious reference point here is Die Hard with Gerard Butler stepping awkwardly into Bruce Willis shoes as Mike Banning the man trying to single-handedly thwart a hostage situation from the inside. Hes a disgraced Secret Service agent formerly part of the presidents detail now languishing in the apparent purgatory of the Treasury Department. But when a massive coordinated attack on the White House from the air and the ground leaves the president (Aaron Eckhart) held hostage in the basement of the building with most of his protection lying dead in the smoking ruins above Banning is the countrys last hope. At times the debt the film owes to Die Hard is so huge that it goes uncomfortably beyond homage and into wholesale theft. Try not to see Robert Forsters Joint Chiefs chairman as this films Police Chief Dwayne Robinson or the attempted Black Hawk attack on the White House as a direct quotation of the failed SWAT team assault in that movie. Bannings conversation with a villain disguising himself as a good guy in the house may as well have just inserted the analogous scene between Willis and Alan Rickman in the earlier film. But thats hardly the only source material. The jingoistic fear-mongering the maudlin nationalistic paeans to God and country? Straight out of Red Dawn. Theres a shout-out to 1950s B-movies with an Earth vs. the Flying Saucers-style attack on downtown D.C. and the resultant shortening of the Washington Monument. The nuclear-scare subplot comes complete with a White House doomsday device so ill-advised and poorly thought out that it seems designed specifically for an enemy to use against the U.S. It owes its debt to Dr. Strangelove but absent that films satirical edge it just seems nonsensical. That lack of any kind of self-aware winking is where the film fails. Its more ridiculous notions -- only two fighters are scrambled to divert an unregistered military transport heading straight for D.C. for instance and only threaten to shoot it down when its 30 seconds away from the National Mall -- might have been more excusable if there was any sense that Fuqua meant any of this in jest. With invading North Korean forces having laid waste to the White House U.S. House Speaker and Acting President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) leads a team seeking to rescue the president and restore order. FilmDistrict hide caption toggle caption FilmDistrict It has to be a joke right? The budget for the film was 130 million yet the CGI of D.C. being attacked looks little better than a CNN infographic and the sets look obviously constructed of hastily assembled drywall. If you spend that much money making something look like a cheap B-movie then there must be some self-aware parody going on. Yet everything is played with the straightest of faces. Sure Ill admit to gripping my armrest tight during a few sequences. The self-important humorlessness of the film which seems to beg the viewer to take the adventure seriously despite never earning it does play well in the action sequences. The producers wisely dont attempt to go for a PG-13 rating and the killing is as violent and unflinching as it would have to be for an attack like this to succeed. Theres a real sense that anyone here could die and that at least gives the film enough stakes to engage on a gut level. But it also creates some unpleasantly uncomfortable moments namely in a scene that plays the torture of captured enemies for both cheers and laughs both of which it rather nauseatingly received from the audience I watched with. But thats judging the film by 2013 standards in a time when we think about what a movies gleeful attitudes toward torture or its simplification or demonization of our enemies might say about us. Olympus Has Fallen belongs to a cinematic era when enemy stereotypes that tap into our deep anxieties about an unstable world are merely a shortcut to getting audiences to cheer at the raising of an American flag in the twinkling light of a new dawn. So Mission Accomplished ... I guess.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is everything an audience nostalgic for the Steven Seagal killfests of the 90s expects and deserves. Splosions. Shrapnel. White people being taken prisoner by nonwhite people then rescued by white people. Cheesy banter. A lead actor who grumbles his tough-guy dialogue like he knows hes The Man. Bodies riddled with bullets and a script riddled with cliches. Its a terrible movie so generic in plotting and execution that its very familiarity will allow some fans to convince themselves its not that bad. Gerard Butler his eyebrows in a consternated V plays a former presidential bodyguard demoted to a desk job after an accident on his watch scarred the First Family. He leaps back into action when a rogue force of North Koreans launch simultaneous air and ground assaults on the White House which is hosting the South Korean premier. The sequestration budget cuts must have really undermined Homeland Security since the protective response is about as successful as if Chief Wiggum led the charge. Missile defenses fizzle like soggy Roman candles. A phalanx of security men obligingly run into the barrage and fall like mannequins. Only Butler who has mastered the art of running serpentine through machine gun fire is left to take charge inside the darkened presidential residence. Wow is it ever darkened. About half the film unfolds in blackout conditions. Butler shoots and hand-to-hands his way through these grievously underlit corridors like a shadow puppet which underscores how two-dimensional his role is. A memorable action guy needs more than fists of fury he needs shtick. Butlers signature move is stabbing a knife into his adversarys head. Not much of a finishing move really. When he kicked the Persian diplomat down the well in ""300"" that was good shtick. Antoine Fuqua who peaked directing ""Training Day"" persuaded some capable actors to climb aboard this death raft. Theres Morgan Freeman doing his pensive frown as Speaker of the House who steps up as chief executive. Melissa Leo (""The Fighter"") breaks from her usual run of crass trailer-park gals to play the Secretary of Defense a tough Hillary Clinton type who gets a brutal walloping from the villains. Rick Yune reprises his North Korean megalomaniac role from the Bond film ""Die Another Day."" Aaron Eckhart plays the president as a useless blowhard who bellows that there will be no negotiating with these terrorists then caves in like a cheap tent when they start slapping his staff around. If they presented this character note or any of the plot points pilfered from ""Die Hard"" with a knowing wink this might have been an enjoyably self-referential romp. Unfortunately they give every evidence of taking it seriously and expecting us to do the same. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

The bad news is that the president invites the delegation to join him in the secure hideaway. But the visiting group also includes North Korean terrorists posing as South Korean security personnel. So the bad guys are not only inside the building theyre locked in with the nations leaders.Those leaders are tortured until they surrender parts of the countrys closely guarded nuclear codes. But given that one techie woman seems to be constantly manning a computer why doesnt she just crack the code? Everything else is equally implausible including the Beltway Armageddon.While some of the city is re-created believably its too bad nobody gave the same level of care to plot and dialogue.

"Olympus Has Fallen | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; olympus-has-fallen ) Olympus Has Fallen (United States 2013) March 21 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres irony to be found in the recognition that the best Die Hard to be released in 2013 isnt the franchises official entry A Good Day to Die Hard but the White House-based copycat Olympus Has Fallen. And while Gerard Butler is no Bruce Willis his Mike Banning is a better facsimile of John McClane than the guy Willis is pretending to play these days. Theres also an element of 24 to be found here although Butlers Banning unfettered by TV ratings is considerably more homicidal than Kiefer Sutherlands Jack Bauer. Despite being released in March Olympus Has Fallen offers all the staples of a big summer movie destruction on an epic scale plenty of shoot-outs and battle sequences and a kick-ass hero who despite being battered and bloodied never gives up. Although the films real-world credibility is shaky it works on its own terms. The suspension of disbelief bar isnt that difficult to clamber over. 9/11 shifted it down considerably for this sort of motion picture. These days the North Koreans have become the go-to movie bad guys (belatedly taking over the spot occupied by the Soviets during the Cold War). The rationale behind the decision is solid Hollywood films dont play in North Korea so theres no negative box office impact and there arent a lot of pro-Korean pundits out there pounding the pulpit. Olympus Has Fallen hedges its bets by describing the attackers as ""Korean terrorists"" rather than commandos associated with Kim Jong Uns government but itas a none-too-subtle sleight of hand. After all the goal of the villains is to reunite the peninsula by allowing North Koreas army to sweep south without the United States to impede them. Gerard Butler who has been slumming in a series of lifeless romantic comedies and other barely watchable productions breathes a little life back into his career by playing Mike Banning the lone secret service agent whos alive and active in the White House after a lightning-fast attack results in the president (Aaron Eckhart) and vice president being taken hostage. The special effects intensive sequence in which the White House falls also features a plane crashing into the Washington Monument and a fair amount of on-ground carnage as innocent bystanders are strafed by enemy fire. The sequence is well executed but this sort of thing isnt as fun as it was before 9/11. The storyline is simple Its up to Banning to help the presidents young son escape from the White House then when that is accomplished he has to go back and try to get out the Commander in Chief. The scenario is of the Die Hard variety with the action confined to a contained area the bad guys implementing a plan thats more convoluted than it initially appears to be and a traitor in the mix. Kang (Rick Yune) is no Hans Gruber but who is? Olympus Has Fallen loses some momentum toward the end. The fifteen minute climax feels a little rushed and the Red LED countdown is unnecessarily cheesy. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of Olympus Has Fallen is the level of violence. Banning is so brutal in the way he deals with enemy combatants that its almost refreshing. No pussyfooting around. No second chances. Do unto others as they would have done unto you if you hadnt gotten to them first. One scene in which Banning uses throat-slitting and other forms of torture makes it clear that he will do whats necessary. Director Antoine Fuqua once had an issue with studio interference when his hard-R King Arthur was neutered to get a PG-13. Theres never any question that Olympus Has Fallen is headed into R-rated territory. Unlike John McClane who was an everyman stuck in an extraordinary situation Banning is ex-special forces so hes well-suited for the killing from the shadows required of his character. Butlers approach to the role is a little dour - one cant help but wonder whether Olympus Has Fallen might have been a little more fun if the lead character was allowed a little more wit. Reliable actors like Aaron Eckhart Morgan Freeman Angela Bassett and Melissa Leo turn in competent supporting performances. Rick Yune is a little weak as the bad guy - hes not dominating or frightening enough. And Radha Mitchells part as Bannings wife should have been left on the cutting room floor. She serves no purpose other than to add a few minutes to the running time. I kept expecting her character to have some kind of payoff but there isnt one. This is hard-core high stakes action with an element of the cataclysmic spectacle incorporated to raise its profile. It delivers what it promises and by doing so puts to shame lesser movies that lack the courage of their convictions. Like Dredd it uses violence to spike the adrenaline-and-testosterone cocktail it offers.

Director Antoine Fuqua.Cast Gerard Butler Aaron Eckhart Morgan Freeman.Rating R for strong violence and language throughout. RELATED NEWS Qamp;A Angela Bassett drawn to Olympus director By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Fri Mar 22 2013 1013 AM Theres a lot of flag waving in ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Were talking actual literal flags new flags resplendently waving in the dawns early light bullet-riddled flags flags on fire flags trampled under the boots of foreign oppressors. Its all window dressing for the figurative flag waving that happens when you strip ""Die Hard"" of its intelligence and charm and instead serve up its lone wolf vs. foreign baddies premise with a side-serving of jingoism and destruction porn. An increasingly jowly Gerard Butler stars as Mike Banning a hardcore Secret Service agent turned desk jockey when through no fault of his own he fails to rescue the first lady from a tragic car accident. No longer able to stand the sight of the man who didnt magically generate super powers to stop a car from going over a bridge in a winter storm a pouty President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) confines his former protector to desk detail. After 18 months of paperwork Banning is itching for some action. Lucky for him North Korea has ants in its pants over decades of American intervention in its affairs. The hermit kingdom also suddenly has its act so together that the U.S. military cant manage to take down a single ancient-looking warplane as it approaches the White House (""Olympus"" doesnt just borrow plot lines from the 90s but special effects too). The enemy infiltrates the White House and soon the president vice president and key members of the cabinet (the ones with the nuclear codes natch) are holed in up a bunker with Korean baddie and Hans Gruber wannabe Kang (Rick Yune) who plans on keeping everyone alive for just as long as it takes to torture the codes out of them. With the military hobbled by the hostage situation Americans are sitting ducks for whatever Kang has planned for those nuclear codes. But who needs a military when Bannings skulking around the White House to single-handedly save the presidents son kill all the Koreans and whisk the commander in chief back to safety? Its as implausible and boneheaded as these things get which wouldnt be as big a problem if Banning had enough panache to take us along for the ride. But Butlers character is all paper-thin nationalist machismo. The first half of the film drags without doing any actual character building (Bannings got a wife whos pretty and blond and puts up with his crap and thats about it) so that when the lone-wolf shenanigans of the second half kick in theres no emotional investment. And youve really got to like the guy if youre going to get a visceral kick out of seeing him brain a Korean to death with a Lincoln bust or stab another Korean during a torture session while commanding him to divulge his secrets ""in English"" Some directorial panache wouldnt have hurt either. But director Antoine Fuqua has long since burned through the goodwill he earned with ""Training Day."" ""Olympus"" has a strictly director-for-hire vibe; anyone with access to a Roland Emmerich movie or two (namely ""Independence Day"") and a mad-libbed action script could have churned out something similar. Which raises the question If youre just going to rip off the action movies of yore why not rip off more of the good stuff? Reach the writer at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com.

By    Alonso Duralde on March 21 2013  1254 pm Follow aduralde Email Print Related The Croods Poised to Unseat Oz Capture Busy Box-Office Weekend ""Die Hard"" comes to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. with this thrilling but dopey action flick that keeps things moving even while it defies logic As Criticwire recently pointed out the years after 1988 were littered with ""Die Hard"" knock-offs set in or on buses (""Speed"") aircraft carriers (""Under Siege"") hockey arenas (""Sudden Death"") and Air Force One (""Air Force One""). A quarter-century later ""Die Hard"" finally comes to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. with ""Olympus Has Fallen"" a thrilling but dopey action flick that keeps things moving even while it defies logic and slavishly follows the barefoot-Bruce-Willis formula. This time around the Lone Renegade Whos Our Only Hope is Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) a high-ranking Secret Service agent who got bounced to Treasury a year and a half earlier after he made the tough choice to save the life of President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) in a car accident even though it meant losing the First Lady (Ashley Judd). During a White House visit by the South Korean premier a well-orchestrated attack on Washington D.C. sees a plane fly into the Washington Monument while terrorists take the president and his advisors hostage in the bunker beneath the White House. Banning sneaks in during a firefight and winds up being the only link with the outside world communicating via the presidents satellite phone with the head of the Secret Service (Angela Bassett) a blustery general (Robert Forster) at the Pentagon and the Speaker of the House (Morgan Freeman). The latter is acting chief executive while the prez and VPOTUS are being held hostage -- but relax everyone its Morgan Freeman. (The cool-headed Freeman and Bassett essentially play Reginald VelJohnson to Butlers Bruce Willis while Forster is the Paul Gleason.) The villainous plot leads inevitably to the bright red countdown clock that features in so many action movies and the terrorists scheme has so many holes that its best not to ask questions. Subsequently director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") provides explosions and gun battles (R-rated blood-splattery gun battles its worth noting) with enough frequency to paper over the gaps in the script by first-timers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt. With all this rushing about and blowing things up however the movie skirts past some potentially interesting subplots; for example its established early on that the presidents young son (Finley Jacobsen) knows all the secret ins and outs of the White House after hanging out with Mike and the rest of the security detail. Hes set up as a character akin to Eric Sheas in ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and we figure hell outfox the bad guys and maybe even help save the day but no -- hes found by Mike and rescued in fairly short order. Of course this is a movie where national monuments are blown up and soldiers and innocent civilians get killed by bullets and debris as though 9/11 never happened so its no surprise that so much of the movie feels like it was chucked onto the screen without much forethought. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" ranks among the best movies that Butler has ever made but thats damning with faint praise. He occasionally slips into his native Scottish brogue and no one apparently felt like ADR-ing over it. (Another minor mistake that no one bothered to fix was the TV news lower-third that reads ""Terrorist [sic] Attack The Whitehouse [sic]."") There are tons of talented actors slumming here including Melissa Leo Radha Mitchell Cole Hauser and Dylan McDermott but theyre not called upon to do much. (Many of them spend the film literally phoning it in or at least shouting into a walkie-talkie.) Yes youll guess who the secret turncoat is within the first five minutes of the movie and youll roll your eyes over some of the scripts lazier ideas and moments of ""America F--k Yeah"" jingoism. But you wont be bored by ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and if youre in the mood for some trashy adventure the movie makes up in adrenaline what it lacks in brains. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

We dont really need to see the first familys home and the nations Capitol under siege do we? Have no fear. Any semblance of seriousness and verisimilitude suggested by the marketing campaign is quickly forgotten once director Antoine Fuquas enjoyably tacky Die Hard-on-the-Potomac gets under way. Gerard Butler brooding and burly is Olympus Has Fallens John McClane - a tarnished Secret Service agent with a desk job at the Treasury. A desk that just happens to look onto the front gate of the White House. When truckloads of demon commandos start spilling across the lawn mowing down guards and making for the portico Butlers Mike Banning is already hoofing it over there dodging bullets and warning bystanders to take cover. He uses the F-word a lot too which must be part of his Secret Service training. Aaron Eckhart an actor with the gravitas of a duck is President Benjamin Asher who has just welcomed the president of South Korea and his entourage when the assault begins. Quick to the bunker Unfortunately among the VIPs shunted into the underground command center - along with the vice president (Phil Austin) and the secretary of defense (Melissa Leo) - is Kang (Rick Yune) who is not in fact an attache with the South Korean delegation but a crazed terrorist mastermind. Its only a matter of hours before he has the secret codes to the U.S. nuclear arsenal at his fingertips. But wait - Mike Banning is in the Oval Office poking through the presidents desk. And hes got the boss of the Secret Service (Angela Bassett) on his headset and shes in a situation room with the speaker of the House (Morgan Freeman acting presidential) and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs (Robert Forster cussing up a storm). Let Banning see whats up and whether he can rescue the First Whippersnapper. Yes the presidents son (Finley Jacobsen) is somewhere in the White House hiding out. Olympus Has Fallen offers a shooter games worth of bad guys to dispose of - one of which Banning klunks on the noggin with a bust of Lincoln. Wave upon wave of the terrorists (part of a North Korean splinter group) get their necks cracked or get shot or get the chance to engage in choreographed hand-to-hand combat with Banning. And meanwhile Kang is busy torturing Ashers cabinet - the veep the defense chief. And Radha Mitchell as Bannings wife a hospital nurse busy with the emergency room deluge across town wonders whether her husband is all right. All right? Hes sworn to protect the commander in chief no matter how many crazy North Korean guerrillas get thrown at him. Which way to the map room? Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Saving America and Gerard Butlers career in Olympus Has Fallen review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSaving America and Gerard Butlers career in Olympus Has Fallen reviewNo cliche is too outrageous in Olympus Has Fallen.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 21 2013Olympus Has FallenStarring Gerard Butler Aaron Eckhart Morgan Freeman Rick Yune Melissa Leo and Angela Bassett. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. 119 minutes. Opens March 22 at major theatres. 14AThe White House is occupied by North Korean terrorists the U.S. President is held hostage and millions of Americans face nuclear annihilation -- but can we focus on the real emergency here people?Olympus Has Fallen may well be the career last stand for actor/producer Gerard Butler whose recent strings of bombs have toppled him from the heroic heights of 300 to the rom-com depths of Playing for Keeps.Article Continued BelowThe Scottish stallion is box-office poison and he and director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) surely know it. Together they shamelessly and successfully turn this hoary ""Die Hard in the White House"" action scenario into something approaching diverting entertainment even as institutions crumble heads explode and bodies stack with sickening intensity.No cliche is too outrageous for them or for screenwriters Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt in the mission to build up Butler while at the same time bucking up sagging American morale. Theres a kid in jeopardy Old Glory tattered and tossed the president (Aaron Eckhart) and his peeps bound and battered and the Washington Monument sliced n diced -- and thats just to get your blood up.Olympus Has Fallen also features the most stereotypical portrayals of fearsome foreigners since rapacious Russians and surly Arabs lit up 1980s cinema. The rogue North Koreans led by leering maniac Kang (Rick Yune a former Bond villain) are so jaw-droppingly evil the only thing they dont do is dropkick the presidential puppy off the White House balcony.They give Butlers one-man army ""disgraced"" Secret Service ace Mike Banning ample excuse to kick ass slice throats and impale skulls as he seeks to save his career the president and America in that order. I put ""disgraced"" in quotes because Olympus Has Fallen loves to have it both ways (and this includes having two presidents the real one played by Eckhart and the acting one played by Morgan Freeman as House Speaker).A prologue shows us Banning manfully attending to an emergency that threatens the lives of the president and first lady (Ashley Judd). Jump ahead six months and Banning is an outcast banished to a desk job at the Treasury Department as punishment for a tragedy not of his making.But who you gonna call when the godless Commies launch a coordinated air and ground assault on Washington D.C. the White House and the nations nuclear-defense system in scenes that chillingly evoke the horror of 9/11? Maybe not Banning who is still in the doghouse. But when he manages to force his way into the occupied White House literally leaping over the bodies of tourists police and guards killed in the attack he becomes ""the best hope youve got"" to redeem himself to avert nuclear catastrophe and to close ""the gates of Hell"" (say this last bit with Morgan Freeman authority).It all goes down shockingly well even if Butler lacks the sarcastic wit of a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger and even as the film keeps upping the eye-rolling quotient with cartoon characters. We get Angela Bassett as a tight-assed Secret Service director Robert Forster as a stiff-necked general and Melissa Leo as an attention-grabbing Secretary of Defense. We also get Radha Mitchell once an action woman (Pitch Black) now reduced to playing the role of Bannings long-suffering wife. In the films silliest moment (and there are many) she gets a cell phone call from hubby taking a break from booting North Korean butt who tells her that hes gonna have to miss date night yet again honey. He has a nation to rescueIts impossible to watch Olympus Has Fallen without pondering what effect this racially provocative movie will have on real-life relations between the U.S. and North Korea which are the opposite of friendly at the moment.And you cant help wondering if were all being used by a film that could double as a dandy PSA for the CIA FBI and Homeland Security. Americas top spooks are undoubtedly very happy to scare the pants off Americans (and their budget-conscious Congressmen) who might otherwise dare question the billions spent on defense and security. Didja see how easily those savages invaded the White House? You dont want that to happen do ya?Lets not forget our No. 1 concern can Olympus Has Fallen revive the career of Gerard Butler? The box office will rule (Im betting the film does gangbusters) but if all else fails theres surely a spot in the roster for the burly Scot in the next chapter of The Expendables.Read more about United StatesThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Gerard Butler (left) is a Secret Service agent protecting the president (Aaron Eckhart) when both are hostages in the White House. Photo Phil Caruso FilmDistrict Olympus Has Fallen review Satisfying 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Olympus Has Fallen Drama. Starring Gerard Butler Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. (R. 118 minutes.) ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is about as satisfying an action thriller as can be hoped for with an irresistible premise and nothing but follow-through all the way to the finish. Its too derivative to be a classic - practically an uncredited remake of ""Die Hard"" - but such a work of craftsmanship as to command respect at times even awe. Its that wonderful totally unambitious yet satisfying thing a really good movie. Lets just hope that theres nothing accurate about it and that theyre all laughing it up in Washington because if you believe ""Olympus Has Fallen"" it really wouldnt be all that difficult for terrorists to take over the White House. They would just need a fighter plane 50 or so guys with automatic weapons and a handful of traitors to work the inside. Plus the all-important element of surprise. Obviously that would all take some doing but the movie makes you feel that such a thing is at least possible. The film has the sheen of a first-rate production. Director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") turns the whole invasion scene into an extended wrenching sequence. The enemy plane flying low over Washington blasting pedestrians with machine-gun fire announces the movies terms - it will pull no punches and its going to be bloody. The fight for the White House is brutal and pulse-pounding and theres no question that the sight of one of our defining structures getting defiled by bullets and missiles is disturbing on a primal level. Think ""Die Hard"" with a touch of ""Air Force One"" As in the latter movie the president is held captive on his home turf. As in the former a lone capable good guy is in the building where the hostages have been taken. This time the building is the White House. The enemy is a North Korean terrorist and the main hostage is the young and vigorous president of the United States (Aaron Eckhart). Gerard Butler plays Banning a hardened Secret Service agent who never quits. How tough is Banning? Hes the kind of guy who not only kills multiple henchmen but gets a big kick out of taunting the chief terrorist Kang (Rick Yune) with wisecracks and threats. But wait ... That sounds familiar a lot like Bruce Willis doesnt it? Also like Willis in a famous scene from ""Die Hard"" Banning warns the authorities not to try to land helicopters on the roof but do they listen? Such obvious sourcing keeps ""Olympus Has Fallen"" out of the classic pantheon. As Banning Butler isnt as funny or as charming as Willis but as one politician once said of another hes likable enough. Butlers chief asset is his violence. It is easy to believe in his anger and just as easy to believe that he would kill all those people. As action heroes go next to Butler in this movie Willis is a pacifist. Ashley Judd makes a sparkling first lady and Melissa Leo is superb - and barely recognizable - as an angry and desperate secretary of defense. Morgan Freeman has a nice supporting turn as the tough-talking speaker of the House who finds out that its easier to talk tough when you have no power than it is to be tough when faced with life-and-death choices.

R Strong violence and language. Area theaters. It may still be chilly outdoors but summer has definitely started inside the cineplex. Antoine Fuquas ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is the sort of brainless brawny action thriller that usually thrives in air-conditioning. Gerard Butler makes a mighty attempt to hide his Scottish accent as ultrapatriot Mike Banning a former presidential guard assigned to desk work after a tragic accident occurs on his watch. Banning is still shuffling papers on July 5 when North Korean terrorists attack Washington and take the President (Aaron Eckhart) hostage. With all other agents compromised he makes his way inside a destroyed White House and finds himself the last man standing. From a safe distance the Speaker of the House (Morgan Freeman) and the Secret Service director (Angela Bassett) issue several requests of Banning to sneak the Presidents young son (Finley Jacobsen) out of the building; kill all the terrorists including their leader (standout Rick Yune); and rescue the President. For a guy like Banning this is just a days work. Fuqua (""Training Day"") knows exactly how to pump up a straightforward script from first-time scribes Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt. Theres lots of firepower and plenty of hand-to-hand combat but Fuqua also makes the siege feel frighteningly real. Its inevitable that at some point during the movie youll wonder whether a version of this terrifying attack could actually happen. Gerard Butler goes into action in Olympus Has Fallen. Its too bad then that the rest of the film doesnt rise to the same level. Visual references to 9/11 represent a low point in a project built on brazenly calculated nationalism. Each character feels pulled from a screenwriter playbook and few of the actors push beyond two dimensions. (The supporting cast includes Dylan McDermott Ashley Judd Radha Mitchell and an overemoting Melissa Leo as the secretary of defense.) Meanwhile Hollywood is determined to force the bland Butler on us a play-it-safe move that seems increasingly desperate. Are we so lacking in action heroes that this stolid mass of muscle is the best we get? More imaginative casting (Chris Hemsworth? Garrett Hedlund? Gina Carano?) might have turned a decent Friday-night fallback choice into a truly rousing blockbuster. Still perhaps every generation gets the movie stars it deserves. ""Olympus"" has quite a bit to say about the current state of our country. Intentions aside not all of it is entirely flattering.

"Movie review Olympus Has Fallen - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Olympus Has Fallen is Die Hard at the White House Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent | 03.22.13 | 110 PM Its not as if its taboo to mine the American presidency for outrageous popcorn-movie entertainment. Recall Harrison Ford as a two-fisted commander in chief in ""Air Force One"" or freshly sprung president/hostage Donald Pleasence grabbing an Uzi at the end of ""Escape From New York."" We could also talk about ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" but lets not. Now comes ""Olympus Has Fallen"" which casts Gerard Butler in ""Die Hard"" mode as a Secret Service agent left to single-handedly rescue the president (Aaron Eckhart) from North Korean terrorists whove taken the White House. But this is no Bruce Willis smirkfest. Were halfway through the movie before director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") starts giving Butler the occasional dark quip and by that time its an insufficient weapon. Pop jingoism isnt easy to stir once youve established a vibe thats so deflating. In a post-9/11 world how do you show catastrophic imagery of the Washington Monument crashing down (at the hands of someone other than aliens at least) and then invite the audience to hop aboard for a rah-rah thrill ride? Awkwardly thats how. Related Links Find showtimes and theaters Hollywoods most memorable movie presidents ""Olympus"" opens with Butlers Mike Banning forced to make a terrible choice when a caravan carrying the president and the first lady (Ashley Judd) meets with calamity. Its an episode that could have been an entire movie -- arguably a smarter one. How best to serve a man whos not only leader of the free world but your home-gym sparring buddy on Camp David weekends? (Take that ""Mad Hops"" Obama.) Banning does his duty and saves his bosss life but at what cost to the president? And to himself? Though the questions are there to ponder the script just plows ahead to show that Banning has been shunted over to a job in the Treasury Department relegated to life on the outside looking in. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Is Banning a burnout destined to stumble into a second chance? A patriotic redemption seeker determined to create that chance? An action-junkie headcase with a flair for one-liners? Butler whose meat-and-potatoes heroism deserves a little love beyond the ""300"" fanboy ranks seems up for exploring the answers. But the movie flashes these various takes without making the effort to commit to any of them. No time you know? The North Koreans are hitting D.C. in an extended Trojan horse-style siege. The plausibility is shaky - and before getting into broader ""informed"" geopolitical allusions maybe they couldve corrected a TV news graphic teasing a ""Whitehouse"" update -- but its an unsettling exercise in living-nightmare screen mayhem anyway. The rest is disaster movie gloss. Rick Yune who played a Bond villain in ""Die Another Day"" essentially plays one again as the terrorists showboating leader. Eckharts prez says hell never (ever) surrender secret missile codes then promptly caves. Morgan Freeman steps in as acting president (remember ""Deep Impact"" where his presidential casting was progressive?) and frets with Washington heavyweights Angela Bassett and Robert Forster. Melissa Leos defense secretary blubbers under torture -- or maybe at the thought that this is what an Oscar for ""The Fighter"" nets you. Butler serves the cause well considering. Think that cause is a thankless one? Shhh dont tell Secret Service agent Channing Tatum or president Jamie Foxx headed your way in June with yes ""White House Down.""

Hunched over as I was my hat fell off my head landing on the floor. ""Olympus has fallen"" I shouted. ""Repeat Olympus has fallen"" Despite having not seen one trailer or TV commercial I was certain that this exact line reading was sure to come during the film. In this and all other matters of predictability I was not to be disappointed. Antoine Fuquas (""Training Day"") new film stars Gerard Butler as John McToughguy (probably not the actual characters name) the best Secret Service agent there is. Hes no longer in the direct employ of the President (Aaron Eckhart evoking Bill Pullman) because part of being the best Secret Service agent there is means rescuing the President from an SUV thats dangling over the side of an icy bridge and doing so at the expense of the First Lady (who the film refuses to admit was probably already dead). 18 months or so after the accident Butler has been demoted to a desk job at the Treasury department (POTUS recognizes him as a hero but just cant bear to see him). From his window Butler can still see the White House (code name ""Olympus"") where the action and the scampy First Son are. When the South Korean delegation comes for an important state meeting thats actually a Trojan horse of terrorist activity Butlers being on the outside saves him from the first line of destruction. A massive bomber jet sanitation trucks with high-end machine guns suicide bombers and detailed knowledge of the White Houses interior all lead to the brutal ""unionist"" Korean (Rick Yune) holding the Prez and his top brass hostage in an underground bunker. Bullets and brains fly everywhere and the Speaker of the House (Morgan Freeman) now acting President has a ticking clock to remove troops from the DMZ and the 7th Fleet from the Pacific. ""Come out to D.C. well get together have a few laughs..."" Yeah its ""Die Hard"" in the White House but there are definitely worse places to set a ""Die Hard"" knock-off (see ""A Good Day to Die Hard"". Better yet dont). Time is running out. Downstairs secret codes are being extracted (hey leave Secretary of Defense Melissa Leo alone you brute) while upstairs Gerard Butler is working overtime as a blunt killing machine. He has none of the verbal panache of Bruce Willis John McClane and Eckhart isnt given any resonant koans like ""get off my plane"" but the tension and release of each kill brought cheers from the bread and circuses crowd at my papered theatrical screening. If you cant figure out who the mole on the American side is by the three minute mark of ""Olympus Has Fallen"" I suppose there are some surprises in store for you. Despite such narrative shortcomings the bone-breaking fisticuffs are propulsive enough to keep you from making too many inquiries. Like ""how does Butler know all about the secret Hydra weapons which Secret Service Director Angela Bassett doesnt know about but not the Cerberus weapons which she does know about?"" Or ""why hasnt the White House changed its security codes after 18 months?"" Or ""why does Butler still have thumbprint access even though he was dismissed?"" Or ""why do the Koreans know about everything except the air conditioner shaft to the bushes?"" With luck you wont care. Nor will you care when the big bad mole explains his treason by shouting incoherently about ""globalism and fking Wall Street"" The action is the real star here and its all good enough. It isnt great - the aerial special effects are distractingly cheap - but at least theres lots of it on display. So if you have an uncle who hasnt seen a movie since ""Taken"" hes gonna love this one. Whether or not being in a darkened theater as people cheer knives plunging into Asian foreheads and tattered American flags are hoisted to rousing horns gives you a lump in your throat or a serious case of the willies is entirely your call and youre likely to apply much more thought to the matter than the filmmakers ever did.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The secretary of defense has just taken an awful beating. Eyes bloodshot blood crusted around her nose and mouth doubled over in pain she seeks to reassure the president whos bound up next to her with his hands above his head awaiting his turn. The terrorists must have the nuclear launch code and theyre prepared to nipple-twist the information out of him if necessary. The secretary leans over to him asking ""Hows... my... hair?"" The president replies ""Not a strand out of place."" And there is but one example of why American thrillers involving the president--Absolute Power Murder At 1600 Deterrence Independence Day Air Force One etc.--are doomed to be completely ridiculous. Hackneyed scenes like the one above happen all the time in Die Hard knockoffs like Olympus Has Fallen but theyre shrugged off more easily when they dont involve the leader of the free world and a top Cabinet member. The opening scene has the president played by Aaron Eckhart trading blows with top Secret Service agent Gerard Butler in what appears to be the official White House boxing ring. This is not some ineffectual ""pen is mightier than the sword"" type the film implies but a leader who signs bills with bruised knuckles and will literally stand and fight against tyranny. Affirming the Red Dawn remakes silly idea that an isolationist country like North Korea would carry out a brazen attack on American soil Olympus Has Fallen has North Korean terrorists infiltrating a South Korean diplomatic entourage and going after the White House directly. After an air attack sends the president the vice president (Phil Austin) and the secretary of defense (Melissa Leo) to an underground bunker another terrorist unit emerges to hold them hostage. The line of succession puts the speaker of the House (Morgan Freeman) in charge but his only man on the inside is John McClane Butler who disappointed the president in an earlier crisis but seeks redemption by playing the fly in the ointment. He also has a wife (Radha Mitchell) whos a little miffed at him because that happened in Die Hard too. Nearly everything that happens in Olympus Has Fallen is ludicrous yet because the fate of the president and the nation hangs in the balance the crisis is treated with the gravitas of Paul Scofield at the West End. The combination all but pumps laughing gas into the theater as Trevor Morris score pounds with percussion director Antoine Fuqua cuts away to a fraying American flag and a rogue North Korean ideologue drives the country to the brink of nuclear holocaust. The one and only consolation for audiences is that the end of the world would never ever happen this way.

Cut past the pics superficial patriotism and the message is ironically clear Never outsource your visual effects when a domestic shop will do. Courageously representing the human element in this mostly digital assault on American soil Gerard Butler holds his own as a one-man-army. Millennium was wise to push this grim act-of-war movie out three months ahead of Columbias like-minded ""White House Down."" In June auds will see how Roland Emmerich whose ""Independence Day"" gleefully made things go boom at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. handles the task today. For the moment the post-9/11 memory of real attacks on American targets still hits a bit too close to home. And though Hollywoods jaunty disaster-movie days may have passed this lower-budget entry comes with the satisfaction of evening the score before end credits roll. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" helmer Fuqua whos known for bringing an unflinching toughness to inner cities (""Training Day"") and ancient history (""King Arthur"") sticks to the ""Die Hard"" model here minus most of the tossed-off one-liners. In ex-Special Forces pro Mike Banning Butler presents a gritty but humorless hero who cusses bleeds and occasionally pauses to remove shards of glass from his wounds. To raise the personal stakes Creighton Rothenbergers script opens with a prologue in which Banning saves the life of President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart who looks the part of a Wall St.-friendly commander in chief) but fails to protect the First Lady (Ashley Judd) -- a tragedy that leaves the redemption-seeking secret service agent reassigned to desk duty. Bannings chance to square the books with Asher arrives when heavily armed guerillas swarm the White House led by the undercover Kang (""Die Another Days"" Rick Yune). While a massive CG warplane flies low over D.C. gunning down pedestrians and blasting the top off the Washington Monument turncoat Forbes (Dylan McDermott) helps Kang and his men take the president and his top staffers (including Melissa Leos unyielding Secretary of Defense) captive in the White Houses underground safe room. Hokey glimpses of tourists attempting to outrun blocks of falling granite make the lo-fi effects of an earlier era look realistic by comparison. As pedestrians run for cover or die in the crossfire Banning makes his way into the fray searching for the presidents missing son (Finley Jacobson) before worrying about the kidnapped world leaders. With Asher incapacitated and his veep brutally executed before the eyes of the militarys top brass the shot-calling role falls to the Speaker of the House played by Morgan Freeman an actor with experience at holding the reins of power having occupied the Oval Office in ""Deep Impact."" Freeman demonstrates due gravitas steeling his nerves with a strong cup of coffee while the small army of character actors around him hang their heads in desperation. Fuquas widescreen approach -- which offers ample room for all that vidgame-quality CG -- relishes such cornball iconography featuring shots of the American flag pierced with bullets or tumbling slowly to the ground against a flame-red sunset while Trevor Morris drum-corps score keeps things sounding duly martial. Banning earns well-deserved cheers for using a heavy bust of Lincolns head to bust in a baddies noggin. Though not as exciting as the White House-storming seventh season of ""24"" the high-concept project alternates between brawny action movie and crudely considered ""what if"" scenario. Despite the pics one-on-many focus Fuqua approaches it as a full-blown war movie incorporating the militarys latest toys into large-scale shootouts between squads of anonymous opponents. Sadly those crude Bulgarian-rendered effects arent much more convincing than the recent White-House-in-the-crosshairs propaganda videos pouring out of North Korea. Butler brings things back to a more practical level as his butt-kicking hero shoots stabs and punches his way through to the commander-in-distress only to face off against a foreign-rigged computer program in the final scene.

Emilian says February 28 2016 at 1218 pm I think the bulgarian VFX are great and realistic. Apparently mr Peter Debruge is not familiar with VFX technology and methods. So he better stick his opinion as a critic to the story of the movie and not show his negligence trying to talk about matters he does not understand. Reply Craig says April 14 2013 at 940 pm Apparently a certain movie critic does not care much for Bulgaria. What a bizarrely written review.

I. Joe is going to blow your mind. I saw it last night and want to see it again. I dont watch a movie a second time unless it has more to see a second time because it is carrying you through on a rollercoaster. G. I Joe did that. Reply jamesat17 says March 23 2013 at 429 pm I saw the movie and it was really good. All the actors did their parts really well. I saw no problem with the CGI affects. Making the affects of a building falling on people well it looked like they did their best. How many of you would run out of a door when in front of you a couple of dozen other people have been gunned down? Wouldnt you do as the main actor did and get behind a wall and shoot from there? If that were the type of people that are guarding the WH then we are all in for the same kind of fall by making others think they can take over with ease. That scene lasted for a few minutes and all that time I was thinking how stupid can people be. Even before that scene was over I leaned over to my friend and mentioned that the others were going to run out of the building thinking they were going to stop a machine gun. Of course they had to get it down to just the main actor but come on. Give us a movie of the same story line and make us stand up out of our seats because it looks so real that people walk out of the theater. Reply pleasedontseethismovie says March 24 2013 at 1059 pm The CGI looked like I was watching someone play Sim City or something. This was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Reply prem says March 23 2013 at 846 am so the next time some wonderful vfx comes up in a movie  can i expect the reviewer to name the country and give it praise? Reply Michael AvMen says March 22 2013 at 1110 pm Seriously. The only Bad CGI was the plane But you would Never Know that the Entire Film Was done in Shreveport LA.... All of it. The CGI White House and DC areas are all Plate Shots VFX.. So Not So bad now.. Huh? I have a Small Scene at the Very End that Actualy made the Final Cut.. Michael AvMen ( I stand Right behind Banning at the End When the Presidents Gives his Address to the nation.) Sorry for the Spoiler. Reply Xenophobic Reviewer says March 21 2013 at 122 pm The underlying message of the reviewers rant against Bulgarian VFX would seem to be that unless your VFX are done in California you cant expect quality. That basic premise is untrue of course. Visual effects is a global industry and VFX artists and companies from New Zealand UK France and Canada all have proven capable of delivering high caliber work. Two of the companies listed on this film are known to do sub-contract work for ILM regularly. This reviewer is either uninformed or hes chosen a sensationalistic headline to jump on the VFX Solidarity movement bandwagon. Reply Zdravkov says March 21 2013 at 1215 pm In all fairness 49 out of the 115 names under the ""Visual Effects by"" title are indeed Bulgarian so theres obviously merit to the catchy headline. But the author neglects to mention the connivance of the studios and the fact that the majority of VFX work was handled on American soil. Blaming the Bulgarians for the outcome is tantamount to blaming Chinese sweatshop workers for the quality of a knock-off one bought at half the price of the original. Clearly this is not a question of the products ""made in"" stamp but of the purchasers standards and willingness to pay for quality. The VFX in Life of Pi Argo and Cloud Atlas also have Bulgarian participation but no nation-specific praise has resulted from that. Obviously this is a matter of corporate greed and simplifying it down to a level of ""domestic"" vs ""foreign"" only means that some of the pics superficial patriotism has found its way into the article. Now pass me some freedom fries please. Reply P-Fi says March 21 2013 at 1030 am The point of what the reviewer is trying to say is that you cant put budget low quality ""visual effects"" in a movie and not expect people to notice. The ""visual effects"" play as important a role in movies today as its major stars. Even more so in some cases. Im sure there are great artists in Bulgaria Louisiana Toronto and the other regions where the VFX was made. However with no money this is what you will get. Visual Effects artists and companies are being under appreciated and very poorly treated these days. It has to stop. Thank you Peter Debruge for helping bring this to light. Reply Cobra Commander says March 21 2013 at 1005 am Yeah and Ghost FX isnt even Bulgarian but a Danish company. They have done some excellent work on other pics. But apparently that doesnt matter as long as the headline is catchy ... Reply Rusty says March 21 2013 at 946 am It does sound like someone has an axe to grind about vfx work being outsourced to foreign countries it isnt like this happened overnight. The problem is not who does the work or where but the painfully short post-schedule in which to do it in. Either way go and see the film and make up your own minds. Reply cris says March 20 2013 at 937 pm Obviously this reviewer didnt do his research...The louisiana branch also worked on this movie... Reply Justin Kanowicz says March 20 2013 at 550 pm This is less a review then a spoiler filled screed against the Bulgarians. Reply Sheesh says March 20 2013 at 529 pm Whoa Spoilers much? Reply HybridHalo says March 20 2013 at 527 pm A lot is made of the VFX work in this film not being American though all of the shots youve mentioned as being stand-out poor were handled by Millenniums Louisiana studio. In the light of the level of output its looking like theyre trying to distance themselves and blame the Bulgaria side of the group. Convenient. Reply hybridhalo says March 20 2013 at 528 pm In a follow up to that comment you only need to go as far as the films imdb page to see the studios attached to the VFX on the film  http//www.imdb.com/title/tt2302755/fullcredits Reply jamesat17 says March 20 2013 at 330 pm Anytime you blow up the WH well Im game for that. Reply Ben M says March 20 2013 at 307 pm Yes Effects can go horribly wrong when theyre done on the cheap but lets not forget that several recent Oscars for Visual Effects have gone to London and New Zealand. Just because its not American doesnt make the quality poor by default. Reply Brett says March 20 2013 at 301 pm Tell this to the studios..... Reply Brad says March 20 2013 at 218 pm Nice to see someone aknowledge the hard work on American Artists...... or in this case the lack of it Reply Dave Millnick says March 20 2013 at 145 pm Yeah just from the trailer one could tell the CGI looked cheap.

This film image released by FilmDistrict shows from left Aaron Eckhart Gerard Butler Finley Jacobsen Angela Bassett and Robert Forster in a scene from ""Olympus Has Fallen."" (AP Photo/FilmDistrict Phil Caruso) ( Phil Caruso ) The bloody operation masterminded by a fashionable villain (Rick Yune) yields a high body count and bends plausibility as a former Secret Service agent (Gerald Butler) stages a one-man Bruce Willis yippie-ki-yay counteroffensive in the battered bullet-splattered Oval Office. Meanwhile the speaker of the House (Morgan Freeman naturally) assumes command of the U.S. while the president is literally tied up. At the speakers side are the rational head of the Secret Service (Angela Bassett) and a gung-ho general (Robert Forster) dispensing questionable input.Advertisement The setup has an absurd ""Red Dawn"" sheen to it but Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") makes it so lean and mean it doesnt matter. The highly stylized director takes advantage of focusing on damaged American icons -- a tattered flag is flung off a balcony; the Washington Monument gets whacked by a plane. All of it effectively rouses our red-white-and-blue dander. The films greatest coup -- along with a surefire cast -- is the production design. The Oval Office re-created by designer Derek Hill (Oliver Stones ""W"") in Louisiana is such a convincing stand-in that it strikes a patriotic nerve as we watch the sacred institution get battered.The White House becomes part of more cinematic action in two other films -- next weekends ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" and Junes ""White House Down."" How will ""Olympus Has Fallen"" stack up? Who cares?Theres no reason to overthink this. Just leave your brain at the lobby and enjoy 2013s most entertaining thriller yet. This film image released by FilmDistrict shows Gerard Butler in a scene from ""Olympus Has Fallen.""

By employing a rogue fighter jet a handful of suicide bombers a garbage truck with a hidden machine gun and one very highly placed saboteur. Thats the grabby ""innovative"" section of this otherwise brutally routine Die Hard-in-the-White-House thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) with his usual slam-bang cutthroat aggression but with almost nothing in the way of surprise or genuine organic suspense. In Air Force One Harrison Ford made a powerfully convincing U.S. president; Aaron Eckhart not so much. (He seems more like a testy press secretary on some rerun of The West Wing.) Nevertheless the movie keeps rubbing our noses in how high the stakes are with ominous images of a tattered Old Glory used to symbolize the impending ""fall of America."" The terrorist ringleader named Kang is played by the sleekly handsome Rick Yune as a taunting geopolitical sociopath who orders the U.S. to remove its troops from the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas then threatens to detonate all of Americas nuclear weapons. Very grand plans indeed though theyre not especially tricky or interesting and neither is Yunes one-note smug performance. The movie cuts back and forth between the secret underground White House bunker where Kang torments the hostages (including a meant-to-be-Hillaryesque secretary of defense played by an overly hysterical Melissa Leo) and a war room presided over by Morgan Freeman as the Speaker of the House. The countdown-to-Armageddon structure generates almost no tension but Olympus Has Fallen does have lots of squalidly bloody hand-to-hand action all of which is so pulpy and standardthat the film actually makes you grateful for the presence of Gerard Butler gnashing his teeth in the Bruce Willis role.

Directed at a jingoistic fever pitch by Training Days Antoine Fuqua Olympus Has Fallenquickly hurtles through the bare minimum of exposition--a square-jawed newly widowed POTUS (Aaron Eckhart); a brooding ex-Secret Service hotshot (Gerard Butler) who blames himself for the First Ladys death--before unleashing a small army of North Korean baddies on Pennsylvania Avenues most desirable address. What follows is an all-you-can-eat buffet of shlock from the retroRobocop-era visual effects to the Delta Force-worthy parade of Oscar winners and nominees in peril (Secretary of State Melissa Leo Speaker of the House Morgan Freeman Secret Service Director Angela Bassett Army Chief of Staff Robert Forster) to the utterly shameless 9/11 imagery (including Beltway tourists crushed by chunks of an imploding Washington Monument). A Red Dawn for the Tea Party era Olympus Has Fallen is pretty ridiculously entertaining--or at least entertainingly ridiculous--for long stretches dulled only by the realization that there are many parts of the country where this will play as less than total farce.Slideshow 15 Movie Presidents We Wish Were RealFollow VoiceFilmClub Film Details Olympus Has Fallen RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time120 More Info Trailer Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Scott Foundas Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

TWITTER A bloody tense and generic return of the lets-assault-America action genre starring Gerard Butler and directed by Antoine Fuqua. In a week when North Korea posted a homemade video showing the U.S. Capitol building being destroyed by a missile what more logical response could Hollywood offer than a macho thriller about a Secret Service agent who takes on North Korean terrorists who attack the White House? The first of two similarly themed action dramas set for this year (White House Down arrives in June) Olympus Has Fallen will put to the test the question of whether American audiences are ready 12 years after 9/11 to watch strictly as disposable popcorn entertainment a film in which the United States and some of its most prominent landmarks are devastated by foreign terrorists. The answer almost undoubtedly will be yes as the tough-guy former agent played by Gerard Butler gets to kick a whole lot of badass butt while trying to rescue the president. Although this is the sort of film in which the fate of the world hinges when all is said and done on the outcome of a one-on-one martial arts contest director Antoine Fuquas notably bloody child of Die Hard still generates a fair amount of tension and produces the kind of nationalistic outrage that rock-ribbed Americans will feel in their guts. Foreign revenue should be hefty as well especially in countries where many viewers will get a thrill watching Washington get the sort of treatment usually reserved for places like Baghdad and Kabul. STORY Gerard Butler on Sacrificing His Life Declining the 300 Sequel and His ... Bar Mitzvah Either due to incredible clairvoyance on the parts of first-time screenwriters Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt or just through one of those twists of fate the film arrives just as North Korea has anti-U.S. saber-rattling an almost daily exercise. So it seems uncannily timely that the brilliant bad guy here is a (supposedly) rogue North Korean who leads a bunch of skilled commandos on a raid of the White House that nets them the president and several key members of his staff as hostages. No doubt bootleg copies of the film will make their way to Kim Jong-un who might be simultaneously offended and delighted at the opportunity to further rouse his subjects by showing them how much the enemy hates them. At its core however Olympus is like an 80s or 90s genre item in which Clint Eastwood Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson outwitted and outmuscled shrewd more formidably armed opponents. Like Eastwood in In the Line of Fire Butler (who also produced) plays a disgraced presidential agent sidelined and haunted by a fluky failure (detailed in a 10-minute prologue) who suddenly and inadvertently finds himself back in the thick of a crisis. If seemingly far-fetched the attack by the North Korean paramilitary team is nonetheless ingenious and pulled off with somewhat disturbing ease given that the White House is described as the best-fortified location on Earth. Its also quite violently staged. While President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) receives the South Korean premier and his entourage a C-130 comes roaring in very low over Virginia and D.C. Knocking out two Air Force fighter jets the terrorist-piloted plane heads down the mall and over toward the White House strafing civilians while a second wave of gunmen launch a ground attack on the presidential mansion. STORY Antoine Fuqua on Dennis Rodmans North Korea Trip Violence in Movies and His Eminem Film Inside the premiers alleged head of security shows his true colors as the plots mastermind. Kang (Rick Yune) quickly displays the diabolical genius worthy of any Bond villain (which Yune once played as another North Korean in Die Another Day). He rounds up the president Secretary of Defense (Melissa Leo in an enjoyably fierce performance) and a bunch of other top officials and takes them down to the White Houses massively secured emergency underground bunker where he tortures and kills some of his hostages and dictates terms the keys being the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from near the Korean demilitarized zone and the removal of the Navys 7th Fleet from the area. Enter Mike Banning (Butler) who knows the White House inside and out due to his years serving not only the president but entertaining his young son Connor (Finley Jacobsen) whos somewhere in the building and whom Kang wants as the ultimate bargaining chip. The bulk of the film thus becomes an elaborate cat-and-mouse game between Banning who against great odds taunts Kang and gradually reduces his minions numbers in several ambushes and one-on-one struggles and the North Korean megalomaniac who begins extracting the secret codes that will allow him to control the American nuclear arsenal. Meanwhile stuck with sedentary roles as officials sweating it out at the Pentagon heavily linked by video phones and computers are among many others Speaker of the House (and acting President) Trumbull (Morgan Freeman); Secret Service director Jacobs (Angela Bassett); and Gen. Clegg (Robert Forster) the gung-ho head of the Joint Chiefs. STORY Melissa Leo Im Not the Prettiest Actor Around but I Protect My Characters The ordeal is an all-night affair and unfortunately much of the White House action plays out in a murky muddy darkness that has a very washed-out look; cinematographer Conrad W. Hall could have taken a tip or two from the incredible nocturnal low-light-level work his father Conrad L. Hall did two decades ago in Jennifer Eight. Quite a bit of the action is obscured as a result. To his credit though Fuqua sustains the suspense until near the end of two hours; only in the final confrontation between Banning and Kang does the face-off seem over-extended and borderline risible. Willing to go for an R rating when a more inclusive one might have increased box office the filmmakers deliver some pretty tough and brutal scenes not the least of which has Kang mercilessly kicking and beating Leos defiant Secretary of Defense. After a string of increasingly lame and embarrassing projects Butler took charge on this one as a producer here in a role carefully crafted in a time-honored action-hero mold. He comes off pretty well as a sort of junior-league Mel Gibson with a bit less of the fiery-eyed craziness and wacky humor but plenty of grit and no shortage of appeal. In one-dimensional generic roles most of the other performers deliver as expected though Yunes exceptional looks and air of piercing intelligence pretty much maxes out what anyone could do with this sort of laser-focused villain figure. The extensive CGI work is variable -- pretty good where it counts most but sketchy around the edges. Trevor Morris wallpapers the action with a constantly churning score.
