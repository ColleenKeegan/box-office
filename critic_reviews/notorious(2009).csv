Like the Eminem and 50 Cent movies before it Notorious tells of a fatherless ghetto child seduced into the thug life who achieves financial and personal salvation through music. And while George Tillman Jrs film never tries to sugar coat the truth of Biggie Smallss short life his inability to find a new angle on this timeworn tale leaves the film feeling stale and pedestrian.Notorious is co-produced by Smallss mother Voletta Wallace with exec producer Sean P Diddy Combs looming large over proceedings. Whats surprising is how willing they are to showcase the darker side of Biggies personality hes a womaniser willing to sell crack to a pregnant woman ignore his children and attack his wife. An unconvincing third act redemption aside this is a warts-and-all portrait.But in every other aspect Notorious is exactly the film its pedigree would suggest. It checks off all the gangsta rap boxes first street battle first arrest first live show. Its directed in drab fashion and its characters are left unexplored Voletta is the archetypal long-suffering saint with Diddy as the reliable businessman keeping his charge on an even keel. And when it comes to the issue of commerce the filmmakers try to have their cake and eat it filling the screen with an orgy of hot cars and free-flowing Moet while still attempting to convince their audience that money aint everything.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Quiet Riot In Silent Light director Carlos Reygadas takes his sweet time with a cheating Mennonite. By David Edelstein Published Jan 11 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Palisades Tartan) In the hushed Mennonite adultery drama Silent Light the shots drag on and on and the nonactors internalize everything. The Mexican director Carlos Reygadas is attempting to induce a state of transcendence and his approach sometimes works because whats onscreen is so ponderously strange and because you have to surrender to the movie to keep from going buggy. Reygadas is an art-house hot dog a festival darling and a brutealthough this film is Brief Encounter compared to his last film Battle in Heaven which opened with an expressionless fat man being fellated in grisly close-up. Here the director keeps you at arms length for so long that when the characters finally express themselves (maybe an hour and 45 minutes in) the impact is thunderous. See pious plain stoic Mennonites emote. After a prologue in which the sun takes its time coming up and you try to slow your biorhythms Reygadas cuts to a North Mexican farmhouse where a large German-speaking Mennonite family eats a silent breakfast. Well its not precisely silent. The clock is ticking loudly. And from outside come barbaric noisesroosters banshee cries cows that bellow as if bats are chewing on their flesh. Its Night of the Living Dead out there. The father Johan (Cornelio Wall Fehr) is sunk in himself the mother Esther (Miriam Toews) stricken. Esther Im going to pick up the crankshaft. Johan were going out too. Johan remains at the table and then drives a ways to pick up the crankshaft. There is a long shot through his windshield. (Can there be a moratorium in art movies on windshield shots?) He confesses to a friend that hes seeing another Mennonite woman and the friend offers a surprising view Johans obsession he says might be founded in something sacred even if we dont understand it. Buoyed Johan drives in circles listening to what sounds like a polka; then suddenly hes standing on a hilltop gazing rapturously into the eyes of Marianne (Maria Pankratz) the wind lifting her hair and the sunlight dappling the camera lens. This is all rather studied but Reygadas follows it with an earthy yet radiant scene in which Johan is back with his family bathing in a creek A little blonde girl dangles her legs and flashes the camera a look of enchantment; Johan shampoos another daughters hair while Esther massages her feet with rapt concentration. This is the antithesis of that so-called sacred adultery the rough holiness of family life. When the washing stops (Come Esther lets go swim) the camera stays put the background blurred until a pink flower slowly comes into focus. The Times Manohla Dargis loved that shot for its metaphoric resonance; I felt a metaphoric allergy to metaphors coming on. But its hard to dismiss Reygadas entirely. At times his images suggest a tension between the hard but ephemeral physical world and the eternal spirit. Esther tells Johan that robbed of his love she no longer feels a part of the physical world and she staggers into a chilly downpour and sobs from her depths. Her fragile body is crumbling before his eyes. What has Johan done to this good loyal wife and mother? The helplessness rips you apart. If my judgment of Silent Light wavers its because I dont think Reygadas is inside his material. The bogusness of that blurry blossom haunts me Faces are masks metaphors upstage people. Johan is a big babyhe doesnt grow he has no stature. Marianne turns out to be more symbol than woman. The finale is a crowd-pleaser but its shameless like Tinkerbell dropping into a Lars von Trier picture. This director is too calculating to hold our trust for long and skepticism will kill transcendence every time. Christopher Wallace (Jamal Woolard) a.k.a. the rapper Notorious B.I.G. narrates the juicy revved-up semi-satisfying biopic Notorious even though hes murdered in the first sequence and the rest of the film is a flashback. The device is not ironic as in Sunset Boulevard; its meant to bring home the movies thesis that Wallace had acquired a mature perspective on his lifethat he had grown up at the instant he was cut down. This sentimental view somewhat diminishes Wallaces music which however profane was pretty sophisticated from the get-go vividly transmuting his experiences on the brutal streets of early-nineties Bed-Stuy into artand an original archetype. Somewhere Fats Waller was cackling. Woolard a Brooklyn rapper in his acting debut is a teddy bear but his performances have an authentic drive. Even if we miss the thinking that went into the creation of Wallaces B.I.G.-ger-than-life alter ego the movies performances are exultant. Directed by George Tillman Jr. from a script by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker Notorious is as upbeat as a movie that opens with its hero getting shot in the head could possibly be. We see the young Wallace dealing crack and narrowly avoiding a long prison stint. We see his inattentiveness as a father and his unfaithfulness to his wife Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) with Lil Kim (an irresistibly pert Naturi Naughton). But he was getting better really. Wallace as a boy is played by Biggies dead-ringer son Christopher Jordan Wallace (an infant when the rapper was killed) so we know his line lives on. His producer Sean Puffy Combs (Derek Luke) is a fount of positivity. (The real Combs is the films executive producer.) The vicious rivalry between the East Coast and West Coast rappers is here a misunderstanding exacerbated by the media with Biggie the bewildered recipient of Tupac Shakurs (Anthony Mackie) paranoia. The lack of tawdry gangsta melodrama is refreshing but it makes the ensuing homicides inexplicable Why would such positive young musicians want to kill one another? In Good the latest Nazi-centered morality play (the well is running dry folks) Viggo Mortensen does a fine fuddled turn as a German literature professor whose novel making an emotional case for euthanasia is heartily embraced by the Third Reich. Does he reject the power bestowed on him by a regime he abhors and that threatens his Jewish best friend (Jason Isaacs)? Or does he thrill his pretty new wife (Jodie Whittaker) and don a crisp SS uniform? Based on C. P. Taylors play Good is about the folly of trying to play it both ways. As a film its overly tidy and the surreal concentration-camp climax gave at least one viewer an inappropriate fit of giggles. But the subjectself-deception and failure of nerve in an unjust worldis too messy and horrible to laugh away. Silent Light Directed by Carlos Reygadas. Palisades Tartan. NR.

By David Denby Share Tweet Table of Contents Jamal Woolard as the late Biggie Smalls a.k.a. the Notorious B.I.G. Credit Illustration by Istvan Banyai Christopher Wallace who became known as the rapper Biggie Smalls or the Notorious B.I.G. was born in 1972 and was brought up in Bedford-Stuyvesant by his mother Voletta Wallace a middle-class woman from Jamaica. When Chris dropped out of school at the age of seventeen and became a crack dealer it was not for lack of love or support; Voletta a teacher who eventually earned a masters degree in education adored him. In the next few years Wallace was in and out of jail and he carried a gun at times. An inveterate scribbler he had written down rhymes since he was a boy and he made some tapes that came to the attention of the rap entrepreneur Sean (Puffy) Combs who helped him shape his material and brought out his first album ""Ready to Die"" in 1994. Organically conceived with a narrative line chronicling Biggies youth and his life on the streets the album announced his belief that a violent death would be his inevitable fate. Biggie boasted and taunted his way through songs with a masterly control of rhythm internal rhyme metaphor and story. After the album was released he became embroiled in the wars between East Coast and West Coast rappers and in 1997 following a party in Los Angeles he was shot and killed. He was twenty-four years old; his second album ""Life After Death"" came out two weeks after he died. Was Chris Wallace a nice middle-class boy who put himself in danger because he sensed that in order to become a rap artist he needed to pack the street into his resume? ""If you was a nice ordinary kid you was an easy mark for the wannabe gangsters"" he says at the beginning of the new biopic ""Notorious""--meaning that he had no choice but to be a tough. Still the authenticity issue lingers around hip-hop which is a cunningly crafted show-business phenomenon as well as an expression of urban culture. What I wanted from the movie was some clarity about Biggie Smallss motives and a sense of how much of him was created and how much was genuine. What I got was both conventional and confused--an uneasy mixture of biographical snapshots and ham-handed moralism arrayed in a dual narrative track in which Biggie (Jamal Woolard) haplessly slides toward death as he slowly and with many steps backward rises spiritually toward manhood. Written by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker and directed by George Tillman Jr. the movie teaches various lessons without saying anything coherent or illuminating. The man who wrote songs with such titles as ""Me and My Bitch"" and lyrics like ""Niggaz on the corner / I aint forget you niggaz / My triple beam niggaz word up"" is shown listening to Richard Pryor on TV as he says that ""nigger"" should be dropped from the language. How are we supposed to take that? As a rebuke to Biggie? As his true opinion? And shortly before Biggie dies he instructs his little daughter never to allow any man to call her ""bitch."" Is he simply contradicting himself? Is he a hypocrite? Did he have regrets? Or are the filmmakers attempting to clean him up for posterity? Voletta Wallace is a co-producer of the film (as are Biggies managers and Sean Combs is the executive producer) and as the movie tells it Biggie at twenty-four is on the verge of becoming the honorable son she always wanted him to be. Whether this is true or not Im pretty sure that its not a good idea for an artists mother to control any part of his biography. No doubt Mme. Rimbaud given the chance would have preferred to have her disreputable Arthur come out looking like a precocious Catholic schoolboy who only briefly dabbled in absinthe. In the movie Voletta (the sternly upright Angela Bassett) is a saint with a powerful tongue and Sean Combs (Derek Luke) is an artistic and commercial genius with infallible taste and judgment. The movie leaves us with the sense that twelve years after Biggie Smallss death a lot of people are trying to extract whatever profit or pride they can from the chaotic life of a young man who was as he well knew a work in progress. When swagger is what youre selling swagger may have to be manufactured though what counts in the end is the work itself whatever experience is behind it. As Biggie the heavyset rapper Jamal Woolard comes off to my eyes as a man with a gentler face and temper than the original but when Woolard sings changing his flow to match Biggies hes both powerful and persuasive. The songs still have a coruscating insistence and I would have liked to learn more about the professional details--how Biggie wrote the songs how much rehearsal and how many retakes were needed to get the music into its final form. The movie jumps restlessly from one flimsily established turning point to the next Biggie breaking promises to one woman after another (including his mother); Biggie making friends with the brilliant erratic West Coast rapper Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie) and then reacting with bewilderment when Shakur turns on him. George Tillman not only jumps around restlessly in Biggies life; he leaps in vintage MTV style from angle to angle within a given scene and the moods never settle in--we never understand why Biggie makes the decisions he does. In the end he seems trapped not so much in a fated existence as in a poorly organized biopic. Maybe a life this tumultuous cant be jammed into a two-hour movie. A miniseries may be the dramatic form that would make Biggie Smalls a convincing man though the songs as a brief searing outburst probably provide the strongest sense of him that we will ever get. So much of cinema is given over to rapid movement frenzy and abrupt montage that its easy to forget that the medium also has a fluent way with stillness and silence--the long hard stare of the camera which isolates and celebrates the essence of something. Both Doris Dorries ""Cherry Blossoms"" a strangely poetic evocation of the cycles of grief and renewal and Kelly Reichardts ""Wendy and Lucy"" a mournful tribute to a young female drifter (Michelle Williams) are filled with landscapes buildings faces things many of them examined with a rapt attention that releases us from the fast-moving dazzle that is now so commonly (and exhaustingly) familiar. The German writer-director Dorrie whose film ""Men"" was a hit here in 1986 starts with a seemingly stolid retired middle-aged couple in Bavaria Trudi (Hannelore Elsner) and Rudi (Elmar Wepper) who travel around to vacation spots without much purpose. Their grown children two of whom they visit in Berlin are still obsessed with separating themselves from their parents and the visit produces irritation and selfish indifference even embarrassment. It certainly never occurs to the children that Mom and Dad have inner lives. But it turns out that Trudi as a young woman was fascinated by Butoh an amalgam of German Expressionism and Japanese avant-garde dance techniques. Performed in white makeup Butoh expresses states of transition--taut hands revolving and thrusting and a sudden crumpling torso appear to invite death and then to repel it. When Trudi dies the grief-stricken Rudi goes to Tokyo to visit their third child a lonely young man who had moved far away to escape his dependence on his mother and he quickly falls in with a young woman whom he sees performing Butoh alongside a canal. Shes mourning the death of her own mother and together they make a pilgrimage to Mt. Fuji which becomes an appropriate setting for the improbable transformation of a middle-aged gut-heavy Bavarian into a dancer enacting his grief. The movies conceits are just barely endurable but the sharpness of Dorries eye--for Tokyos electric night for Fujis iconographic landscapes for cherry blossoms--sustains emotion even when story logic fails. Michelle Williamss drifter Wendy stuck in Oregon is neither crazy nor criminal but she has less sense than a quiet creature in the woods. She merely exists harmless but obdurate a slight wandering woman without a discernible past whose only allegiance is to her yellow-brown mutt Lucy. The movie has been called an early portent of recession-era blues but its hard to see what work Wendy could do even in boom times. She has an idea of finding a job in Alaska but its so vague that it seems more a dream than a plan. The society that she lives in is as indifferent to her as she is to it--some people help her others brush her off and she never connects with anyone but an elderly security guard. Shes infuriating but the movie for all its morose impassivity is beautiful and haunting. As Williams plays her Wendy is full of feeling and as skinny as she is she has a palpable fleshy presence. Kelly Reichardt seems to be saying ""Yes she merely exists--isnt that enough?"" She wont go away and Reichardt immerses her in Oregons summer light its forests as seen from a moving train. The cinematography is so tactile that even a run-down building stirs us with its purchase on its given space in the world. A contemplative movie like this clears all the whirling meaningless imagery out of our heads.  Share Tweet David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

It looks good and facets of it shine but behind the gilded facade theres not much there. And what is there can be troubling and retrogressive. INTERVIEW Jamal Woolard has B.I.G. shoes to fill TRAILER Take a look at Notorious The film starts with the mysterious -- and still unsolved -- 1997 murder of rapper Christopher Wallace better known as Biggie Smalls or Notorious B.I.G. The film lionizes Biggie attempting to depict a cheater and drug dealer -- he even sells crack to a pregnant woman -- as a martyr. Most noteworthy is the movies stunning cinematography and powerful soundtrack. Notorious posits that Biggie was obsessed with acting like a man which could explain his behavior. It tries to rationalize Biggies choices in a simplistic way He grew up without a father. As an excuse for selling drugs toting guns and abusing women however it seems too pat. The film implies that Biggie was on the brink of maturity when he was gunned down at 24. That may be but this feels like a cinematic device rather than a convincing look at the artist. The ensemble is solid and Jamal Woolard is strong and credible as Biggie. Ones attention never lags as the biopic progresses from his childhood through adolescence in Brooklyn to a prison stint and then on to wealth and fame. Woolard performing Biggies raps are among the films most compelling scenes. Biggie is played from ages 8-13 by his son Christopher Jordan Wallace. His devoted mother Voletta (Angela Bassett) tempers her affection with a heavy dose of tough love. Another critical relationship is between Biggie and Sean Combs (Derek Luke). The film also chronicles Biggies tempestuous pairings with singers Lil Kim (Naturi Naughton) and Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) and his soured friendship with Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie). While Notorious is well-made it mythologizes someone who treated people particularly women with disrespect and whose life and art glamorized drug use promiscuity and violence. It seems an odd choice of film to open just days before the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

At major theatres. 18A This movie about hip-hop icon Christopher Wallace lifts its title from its subjects primary stage name. Yet one of the Notorious B.I.G.s posthumous hits mightve been more appropriate ""Mo Money Mo Problems."" Despite the movies many images of Cristal-fueled decadence Notorious offers an unusually dispiriting take on success. That wasnt the case with 8 Mile and Get Rich or Die Tryin two earlier movies that traced the origin myths of hip-hop stars albeit with subjects (Eminem and 50 Cent) who were still alive to play themselves when the cameras rolled.But Notorious is less concerned with the rise of a promising upstart than the stresses and dangers that come with being on top. Article Continued BelowAs such the movie has some bite and plenty of energy even if many aspects of Wallaces life and music are excised or simplified in the process of making the big story of this very big man fit the mould of the Hollywood biopic.Indeed the abundance of blunts and Glocks on screen doesnt disguise Notorious close kinship with Ray and Walk the Line. It too arranges an unruly and sometimes contradiction-filled life into a much more orderly series of predictable story beats.The film opens with Wallaces murder in L.A. in 1997 and then flashes back to his childhood in Brooklyn. Though his mother Voletta (Angela Bassett) does all she can to keep him off the streets her little ""Chrissy-Poo"" is soon led astray. Wallaces career as a drug dealer is curtailed when his potential as an MC becomes clear. His pal D-Roc (Dennis L.A. White) even takes the fall for a gun possession charge to save Wallace from a lengthy prison stint saying that if someone like him can make it in the rap game ""we all make it.""Wallace also finds key supporters in ambitious music exec Sean ""Puffy"" Combs (Derek Luke) and fellow rapper Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie). Knowledge of the ill will to come casts a shadow over scenes featuring the two MCs in happier days long before the bicoastal feud that would poison their careers and culminate in the violent deaths of both men.The portrayal of Wallaces equally volatile love life takes up nearly as much screen time as the beef with Tupac and his West Coast cronies. Wallaces rocky relationships with Lil Kim (Naturi Naughton) and Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) provide plenty of opportunities for what Puffy disparagingly calls ""soap opera drama."" In playing Wallace Jamal Woolard is successful at conveying his off-stage charm less so at duplicating his onstage menace and intensity. In this respect Notorious falls into a typical trap for biopics about performers as the tawdriest details of Wallaces private life take precedence over displays of the talent that made him famous in the first place. Had the opposite been true Notorious would have come closer to taking the full measure of the man. As it is this tale of triumph and tragedy within hip hops elite is intelligent gripping and far less sensationalistic than anyone could have expected.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Directed by George Tillman Jr. Starring Jamal Woolard Derek Luke Angela Bassett. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It must have been an act of great restraint for Sean Combs to resist titling this film about Chris Wallace his close friend turned rapper and cultural icon ""The Notorious B.I.G. - The Sean Combs Story."" If there is one take-away from this fawning bio-pic which Combs executive produced its that Sean ""Puffy/Puff Daddy/P.Diddy/Diddy"" Combs is a visionary who played a critical role at every point in Wallaces brief career. Combs discovered the Brooklyn teenager and gave him the option of slinging crack in the streets or slinging raps in the studio. Combs of course was also the lone believer in Wallaces talent and it was Combs - despite the cackles of Wallaces gangsta posse - who suggested Wallace record what would become his soft-tempo anthem ""Juicy."" It was Combs - wouldnt you know - who guided Wallace with life-changing platitudes (""You cant change the world until you change yourself""); it was Combs who gave Wallace the backbone to perform onstage in Los Angeles despite rival Death Row Records crew members lurking in the audience; and it Combs who cradled Wallace in his arms on the way to the hospital after the rapper was shot down in Los Angeles in March 1997. And it was Combs - oh yes we could do this all day - who in an otherwise moving funeral scene leaned over to mother Voletta Wallace (played by a superb Angela Bassett) and offered to do ""anything - anything at all"" which leads to Wallaces triumphant casket ride through the streets of Bed-Stuy. The problem with this telling of Wallaces life is that while the filmmakers are busy making a vanity project they forget to show why Wallace was such a unique talent and in what cultural context his raps flourished. Some concert scenes suggest the filmmakers were concerned about whether this would be a film you could dance to which it certainly is. Its also a perfectly serviceable rise-and-fall gangster flick with all the sepia tone one could hope for. But it mostly makes a strong case for third-party detachment in story-telling. Perhaps there should be a new artistic commandment the 15-5 rule If you want to portray a rapper or artist on the big screen youve got to wait 15 years from the subjects death and live at least five degrees of separation from the subject. Itll help limit the hagiography. In ""Notorious"" Combs Voletta Wallace and two of Wallaces former managers serve as producers. Wallaces real-life son plays his father as a nerdy schoolboy. While one scene shows Wallaces violence against wife Faith Evans (and no mention of his arrests for assault) Wallaces transgressions as a human being - selling crack to pregnant women; rampant infidelity; letting a friend take the fall for a weapons charge and a three-year prison stint in Wallaces name - are all meant to show us that while the Big Poppa had his flaws he was really just an irresistible lug among friends. (About the whole West Coast-East Coast rivalry thing According to this film it was a myth born from Tupac Shakurs paranoia then perpetuated by the media and angrily disavowed by both Combs and Wallace. Still its a real enough entity to serve as the prime suspect in Wallaces murder.) Wallace is played straight by first-timer Jamal Woolard a ringer who gets the mannerisms and nasal huffing correct while portraying the character as a big-time charmer in the deluxe. Wallace was an honor student with a playful wit but in his teens turned to drug dealing for nothing more than a sudden ""addiction to the paper."" Theres no sincere explanation for what drove such a good (and apparently doted on) kid to become an angry pistol-whipping thug whos relatively ruthless deep into his adulthood. In a scene meant to show Wallaces growth as a man just before his death the author of such songs as ""Me amp; My Bitch"" sits his young daughter on his lap and orders her to never let a man call her the b-word. Its a rich moment Did Wallace get to age 24 and father two children before he realized ""bitch"" was a disrespectful term? Or did the filmmakers have to add that scene to humanize their friend? Wallaces music surely meant something lasting to his fans. It did more than make people dance and it was more than an artful examination of ""life on the streets"" a theme well-mined by rappers long before him. Yet Combs fails to show what made his former employees rhymes speak to so many. ""My son told stories"" Voletta Wallaces character says in a voiceover. All rappers tell stories. But what was so special about Chris Wallaces other than they appeared on Combs record label? Advisory This film is loaded with profane language overwhelming amounts of self-grandiosity a couple of sex scenes some nudity and Lil Kims sexually explicit rapping.

"Movie review Notorious -- 4 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Notorious -- 4 out of 5 stars Jamal Woolard Fox Searchlight Jamal Woolard Jamal Woolard (Fox Searchlight) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Rap earns its first top-drawer bio film with Notorious a revealing moving and entertaining peek at the 24 years that Biggie Smalls aka Notorious B.I.G. spent on this Earth. George Tillman Jr.s film may follow the well-worn path of many a musical biography. But spot-on casting a light touch around the edges and affection for its subject makes this warts-and-all look at the big man with the big hits a winner.We meet Christopher Wallace when hes a grade-school nerd wearing a uniform getting the good grades that his mom (Angela Bassett regal as always) demands. But a smart kid with a passion for cash and the new hip hop of the streets figures out pretty quickly that good grades wont get him where he wants to go. The fact that the Biggies real son Christopher Jordan Wallace plays the boy Christopher lends extra poignancy to these scenes. The kid grows into a teen dope dealer an amoral greedy creep (Jamal Woolard)O who will sell crack to pregnant women lie to his mom his pregnant girlfriend and risk prison time anything for ""the cash."" He can rhyme sure. But his life doesnt change until he meets the charismatic inspiring Sean ""Puffy"" Combs.""Dont chase the money. Chase the dream"" preaches Combs played by Derek Luke with a charge of energy and a splash of stardust. And so ""Biggie"" is born. Tillman who directed the fine Men of Honor trips through the benchmarks of Biggies rise -- concerts studio sessions -- and his women. Naturi Naughton O gives a star-making performance as Lil Kim a Biggie discovery who rocked his bedroom (fun graphic sex scenes) and then became a star in her own right her sexy stage image molded by her rapper-lover. Antonique SmithO is terrific as Faith Evans Biggies wife.Notorious is framed within a flashback that takes place on the night in 1997 when Biggie was murdered. Tillman deftly takes us through the friendship with Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie dazzling) that degenerated into a paranoid feud that police have never been able to pinpoint as the cause for the murders of both stars.The script by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari CokerO captures more of Biggies personality than any of the many fine documentaries about Biggie Tupac and the rap of that era. This Biggie is funny brash confident a little less the mamas boy-poseur he appeared to be in such films as Rhyme and Reason and Biggie and Tupac.Credit for that has to go to Woolard a novice who just nails the mans swagger his tone and his style. The resemblance physically and vocally is uncanny. The films rare missteps have more to do with sins of omission -- details left out a little image burnishing for Biggie and Puffy (who produced the film). But Tillman has crafted a film biography that will stand as definitive with all the passion ambition and violence that this man and his era in rap came to represent.

Notorious. (R) Fox Searchlight (100 min.) Directed by George Tillman Jr. With Jamal Woolard Angela Bassett Derek Luke. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS. ""Notorious"" is the tale of a Brooklyn kid raised right but leaning wrong. He deals drugs does time makes a baby but keeps moving. Then he finally hooks up with a hungry rap impresario and starts recording the songs that have already won him the streets respect. Yes its the B.I.G. story. But its not big enough. Biggie Smalls the Notorious B.I.G. -- or just plain Christopher ""Chrissie-Pooh"" Wallace to his Moms -- was a chart-topping artist who had some enormous hits discovered Lil Kim feuded with Tupac Shakur and died in 1997 at 24 shot to death by an unknown assailant. But the film has no new insights into his music or answers about his mysterious death. (Nick Broomfields 2002 documentary ""Biggie and Tupac"" remains the go-to film there) And it fails to mount any serious re-evaluation of his life. The movie wants us to believe Wallace was a good kid who had to become a bad one to survive the Bed-Stuy streets a boy who had no idea of what it was to become a man but was finally learning before he was so prematurely cut down. But the facts arent in evidence. Instead the film shows us a kid who deals drugs because he wants nice sneakers and gold chains. And considering his longtime violence and irresponsibility the signs of his last-minute conversion -- polite calls to his various exes a sudden interest in his far-flung kids -- dont convince. Its producers however are already sold. Thats because they include Wallaces devoted mother two former managers and mentor Sean Combs -- people who all presumably loved Wallace and undoubtedly continue to profit from his work. Not surprisingly they and he all come off well in this authorized biography. But perspective? Thats missing from the screen as is any sort of interesting approach. (Just one might have briefly explored why so many strutting bad-boy rappers -- and the Notorious B.I.G. Ice-T and Puff Daddy are just a few -- began as Catholic schoolboys and/or respectful sons. Was the adult persona purely a pose? Or a full-on rebellion?) There are some fine performances. Jamal Woolard -- himself a controversial Brooklyn artist -- captures Wallaces deep voice and imperial style. And the marvelous Angela Bassett is fierce as Wallaces strict and loving mother (although she can never decide whether to use a Jamaican accent). As for the many many women in Wallaces life -- there was quite obviously a lot to love -- Jersey girls Antonique Smith and Naturi Naughton are almost as surprisingly soulful as the real Faith Evans and unstoppably nasty (and frequently unclothed) as the genuine Lil Kim. Yet the script lets too much slide and director George Tillman Jr. -- whose biggest films have been ""Soul Food"" and the ""Barbershop"" franchise -- abets it. A harder edge would have helped. (Spike Lee is the obvious but probably absolutely wrong choice given how he feels about gangsta style.) There are some good jokes in the film (""What kind of grown-ass man calls himself Puffy"" Wallaces mother asks) and Anthony Mackie is eye-catching as the charismatic Tupac. But Wallace himself just comes off as selfish impulsive and manipulating. Who even now more than 10 years after his death is still getting people to do exactly what he wants. Rating note The film contains continuous profanity nudity violence and sexual situations. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

BANG By Kyle Smith View author archive email the author follow on twitter Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) January 16 2009 | 500am MUCH closer to Scorsese than ""Scarface"" ""Notorious"" gives a heartfelt yet clear-eyed sendoff to the late Brooklyn rapper Christopher Wallace a k a Biggie Smalls a k a the Notorious B.I.G. Filmed with its feet planted in the broken glass of Fulton Street and without ignoring Biggies abusive relationships with women or his drug dealing (even in one scene to a pregnant woman) the movie nevertheless discovers in Biggie a soul to match his 300-pound body. Pop Video Quiz Hip Hop Legends MORE Biggie Movie May Actually Become Notorious Biggie is vividly portrayed by newcomer Jamal Woolard - another Brooklyn hip-hop artist who under the name Gravy was himself shot in an attack outside Hot 97s studio in 2006 then went on the air and performed anyway. Woolard is blustering frightening funny and real - more at ease in his street clothes than in the affected 30s mobster bling that Biggie wore once he got paid. And even when angrily hurling money at a booing crowd or slapping his women around he never leaves behind the little boy Biggies Jamaican mom (Angela Bassett) always saw in him. Hes surrounded by an able cast that includes Derek Luke as Puffy Combs and Anthony Mackie as Tupac Shakur the onetime friend whose rivalry with Biggie is still the subject of fierce debate. According to this movie Biggie was as shocked as Shakur when the latter was shot while leaving a recording session in midtown. Shakur who survived that ambush but not the next one is seen blaming Biggie for setting him up a charge that grew into a blood feud between hip-hoppers from New York and L.A. Biggie arises with a fury out of ""do-or-die Bed-Stuy"" where he tries to keep his crack dealing a secret to his mom who thinks her son keeps ""plates of mashed potatoes"" under his bed. After filling notebooks with his rhymes in prison he emerges an admired rapper ""Your s - - t got nice"" says a friend. Why not lay down some tracks? After all ""I know mother - - - - ers who know mother - - - - ers."" The language of ""Notorious"" is aggressively rude yet director George Tillman Jr. (""Barbershop"") handles it with the same mix of amazement and amusement that characterizes Martin Scorsese films. The dialogue is almost like a rap with lines like (from Puffy) ""My business is about the streets but it aint in the streets"" and (Biggies reply) ""If you got real paper comin my way Im out the game."" Combs is a fuzzy presence here a generic impresario making magical promises. He wanders in and out without ever coming into focus which is a shame because this Westchester-reared tightrope walker is at least as interesting as the title character. Faith Evans Biggies wife asks her man ""Are you a bad guy trying to be good or a good guy trying to be bad?"" The differences between Biggie and Puffy on this point could have made for more interesting scenes than the many featuring Biggies fights with Faith and his girlfriend Lil Kim (forcefully played in her film debut by Naturi Naughton who has just landed a lead role in the remake of ""Fame""). ""Notorious"" kicks it up in the final act though as the rivalry with Shakur grows eerie and the world closes in on Biggie the way it did on Henry Hill in the climactic scenes of ""Goodfellas."" Unlike Hill Biggie is trying to reset his life getting the 23rd Psalm tattooed on his forearm (""Moms gonna love this"") and reliving frustrating mistakes - some his some seemingly polluting the air he breathes. In a flashback to his sons birth a friend calls the boy a ""n - - - er."" Biggie plaintively asks ""Cant this mother - - - - er be in this world one week without being called n - - - er?"" His moms verdict was that he finally became a man. Biggie if he was being honest would have claimed only that he tried. As he puts it in the film ""A motherf - - - ers a work in progress you know what Im sayin?"" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next LIPSTICK JUNGLE NOT CANCELLED Read Next LIPSTICK JUNGLE NOT CANCELLED Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 41610 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20838 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 19219 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(20th Century Fox) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 15 2009 628 PM Was Christopher (Biggie) Wallace really the vulnerable overgrown adolescent we see in ""Notorious""? Was Faith Evans such a devoutly loyal wife and Sean (Puffy) Combs so solidly dedicated to his young discovery? Only they know for sure. But chances are thats how it will be cemented in history since its unlikely there will be a better dramatization of the Biggie Smalls story than this one.Wisely skirting conspiracies and controversy George Tillman Jr.s straightforward biopic was produced by Combs and Biggies mom Voletta Wallace with cooperation from Evans among others. As a result all three come across as practically saintly. But despite the lack of objectivity - a feeling enhanced by the occasionally overawed script - Tillman weaves his familiar strands into a fascinating tale. Then again since we know these characters already its the players in front of the camera who matter most. And no one had more pressure on him to succeed than Jamal Woolard better known as Gravy a rapper rumored to have staged his own shooting to boost his reputation. If thats actually true he could have saved himself a bullet and gone straight into acting. Making a cant-take-your-eyes-off-him debut as Biggie Woolard knows he has enormous shoes to fill and he never once disappoints. First though Christopher Jordan Wallace plays his father in the early scenes as a quiet insecure kid. Single mom Voletta (Angela Bassett) is her sons staunchest supporter but even she cant keep him from the streets. After years of being picked on for his weight he decides to get tough and begins selling drugs in his Bed-Stuy neighborhood. Eventually his rhymes earn him some attention and he winds up working with Combs (Derek Luke). Things are great for a while the newly notorious B.I.G. becomes a superstar marries Evans (Antonique Smith) and keeps his protege Lil Kim (Naturi Naughton) as a girlfriend. But as we know the growing feud between East Coast and West Coast artists - including Smalls former friend Tupac (Anthony Mackie) - will eventually end in tragedy. Lil Kim has publicly complained that she wasnt consulted but Naughton offers a nuanced portrait of her larger-than-life character as does each member of the unusually outstanding cast. And though Tillman never quite gets to the heart of Biggies motivations it may be that no one did - not even the friends who were involved in the making of the movie. Layering his film with the songs that made his subject an icon Tillman is aware that Biggie connected with his audience because he told stories others instantly understood. ""Notorious"" does that too.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

He boasted an effortless touch behind the microphone -- but always got his point across. That same quality propels Notorious a vivid biopic of the larger-than-life rap star that doesnt require you be a big fan of the genre. George Tillman Jr.s (Soul Food Men of Honor) unintrusive direction allows the story to find its natural groove and the film benefits from inspired casting and ace performances. Reggie Rock Bythewoods and Cheo Hodari Cokers script careens through several aspects of Biggies life. But it always comes back to the music. We see a grade-school Christopher ""Biggie"" Wallace (played by the late rappers own son a sweet touch) lose himself amid the hip-hop sounds inside a boom box. A teenage Wallace handily beats a rival during an MC battle. And a few years later he meets up with Sean ""Puffy"" Combs (Derek Luke) who encourages his friend to take his street rhymes to a more mainstream audience. They eventually turn the genre toward a more melody-based sound reliant on old-school samples in some of the films most engaging sequences. Wallace was shot and killed in March 1997 after leaving a party and despite numerous lawsuits and court cases no arrests were ever made. It would be easy then to posthumously paint the performer as somewhat of a saint. But the script doesnt shy away from Wallaces shortcomings. He began dealing drugs at a young age did jail time had a sometimes-volatile temper and wasnt a picture-perfect husband and father. As the titular character Jamal Woolard expertly drives that point home. Bringing such an iconic modern figure (back) to life is a heady task but Woolard nails Wallaces musical and emotional complexities. That Woolard is a first-time actor (and fledgling rapper) makes it all the more impressive. Woolards doughy face and soulful eyes give his performance added layers of emotion. He captures some nice subtleties both in the dramatic scenes and performance pieces. And he plays things light when needed especially in spry scenes with his female co-stars. Angela Bassetts role as steely mom Voletta who survived a bout with breast cancer could have veered into thankless territory. But Bassett is such a good actress that the role crackles with energy. All the motherly fear and worry for a son read on her face in almost every scene. (Wallaces mother is a co-producer on the film.) Theres also good work among the actors playing Wallaces inner circle. Each player brings zip and color to these familiar characters. Luke doesnt bear great resemblance to Puffy but he captures the moguls jerky energy and dance moves. Anthony Mackie also conjures some of the late Tupac Shakurs mystique (though the filmmakers are vague on exactly how his friendship with Wallace soured). Antonique Smith exudes steely grace and charm as wife and singer Faith Evans; and Naturi Naughton infuses her portrayal of pint-size rapper Lil Kim (who has criticized the film) with fire and humanity. Notoriousultimately stresses that Wallace was a guy with a good heart a dreamer who didnt always do the right thing. In that respect its a life we can all relate to -- with or without the multi-platinum albums and rap swagger. joey.guerrachron.com Todays Deals Ryobi 31-Piece Drill and Drive Kit for 10 + pickup at Home Depot 5.11 Tactical Mens Twill Pants for 15 + free shipping NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Fruit of the Loom Mens Boxer Briefs 8-Pack for 12 + pickup...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In ""Notorious"" a drive-by shooting in L.A. leaves its 24-year-old narrator in flashback mode. Fans of rapper Chris ""Notorious B.I.G."" Wallace know that the big poppa from Brooklyns Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood died that night in 1997. And this dead-man-talking riff carries ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""American Beauty"" promise. Too bad those possibilities arent put to better use by writers Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker. Instead ""Notorious"" directed by George Tillman Jr. with a sentimental touch seems torn. Should it plunge into the unreliable bravado of a man who (aided by producer Sean ""Puffy"" Combs) revitalized East Coast rap with his liquid grit? Or should it spin a tale -- more celebratory than cautionary -- of a creative force who was also father husband and son? Wavering between both ""Notorious"" winds up feeling at times like an apologia for bad choices and a dodge of the moral implications that come with telling a story about a young black man who decides to sling crack on the corner and never quite gives up his habit of lying to the women in his life. (Hurried third-act amends dont count.) Jamal Woolard a rapper himself impresses as Biggie even if he never fully convinces us of the portly street poets pull with the ladies among them volatile squeeze and protege ""Lil Kim"" Jones played with hostile need by Naturi Naughton. Wallaces mother Voletta was an engine in the making of this biography. So it shouldnt surprise that the movie needs to wrench hope from an altogether avoidable death. As Voletta Angela Bassett heads an ensemble with the muscle and agility for a richer undertaking. And Antonique Smiths turn as Ramp;B artist Faith Evans Wallaces wife goes farthest in providing a frustrated yet loving perspective on Wallace. ""Notorious"" comes with its share of jailhouse epiphanies and outlaw montages. Biggie Puffy and friend-turned-foe rapper Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie) trade a few too many streetwise affirmations. ""Cant change the world if we cant change ourselves"" sounds good. Only its never fully put into practice. Sure unfulfilled promise is a moral -- but is it enough of one? And ""Notorious"" arrives in theaters at a potent moment. Tuesday the nation swears in its first black president. Yet few weeks ago a report was released citing disproportionately high stats on black-on-black juvenile male homicides.

This engrossing biopic throbbing with style and attitude will likely add to his legend. Produced by his mother Voletta Wallace (whos played by Angela Bassett) and his show business mentor Sean ""Puffy"" Combs (Derek Luke) the movie is frank about Biggie--the drug dealing jail time womanizing and angry outbursts--but emphasizes his humanity. In a memorable debut Jamal Woolard portrays Wallace as a well-bred student turned streetwise entrepreneur with unerring commercial instincts. Director George Tillman Jr. sidesteps speculation about Wallaces unsolved murder focusing instead on the way rap defined his generation.

(PHIL CARUSO) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / January 16 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Notorious"" gives the Hollywood superhero treatment to the rapper Notorious B.I.G. For hip-hop partisans watching Christopher Wallace become Biggie Smalls then the Notorious B.I.G. must be what its like for comic-book fans to see Tony Stark become Iron Man. Biggies hard-knock life and premature death (he was shot in 1997 at age 24) have been repackaged into an enjoyably ridiculous entertainment about a pursy young man with mysterious sex appeal who turns the rap world on its ear.Built around a relaxed but vibrant performance by the rapper and first-time actor Jamal Woolard ""Notorious"" is part melodrama part bullet-riddled cautionary tale all nostalgic trip back to the mid-1990s. I left the movie more desperate for a Coogi sweater than I ever was when it was appropriate to want one.""Notorious"" was produced by Biggies mother Voletta Wallace and Sean ""P Diddy"" Combs his close friend and producer which is to say its predictably protective of the rappers legacy. (Biggies son Christopher Jordan Wallace plays him in a few early scenes.) Excepting some dirty business with the California rapper and actor Tupac Shakur (more about that in a minute) the movies not a total whitewash either. It hits many of the high notes of Wallaces life and some sour ones too.Its true that Voletta Wallace has paid herself quite a compliment by having Angela Bassett play her in this movie but the relationship the film depicts between mother and son isnt simple. Even though Voletta a Jamaican immigrant gives him lots of love and a stable home in Fort Greene Brooklyn her son is drawn to the instant financial gratification of dealing drugs. (She thinks the white stash under his bed is mashed potatoes.) But mother evicts son and son eventually gets busted for possession and winds up in jail.He has a daughter with his high-school girlfriend (Julia Pace Mitchell) but his life doesnt really begin to turn around until he meets ""Puffy"" Combs a big-talking recording-industry upstart played as a dancing exclamation point by Derek Luke. (To see Luke in track suits and an S-Curl expertly re-create Combs shuffle-stutter dances and to hear him chronically over-inflect his words is to witness heavenly comedy.)Puffy is prone to offering Biggie ultimatums - ""the studio or the streets"" - and making dreams come true. (""By the time youre 21 Ill make you a millionaire"" he promises.) Combs didnt write the script - thats credited to Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker whos also written a book about the Notorious B.I.G. - but one imagines he had the opportunity to do some polishing.Not everyone who pops up in the film is so lucky. ""Notorious"" offers up a feisty young sales clerk named Kimberly Jones (Naturi Naughton) who after a few afternoon trysts with Biggie explodes into the lascivious rapper Lil Kim. The movie suggests that her signature look was Biggies idea (""Keep the suspenders lose the shirt"") and that installing her in his Junior M.A.F.I.A. collective only led to headaches since she was so viciously hung up on him. Things only get worse after he starts dating and marries a half-white singer named Faith Evans (Antonique Smith). ""Whats she got that I dont?"" cries Kim. Where to start blonder hair lighter skin decorum.Even with Faith monogamy doesnt come easy to Biggie if it comes at all. And the movie directed by George Tillman Jr. has a good time showing the blowups and meltdowns in the rappers relationships. Its all overblown and yet in these entanglements you get a nifty convergence of pop folklore - Ray Charless love life in Fatty Arbuckles body. Despite Bassetts steeliness few people come to a movie like ""Notorious"" for acting fireworks but some of the performances are strong especially Smiths. She finds the wounded warrior in Evans more dramatically than any of Evanss music.The films dramatic crux of course is Biggies relationship with Tupac whom a shameless Anthony Mackie plays as a kind of thrill-seeking nutcase. The Biggie in ""Notorious"" admires Tupac who is already a rap star while Biggies on the rise. But after a shooting in the lobby of a recording-studio building wounds Tupac the relationship is strained. ""Notorious"" suggests that a delusional and paranoid Tupac thought Biggie and Puffy set him up and never dropped his grudge. Biggie meanwhile has no idea what went wrong and sits home watching old footage of him and his buddy with tears in his eyes. (I said it wasnt a complete whitewash)While dropping some funny datelines (""The Source Awards"" ""The Soul Train Awards"") Tillman effectively captures the resulting East Coast-West Coast furor that culminated in Tupacs death in 1996 then Biggies six months later. The drama around these two men riveted the nation for over a year. This version of the relationship may even stoke new debate since it tells one side of two unsolved mysteries. Yet ""Notorious"" doesnt aspire to be a work of journalism. Nick Broomfields 2002 procedural documentary ""Biggie and Tupac"" boldly went down that road and turned up only more speculation.While Woolard doesnt try to fully imitate Biggies distinctive slurry sound he captures just enough of its essence. The revelation is how with a little crisper diction Woolard tips Biggies raps from the blues to rock n roll - theres fresh anger in this music. Otherwise ""Notorious"" is only loosely interested in Biggie as a creative artist. The movie stints on any psychological connection between Biggie and his songs instead using the rappers life to teach lessons and to offer its audience reassurances (the sky for instance is the limit).After 110 minutes of the ""n"" word being deployed with abandon Biggie vows to renounce it.

"Notorious | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; notorious ) Notorious (United States 2009) A movie review by James Berardinelli Last year when I heard about a film on the way called Notorious I was concerned that there would be an ""updating"" of Alfred Hitchcocks film of the same name. Thankfully this is not the case. Notorious is not an example of a remake but it is an example of a whitewash. A bio-pic of the influential 90s rapper Notorious B.I.G. a.ka. Biggie Smalls a.k.a. Christopher Wallace Notorious purports to provide an intimate perspective of the iconic figures life. Considering that his mother and close friend are listed among the co-producers and his son plays him as a child one can safely assume this does not present an unbiased account of the facts. The film directed by George Tillman Jr. effectively neuters any thuggishness in Biggies character leaving us with a protagonist who is essentially a good man guilty of having made some bad decisions. From a dramatic perspective this isnt necessarily a bad move. Theres no rule that decrees a bio-pic cant pick and choose from the facts - this isnt a documentary. Also it could be argued that fashioning a likeable Biggie is important to making the movie palatable. The question however is whether the filmmakers go too far. Although the movie acknowledges Biggies time as a drug-dealer and indicates that he carried guns was unfaithful and was occasionally complicit in less-than-savory incidents the character overall comes across as a little too clean to be believed (especially in the ""gangster rap"" context). And one of Biggies best buddies Sean ""Puffy"" Combs could be a candidate for sainthood based on whats on-screen Its no surprise then to see Combs listed as a producer. Questions about the legitimacy of the portrayal of Biggie aside the movies principal problem is one that afflicts many bio-pics the inability to effectively cram an entire life into two hours. Notorious which is narrated by a dead man starts in the early 1980s and ends on a March night in 1997 when a drive-by shooter puts four bullets into Biggies chest. (For those concerned that this constitutes a spoiler its the first scene in the movie.) This condensation of 15 years transforms the movie into the cinematic equivalent of a ""Greatest Hits"" album - we get lots of highlights but none of the smaller lesser known material. As a result Notorious often feels rushed and uneven. Relationships and events that deserve more screen time speed past providing audiences with a flavor but no lingering taste. Great bio-pics stay with audiences. This one while not unpleasant is forgettable. The movie begins in Brooklyn with young Christopher Wallace (Christopher Jordan Wallace) deciding that the way to make his mark in the world isnt doing well in school as his single mother Violetta (Angela Bassett) advocates but by selling drugs. Some years later Chris (now played by Jamal Woolard) learns the hard way that crime doesnt pay when he is arrested and sent to jail. While there he begins writing rap lyrics and once out of prison he embarks upon a career as a musician. One of the first people to believe in him is Sean ""Puffy"" Combs (Derek Luke) who shepherds him from a street-wise nobody into a major force in East Coast rap. Chris now known as ""Biggie Smalls"" has several high-energy love affairs including one with fellow rapper Lil Kim (Naturi Naughton) and another with singer Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) whom he marries. His visibility as a rising star pulls him into the so-called East Coast/West Coast rap battle which leads to his split from friend Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie). In the lead role Jamal Wooldard is effective. He has the requisite physical presence although there are times when his acting shows signs of stiffness. When it comes to the rap scenes however he comes alive shaking off any vestiges of woodenness like sawdust and bringing Biggie boldly to life. Derek Luke performs a chameleons trick to camouflage himself in Puff-Daddy/P. Diddy/Sean Combs colors. Angela Bassett stuck in the clichA(c)d ""famous persons mother"" role is underused but does what she can with the role. Naturi Naughton a former member of 3LW making her feature debut as an actress shows abundant energy and steals more than her share of scenes (although the real Lil Kim has openly condemned the movies representation of her). The most interesting instance of casting is the selection of Biggies real-life son with Faith Evans Christopher Jordan Wallace to play the school-age version of the character. Its stunt casting but it works because Wallace does a convincing job. In the final analysis Notorious is a fairly standard rags-to-riches story set in the world of rap music. A few of the notes may be different but the tune is familiar. While it provides us with a protagonist we can sympathize with it does little to make the uneducated understand why Biggie was important and what his contribution was to rap beyond representing the face of the East Coast faction. Theres a workmanlike quality to the movie and fans of the rapper will likely be pleased with (at a minimum) the soundtrack. For those who do not number themselves among the Notorious B.I.G.s song-buying public theres nothing about this production that makes it worth searching out. Its not bad enough to walk out on but neither is it good enough to walk into.

His 1997 death came two weeks before the release of his second album ""Life After Death"" which would make him the most popular rapper in the world. In private Wallace was playful and babied by his Jamaican mother a teacher who raised him by herself in Brooklyn. But as a rapper the Notorious B.I.G. seemed much older. His immense girth -- he stood 6 feet 3 and weighed more than 300 pounds -- gave him the command of any room he entered. His weathered voice was deep and silky as if it had been soaked in molasses. His lyrics about drug dealing were filled with an aged remorse. He even walked with a cane. Wallaces unsolved murder made him a tragic figure in hip-hop lore -- and the perfect story for a Hollywood biopic. Fans of the rapper -- and they are the ones who will enjoy ""Notorious"" most -- can rest easy knowing that the films producers nailed their lead in first-time actor Jamal Woolard himself a fledgling Brooklyn rapper. In fact Woolard is the best thing about ""Notorious."" Like Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"" he captures the mannerisms of a musician who moved like few others. Woolards Notorious B.I.G. is a big teddy bear his boyish grin and humor proving to be turn-ons to various lovers. But the rapper could also be physically imposing crashing through doors as he fought with his wife or mistress. While Woolard gives us a complicated character we want to watch director Georage Tillman Jr. doesnt necessarily create a world for him to inhabit. Tillmans last film was ""Men of Honor"" another biopic (about the first black Navy diver) that was burdened with formulaic cliches. Tillman seems trapped by them again. In hoping to cover as much ground as possible the filmmaker breaks down Wallaces life into a series of quick episodes forcing characters to talk in sound bites. He even uses those tired montages of magazine covers and headlines in place of real transitions. One moment Wallace is in prison for a drug bust the next hes signing a record deal. Before you know it hes at that Los Angeles street corner awaiting his death. There was a deep sorrow to Wallaces music. He wrote about suicide (an uncommon theme for rappers) naming his first album ""Ready to Die."" As he grows richer in the film his problems only persist. Some are his own fault (adultery pushes away all his lovers) while others are out of his control (a feud with former friend Tupac Shakur turns ugly). NOTORIOUS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for pervasive language strong sexuality including dialogue nudity and drug content. The last half of ""Notorious"" seems especially content with simply presenting the events of Wallaces life rather than exploring the ways they afflicted him. Its as if the filmmakers didnt trust Woolard to carry the emotional weight of Wallaces story. They should have.

Starring Jamal Woolard Derek Luke Anthony Mackie Angela Bassett Naturi Naughton Director George Tillman Jr. Running time 143 Release Opened Jan 16 2009  Editorial Review Those trailers on YouTube may look promising but dont believe the hype. ""Notorious"" a biopic about the life and death of Notorious B.I.G. feels like Biggies Wikipedia page reformatted for the big screen. No era of the iconic Brooklyn rappers 24 years goes untouched making a frustrating dash from the playground to the grave all in less than two hours. A young Christopher Wallace develops a fascination with the rhymes of Kurtis Blow and the flash of street hustlers. In high school Wallace played by 33-year-old newcomer Jamal ""Gravy"" Woolard has grown up to become a drug dealer himself raising the domestic pressure with his protective mother Voletta (played Angela Bassett). Cloyingly Biggie narrates his tale from the grave. Its a device that feels irksome and condescending. But the rookie actor compensates admirably on screen channeling the rappers imposing physicality. Woolard a Brooklyn rapper himself might be most convincing behind the microphone. During the films few musical interludes he respectably re-creates some of Biggies most indelible verses. Too bad hes rapping to such a lousy script. Penned by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Biggie biographer Cheo Hodari Coker the films dialogue feels trite. As Biggie courts singer Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) she asks the rapper ""Are you a bad guy trying to be good or a good guy trying to be bad?"" Its the million-dollar question ""Notorious"" completely fails to answer. After Biggies marriage its a race to his lifes tragic finish. His mothers breast cancer his infidelities his feud with rapper Tupac Shakur all go whizzing by offering little insight to the events that lead to his murder. Yet after so much melodrama ""Notorious"" ends with something real actual footage of the rappers funeral procession slowly weaving through the streets of Brooklyn. For any hip-hop fan who remembers the acute sorrow of that dreary March afternoon ""Notorious"" will feel like a colossal disappointment. -- Chris Richards (Jan. 16 2009) Contains pervasive language strong sexuality including dialogue and nudity and drug content.

""Notorious"" is an engaging enough biopic but it lacks depth and skirts the essential tragedy of Biggie.By Dan DeLuca Inquirer Music CriticPosted January 16 2009""Are you a bad guy trying to be good or a good guy trying to be bad?"" Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) asks Christopher Wallace also known as the Notorious B.I.G. in George Tillman Jr.s hip-hop biopic Notorious. Confronted with a query about his essential nature by his soon-to-be-spouse the crack dealer turned rapper played by newcomer Jamal Woolard admits hes not preoccupied with such moral issues. The idea is to rise up out of the hood whether by crime or by rhyme. ""Im just trying to make it"" he says. And with the assistance of impresario Sean Combs - Notorious exec producer then known as ""Puffy"" now as ""Diddy"" and played with panache by Derek Luke - Wallace makes it and spectacularly so. Notorious follows the oversized MC as he moves from adolescent honor student - played eerily by Christopher J. Wallace Biggies real-life son - to cold-eyed hustler willing to sell drugs to a pregnant crack addict to the precise and profane superstar rapper. In that latter role the real-life rapper B.I.G. spit out such memorably funk-flavored hits as ""Juicy"" and ""Hypnotize"" and became the foundation for the Bad Boy records empire that included Evans and his raunchy sidekick Lil Kim. Cast as the rival of Tupac Shakur in the East Coast-West Coast hip-hop rivalry of the mid-90s Biggie was shot dead in Los Angeles in March 1997 just six months after Shakur was killed in Las Vegas. Both shootings remain unsolved but Notorious wisely avoids getting bogged down in controversial allegations as to who was responsible for the death of the man also known as Biggie Smalls. Instead its a biopic that moves efficiently through the events of a truncated life - and avoids the dull third act of so many music films that have to chronicle a superstars long slow decline. With music movies its better to burn out than fade away. As an unknown charged with embodying one of the most beloved figures in hip-hop Woolard acquits himself ably if unspectacularly. He holds his own with more seasoned actors like Luke Anthony Mackie (who emphasizes Shakurs explosive temper) and Angela Bassett who turns in a largely accent-free performance as Wallaces Jamaican-born mother Voletta and delivers the movies most amusing sound bite ""What kind of grown man calls himself Puffy?"" In Notorious Wallace can be a chair-throwing menacing figure even when hes looking harmless in a fuchsia sweater. And hes nobodys idea of a trustworthy paramour - the 350-pound lothario fails to be true to Evans his high school sweetheart Jan (Julia Pace Mitchell) the mother of his first child or Kim whom Naturi Naughton plays with appropriate spunk. But mainly Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Cokers script depicts Biggie as a preternaturally talented teddy bear a product of the streets whos a natural-born charmer whether hes flirting with Evans or telling his entourage ""I need some Pepsi and more weed"" to come up with inspired rhymes in the studio. Its an engaging enough story crisply told and the lip-synced music scenes in the studio and on stage are brought off in high style. Notorious is an efficient biopic and a celebratory exercise in nostalgia for hip-hop fans of a certain age. But in part because Woolard struggles to convey Wallaces interior life it falls short as either an in-depth character study or the genuine tragedy it could have been considering its about the tragic and unnecessary early deaths of not one but two of the most talented artists of the 1990s.Contact music critic Dan DeLuca at 215-854-5628 or ddelucaphillynews.com.

We get to see the childhood of nerdy young Christopher Wallace before he gains success in the hip-hop world as Notorious B.I.G. There are brushes with the law flings with women and drugs everywhere you look. Once fame hits we even get the obligatory montage that includes close-ups of his records climbing the Billboard charts. Granted the filmmakers tell us that everything that happened in the brief life of B.I.G. aka Biggie Smalls is true but the movie doesnt make you care about any of it. Biggie is presented as a blank slate. He starts dealing drugs as a child because he likes money; other than that insight we get no clue as to what makes this music icon tick. Jamal Woolard making his screen debut as Biggie has a relaxed charm but doesnt project much beyond that. Biggie is a cipher in his hands. The philandering and the sudden bursts of temper dont seem out of character because there isnt much character on-screen. A stronger actor might have helped tie things together. Other performances are fine. Angela Bassett is solid as Biggies protective mother although her characters Jamaican accent comes and goes. Derek Luke does a smooth job capturing Sean ""Puffy"" Combs charisma and Antonique Smith nails Faith Evans mix of brashness and vulnerability. Director George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food) creates some exciting musical sequences but most of the dramatic moments cant transcend the over-familiarity of the story. Its not simply from the public being exposed to Biggies life through the media but in the way the script fails to make the story fresh. Biggie was murdered in 1997 in Los Angeles. He was just 24. The movie in its final moments uses footage from the real funeral procession intercut with actors. The shots of the real-life mourners pack an emotional wallop thats missing from the rest of the movie. They also emphasize the dramatic deficiencies that seem to dominate Notorious.

"Notorious reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Notorious reviewed. Notorious reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 15 2009 1228 PM Notorious Biggie on the big screen. By Dana Stevens Click here to read Jody Rosens appreciation of Biggie Smalls. Jamal Woolard as Biggie Smalls A few months ago when Cadillac Records came out I wrote in defense of the biopic. Why I asked has this genre had so much trouble earning the artistic respect thats long been extended to other pop genres from detective stories to superhero films? Notorious a paint-by-numbers account of the too-short life of rapper Christopher Wallace (aka Biggie Smalls aka the Notorious B.I.G.) is a two-hour-long rebuttal to my plea for biopic cred. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Like a drunk on a bender Notorious seems to have given up even trying to moderate its dependence on cliche. The director George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food Men of Honor) begins the film with Biggies 1997 death in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles rewinds to Biggies childhood in Brooklyn N.Y. then works his way back through time to the same death scene--thus draining all possible suspense from what was already a foregone conclusion. As the rapper hits his stride Billboard chart listings loom in close-up and a series of magazine covers tracks his ascent from niche to mainstream culture. (These magazine-themed success montages always make me want to hum ""Go Tootsie go"") And on not one but two occasions Biggie (Jamal Woolard) and his producer and mentor Sean ""Puffy"" Combs (Derek Luke) assure each other solemnly that ""you cant change the world until you change yourself."" (Puffy--I mean P. Diddy or Diddy or possibly Scrum-Diddily-Umptious--was the movies executive producer which means that scenes representing him are scrupulously humor-free.) Notorious nonetheless generates a lot of good will for its subject thanks almost entirely to its star 32-year-old Brooklyn rapper Jamal Woolard (hip-hop name Gravy). Woolard answered an open casting call for performers who not only resembled the 6-foot-3 300-plus pound rap legend but could emulate his storied ""flow"" of rapid-fire multisyllabic rhymes. Untrained as an actor Woolard underwent an intensive apprenticeship with choreographers and vocal coaches and gained 45 pounds for the role. But the best thing he brings to the part is something that cant be learned; Woolards got swagger that indefinable here-comes-trouble charisma that helped make Biggie the unrivaled king of 90s East Coast rap. By all accounts Biggie also shared Woolards talent for wheedling affection from a skeptical audience both off- and onstage. (A scene in which he wins over a restless college crowd with the bravura boast ""Party and Bullshit"" is a musical high point.) The Christopher Wallace this movie shows us is not such a swell guy He deals crack to a pregnant woman; ignores his first out-of-wedlock daughter when his second child by another woman comes along; and runs out on his mother Voletta (Angela Bassett) after she receives a cancer diagnosis. But even after the movie shows us what happens when Biggies charm runs dry with his wife Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) were expected to keep forgiving him ourselves. Again Woolards natural warmth as an actor makes this easy enough to do. But the screenwriters Reggie Rock Bythewood and Biggies biographer Cheo Hodari Coker can never decide whether theyre telling a dark morality tale (about a man brought low by his own choices who reforms just as his lifestyle catches up with him) or a simpler story of unalloyed triumph cut short by violence. Advertisement Its rare that the only name actor in a cast of unknowns gives the worst performance of the bunch. But Angela Bassett who was sensational as Tina Turner in Whats Love Got To Do With It? (a music biopic that like Cadillac Records transcended the genre) is uncharacteristically bad as Voletta Wallace Biggies staunchly noble mother (made stauncher and more noble no doubt by the real-life Voletta Wallaces close involvement with the movie). Her vague stab at a Jamaican accent soon gives way to standardized Hollywood diction and her scenes with Woolard feel devoid of specificity; shes a generic saint not a harried working woman with a gifted but reckless son. The closing voice-over in which Bassett-as-Wallace salutes her sons memory over real footage of Biggies funeral procession in Bed-Stuy rings particularly false and ends the movie on a cloyingly hagiographic note--a tone that blends strangely with the sound of Biggies voice on a fans boom box rapping about m-fers and hos. Anthony Mackie as Biggies West Coast rival Tupac Shakur is given little to do but stand around looking reasonably Tupac-like in a few brief scenes (and for viewers not schooled in the lore of the Biggie/Tupac feud a scene in which Tupac is shot and wounded in the lobby of Puffys studio will be near-incomprehensible). Naturi Naughton a performer as tiny and as potent as a hand grenade plays the street-smart girl whom Biggie picks up and helps refashion into the X-rated rap star Lil Kim. (The movies portrait of the oft-naked rapper as an easily offended diva has er offended real-life diva Lil Kim.) And in a poignant bit of casting Biggie is played as a child by the rappers real-life son Christopher Jordan Wallace. As for the still-unresolved questions of who killed Biggie and Tupac (or for that matter what the origin of their quarrel was in the first place) the movie remains mum--probably a good choice for both narrative and legal reasons. In the end the only evidence of Biggies artistry the movie provides is the music and to the directors credit he shows Woolard performing several of the rappers hits in their entirety. Still the best way to remember Biggie Smalls is to listen to ""Juicy"" or ""Things Done Changed"" or any of the virtuosic autobiographical raps in which Christopher Wallace paints his own world with more immediacy and wit than Notorious ever manages to muster.

Cast as the imperious-on-the-outside haunted-on-the-inside rapper who grows up in the 80s in the hustlers paradise of Brooklyns Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood Woolard swaggers down the street like a mountainous gangsta John Wayne and he doesnt just stand tall. He looms imposing himself on each encounter. In the movies and pop music too overweight people are usually outsize clowns but the real Biggie used his bulk (300 pounds) height (he was 6 foot 3) and merciless dead-end stare to cultivate a larger-than-life presence of theatrical power the image of a clown?turned?doughboy badass. That image eventually turned against him and he became a martyr killed in a drive-by shooting in 1997 at 24. ? Notorious is a luridly unapologetic trip through the violence hunger verbal bravado and money fever of the hip-hop world which it views as both liberating and destructive ? (often for the same reasons). Dressed in a pin-striped suit and bowler hat Woolard does an uncanny impersonation of the Biggie ? who strutted on stage like some mack daddy from the 70s. Look closer though and that fleshy face might belong to a giant pouting baby. Woolards Biggie comes on like a thug with a voice commandingly low and grumbly but theres a twinkle ? in his eye a look that says Im a playa whos playing you. Hes a real crook who becomes a put-on crook who is then reborn through a rap style ? so incendiary its like spontaneous combustion into a superhero. Hip-hop feeds on mythology but ? Notorious sticks close to the details and the hell-bent spirit of Biggies life. Ignoring the admonitions of his Jamaican-born mother (Angela ? Bassett) he starts to sell crack in his teens when hes still boyish friendly Christopher Wallace going up to a roof to change out of his school duds and into his dealers paraphernalia (white sneakers gold medallion handgun). The director George ? Tillman Jr. (Soul Food) catches us up in the excitement that seduces a ? kid into the hustlers life yet the film doesnt glamorize it. Chris learns his lesson the hard way -- he goes to prison -- and when he hooks up with the budding impresario Sean ""Puffy"" Combs (Derek Luke) Notorious turns into a funky capitalist message movie. Biggie craves stardom as freedom as his one ticket out of the inner city. When he does the hedonist anthem ""Party and Bulls--"" at a concert he flips the meaning of the lyrics (based on a song by the Last Poets) so that a critique of nihilism becomes a salute to it and its such an intoxicating number whod resist? Biggie makes up a lot of his dark smoky raps on the spot. He uses his words too to ? seduce winning over a slew of women like the blond soul diva Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) whom he marries and Kimberly Jones (Naturi Naughton) whom he makes ? over into the ferocious skin-flashing novelty act Lil Kim. At first they see a big fat man acting like a sex symbol. But the movie teases out the glee in Biggie -- hes like a kid with a supersize sly grin cracking up at his own self-confidence. Thats how he gets to be a sex symbol. Biggie treats his women like a harem and he thinks that makes him a man. Does it or is he just caught up in the pathology of what he thinks a man is? Thats the question that propels Woolards remarkable performance. Notorious has a fascinating trajectory but certain episodes leave you wanting. The film would have been stronger if Biggies pop-star squeezes were as fully realized as the women in Ray and Anthony Mackie as Tupac Shakur lacks Tupacs electrifying snakish charm. Biggie and Tupac become pals (in underwritten scenes) then mortal enemies and the films re-creation of the East Coast?West Coast rap war while entertaining is too simplistic. As presented the entire feud spiraled out of ? Tupacs paranoia his misguided belief that Biggie put a hit out on him. But why did Tupac think that in the first place? And what did these two say to each other when no one was looking? Notorious makes the death of Biggie Smalls look like a tragic mistake instead of the outgrowth of a culture devoted to selling the fantasy of whos the biggest man.

Both are rigorous and respectable biographies of trailblazers but Notorious despite its bigger-than-life subject and habit of dripping sex sweat at the most unexpected moments is rather square.Thats probably because its also incomplete. To tell the life of Christopher Wallace--the Notorious B.I.G. Biggie Smalls Big Poppa Chrissy-poo to his mother Voletta--is to also deal with his death still an unsolved murder nearly 12 years after he was gunned down while driving away from the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. There are two mysteries of course Who killed Biggie and who six months earlier killed his friend-turned-foe Tupac Shakur? Names have been named allegedly dirty cops called out newspapers and their writers damned and discredited for posting false information and lawsuits filed and fed upon as they made further nastier allegations. But so far no official suspects; the story ends in a trail of ellipses.Tillman perhaps rightly so has no interest in walking through that minefield. Nick Broomfield documentarian and self-promoting provocateur already visited that treacherous territory in his 2002 Biggie and Tupac and only barely survived intact (artistically at least). Tillman instead revisits the well-chronicled taking us from near-birth to afterlife--from the picked-on grade-schooler to the career in crack to the conquering hero from the mean streets rendered mythical in death.There are no spoilers or surprises contained herein. Notorious ends precisely where you expect it to at the March 1997 funeral procession through the streets of Bed-Stuy packed with boys in blue sent to keep the peace. New York magazine had it right in its review of Biggie biographer Cheo Hodari Coker and Reggie Rock Bythewoods screenplay last February ""Its basically the screenplay adaptation of Biggies Wikipedia entry.""Biggies played by Jamal Woolard known as rapper Gravy who does a respectably credible impersonation. It helps that hes a first-time actor; Woolards not just another famous face playing Hollywood Halloween dress-up like some of his castmates. Hes imposing but also gentle a bastard but also an angel and he renders a young Chris Wallaces dreams almost tangible. The anguish commingled with the ambition feels genuine. Especially authentic are Woolards early scenes with Voletta a Jamaican immigrant (Angela Bassett) abandoned by her husband. For a while Notorious is less biopic than an engaging heartbreaking small-scale drama about a lost little boy who wants to make his mom proud but keeps breaking her heart.But Tillman doesnt have time to dwell on the nobody Chris whos too small-fry for the big-time Biggie story for which the audience has paid its hard-earned. He fast-forwards instead to the glossy glamorous life--the fuck-the-world photo-ops with Tupac (Anthony Mackie) before things went bad following a shooting at a studio; the change-the-world meetings with Puff Daddy (Derek Luke); the steamy trysts with Lil Kim (Naturi Naughton) and Faith Evans (Antonique Smith); and the nasty run-ins with Suge Knight (Sean Ringgold). The movie turns into a parade of bold-faced names--a hip-hop stunt-cast episode of Entourage but with a decidedly tragic ending.Notorious doesnt wash away Biggies sins--the dealing (to a pregnant woman even) the screwing around the prison time. But it absolves him of them too easily by having Biggie narrate from the grave; as every deeds done its explained away by a ghost spouting hindsight wisdom. Such is to be expected from the authorized biography--Notorious after all was produced by Voletta and executive produced by Sean Combs who do just enough to burnish the legend without tarnishing it. Just buy the records; thats the point of this infomercial anyhow.

Skim off all the bling and ""Notorious"" is a rock-solid biopic with a foolproof rise-and-fall storyline and a warmly nuanced performance by Jamal Woolard as iconic rapper Christopher Wallace -- aka Biggie Smalls aka the Notorious B.I.G. Less interested in the particulars of Smalls 1997 slaying than in his growth and influence as an artist the pic has a propulsive narrative drive. Although the beat-heavy Fox Searchlight release will command a rap-centric fan base it should also hip-hop its way across demographic lines. Helmer George Tillman Jr. seems partial to the incongruous flourish and treats Wallaces assassination as though it were the most significant blow to literature since the death of Keats. At the same time ""Notorious"" might be considered the third in an unofficial trilogy on late 20th-century American popular music -- the first two being ""Bird"" and ""Cadillac Records."" Woolard might have starred in all of them As the decidedly un-svelte Smalls he cuts a figure at once sympathetic comic deceptively charming and occasionally cunning. Hes an unlikely leading man but then Smalls was an unlikely sex symbol. Its a good fit and Woolard owns the movie. The story begins with young Christophers nerdy upbringing in Brooklyn as the child of a single striving mother Voletta Wallace (Angela Bassett). (That Mom calls him ""Chrissie-poo"" wont do much for Wallaces gansta legacy.) Pic then moves on to his crack-dealing gun possession prison time and jail-cell evolution into the baddest rapper in Brooklyn. An alliance with fledgling music mogul Sean Combs (Derek Luke) leads to a record deal; a friendship with West Coast colleague Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie) turns sour and segues into fatal confrontations. But a sense of doom never really permeates ""Notorious"" which is far more concerned with one artists development demons and self-realization. While Bassett isnt given sufficient material to show her usual depth the supporting cast is solid overall -- notably Naturi Naughton and Antonique Smith as Lil Kim and Faith Evans respectively the principal women in Smalls life. Mackie comes close to stealing every scene hes in his Shakur emitting a natural incandescence that contrasts with Biggies stolid darkness. The script by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker is often too weighted with expository luggage (""My father died hustling on these streets when I was 2 years old"" Combs says). The few times the social implications of the story are overplayed only serve to show how frequently subtle the movie really is. With Voletta Wallace and Sean Combs among the producers of ""Notorious"" its perhaps no surprise that their characters are portrayed as staunchly noble and in Wallaces case eminently self-sacrificing. And given the cloud that continues to shadow the Biggie-Tupac feud one might expect the film to imply guilt or conspiracies. But with the exception of the 1994 robbery in which Tupac was shot (and which he blamed on Biggie and Co.) the film takes a hands-off approach to the double murders and the venomous East Coast-West Coast rap war that generated so much ink and distraction toward the ends of the two stars lives. The question of who was behind the murders is left largely to speculation and the lack of danger in all this seems oddly antithetical to the image Biggie and Tupac left behind. But as Tillman wants to show that image was largely just marketing -- a mask for the human story he has effectively unearthed from its tabloid interment. Production values are tops although sometimes executed with a heavy hand. Smalls is played in the pics early scenes by his and Evans son Christopher Jordan Wallace.

The Notorious B.I.G. a.k.a. Biggie Smalls a.k.a. Biggie) still managed to stun unsettle and move me. Its been 11 years since the still-unsolved murder of the hip-hop icon and the film does a wonderful job of revisiting that dangerous yet creatively rich time in music history. For a hip-hop fiend like me its a bittersweet journey to the days when the Cristal was overflowing the bling was blinding and the performers burned brightly--but briefly. (Article continued below...)The film begins with Wallace as a Catholic-school honor student (portrayed deftly if a bit eerily by his son Christopher Wallace Jr.) who gets teased because of his dark skin and his weight. Despite the best efforts of his mother (Angela Bassett) the teenage Biggie ultimately gives in to the kind of peer pressure that turns into an all-too-familiar inner-city tale. He begins to deal drugs becomes a top crack distributor and ends up in prison where he focuses on his blossoming rhyming and writing skills. Once he gets out Wallace (played by Jamal Woolard as an adult) competes in freestyle rap competitions on Brooklyn street corners and comes to the attention of a guy who ""knows motherf---kers who know motherf---kers"" who introduce him to a young producer named Sean (Puffy) Combs (Derek Luke). Watching the actors lip-sync to ""Big Poppa and ""Juicy onstage made me still want to bust a move some 10 years later. Along the way Wallace hooks up with other hip-hop royalty including Kimberly Jones who later becomes Lil Kim. As I watched their dysfunctional partnership on screen I couldnt help hoping that the end could somehow be different for the Queen Bee even as I flashed back to the conversations wed had when she spoke sadly of trying to please Wallace by undergoing plastic surgery to fit his beauty ideal.Then theres Tupac. ""Notorious goes to great lengths to emphasize the friendship Tupac Shakur and Wallace shared before bad blood tainted not just their relationship but the entire rap community. Shakur (Anthony Mackie) comes across as the charming and moody man he was initially celebrating the success of Wallaces first album and giving him tips on dealing with the downside of fame. But a tumultuous marriage to singer Faith Evans financial responsibilities and his mothers bout with breast cancer all caused Wallaces world to falter. It completely implodes when Shakur is shot and injured in the lobby of a New York record studio and he accuses Smalls (and Combs) of planning it. Seeing Wallaces anguish as Shakur casts him as the bad guy finally gives his fans some insight into the internal turmoil he suffered toward the end of his life. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The rest of the film follows the events and characters (the bicoastal rivalries the gangs and the records that shared it all with fans) that eventually saw both Shakur and Wallace shot and killed within six months of each other. Smartly the writers do not delve into suspicions of who killed Wallace; the long and byzantine murder investigation could be its own movie. Instead ""Notorious"" highlights a time when hip-hop was arguably at the top of the pop-culture food chain and not coincidentally demonstrates why that moment passed with the passing of Wallace and Shakur. That becomes even clearer in the final scene which features actual footage of Wallaces open hearse being driven through the crowded cheer- and tear-filled streets of Brooklyn. Watching ""Notorious was like attending a 10-year high-school reunion and reliving the good old days when the future seemed so bright.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?
