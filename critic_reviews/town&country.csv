(New Line) Theres a telling scene in ""Town amp; Country"" the anemic new (actually its more like two years old but whos counting?) sex farce from director Peter ""Funny Bones"" Chelsom. In it Porter and Ellie Stoddard an upscale architect and his designer wife played by Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton are discussing their 25-year marriage (okay a number of scenes fit that description in this all-too-talky comedy). Anyway in the background architect Philip Johnson can be glimpsed on TV being interviewed by Charlie Rose where according to Ellie hes expounding on his philosophy that architecture or all art for that matter should be a mixture of the strange and the familiar. I think the comment is also supposed to allude to sex (there are lots of double entendres here) but it might just as easily apply to the film.The problem is Theres too much familiar and not enough strange. Put another way theres too much ""town"" and not enough ""country."" In town (Manhattan where else?) Porter Ellie and best friends Griffin and Mona (Garry Shandling and Goldie Hawn) are fine upstanding couples who seem to have great marriages or at least marriages that work (how boring). In the country however (meaning one of the numerous homes they unwind in outside the city) all hell breaks loose. First Griffin has an affair - with a red-headed male transvestite no less. Then Porter feeling left out has a one- or two-night-stand with a comely cellist (Nastassja Kinski). Then Mona finds out about Griffin and winds up in the sack with Porter by way of consolation. Then Ellie finds out about the cellist and Porter flies off with Griffin to Sun Valley Idaho where Porter almost gets involved with a flighty heiress (Andie MacDowell) and a convenience store clerk (Jenna Elfman). Amid all this theres a lot of hiding in closets falling out of bed hanging outside windows jumping up with your fly undone and ducking in and out of slamming doors. And thats the familiar part. Theres nothing new in all that that hasnt been seen since French playwright Georges Feydeau penned ""A Flea in Her Ear"" in 1907. Where ""Town amp; Country"" gets really good and weird - and I do mean good - is only after about an hour into it in deepest darkest Idaho. There Porter tries to hook up with Eugenie (MacDowell) and she takes him to meet her parents played by Charlton Heston and Marian Seldes. Daddy an old pal of Ernest Hemingways is a bit overprotective of his princess not to mention something of a gun nut (nice casting touch that). Mommy is a shrewish and foul-mouthed biddy in a balky motorized wheelchair. Eugenie who makes no bones about her designs on Porter announces ""I love to [expletive] architects"" then takes him to the same bed she slept in as a child where she proceeds to pretend that her stuffed animals (named something like Floppy and Stiffy) are ""doing it."" Talk about strange - and by the way how about some more of that? Alas the movie co-written by Michael Laughlin and Buck Henry (who also cameos as a divorce lawyer) all too soon reverts to its tired high jinks of marital infidelity and the old hoo-hah about working it out and ""Youre the only woman I ever really loved"" and . . . oh can it. Enough with the trials and tribulations of Porter and Griffin and Mona and Ellie I dont really like these arrogant rich people with their myriad homes and lily-white neighbors and first names that sound like last names. Nothing they can say or do can make me care whether they stay together or split up or turn gay. Give me Floppy and Stiffy and Eugenie any day.""Town amp; Country"" (R 104 minutes) - Contains obscenity partial nudity and a couple of relatively discreet sex scenes.

(New Line) ""Town amp; Country"" feels like a Woody Allen movie on steroids. It means to study the mores and couplings of upscale New Yorkers but the whole thing is too big too loud too expensive and has too much Diane Keaton. It also proves an immutable movie rule Its impossible to empathize with people who live in better houses than you do. And since Warren Beattys Porter Stoddard has two houses that are better than yours the rule goes double. He has a sprawling killer-decorated Park Avenue apartment so vast it has room for wifeys business and his two kids and their lovers as well as the live-in maid and her lover (everybodys sophisticated see); and he has a Nantucket-shingled summer mansion in East Hampton overlooking the hilly dunes the flawless beach and the sparkly sea. Thats the good news. The bad news His missus is Keaton. Well of course Porter isnt married to Diane Keaton the woman who is almost certainly delightful and wise; hes married to Ellie Stoddard decorator extraordinaire and pious moral center of the movie. Alas thats Diane Keaton the actress who is eternally braying nattering giggling an Annie Hall in search of an Alvy Singer. Porter has a problem even beyond his wifes verbal tics and twitches. This one is also somewhat difficult to empathize with particularly if you happen to be me. Women keep throwing themselves at him and he finally slips and decides to catch one a cellist played by Nastassja Kinski who smiles at him during a concert. The movie is so lame in its level of invention that it cant document the verbal foreplay that precedes the bedding; it cuts from that smile to post-coital languor and regret. The others who go bonkers at exposure to Porters plasticized stretched-taut skin are Jenna Elfman Goldie Hawn and Andie MacDowell - not a bad trifecta for a 64-year-old movie star but somewhat surprising for a 64-year-old architect. What has turned Porter toward the way of all flesh not attached to his wife? The movie is unclear on this issue as it is on all issues of motive (which is why it makes so little sense) but it appears to be the collapse of his best friends marriage. Griffin (Garry Shandling) a swanky East Side antiques dealer is caught in flagrante by his wife Mona (Hawn). But Mona is so shocked she doesnt track the details and misses a key fact about the motel tryst she witnesses and her husbands true (if unconvincing) nature. She begins the divorce dance. Porter lectures Griffin on the stupidity of his ways; within 48 hours hes in the sack with Kinskis Alex. So ""Town amp; Country"" is essentially a farce on the theme of male folly built around a single comic device to continually contrive grotesque circumstances for its dignified retirement-age hero to negotiate. But rarely is the humor situational or ironic or particularly witty; far too frequently it devolves to the crudest kind of physical stuff. If youve ever longed to see a 64-year-old man rabbit-hop up the stairs with his pants around his ankles heres your chance. The plot feels arbitrary and seems driven to invent new places for its protagonists to go as if to justify a budget on which Woody Allen could have made six much better films. We open in Paris (the two couples have private-jetted over and you may be forgiven if you silently request that the plane please blow up); then unexpectedly were in plantation-house kudzu-cloaked Mississippi where for unfathomable reasons Ellie has sent Porter with the recently separated and distraught Mona and duh guess what happens? The longest section is New York Citys high end and East Hamptons higher end; theres an interlude in Sun Valley where Charlton Heston gets one of the few comic turns in his career and retires the 2001 Good Sport Award by playing a gun-happy macho nut case. Some will say it isnt acting but I would say Heston is the best thing in the movie. Nobody else could be said to deliver much of a performance. Beatty plays with one eyebrow cocked in mild befuddlement so consistently you begin to suspect the plastic surgeon made a mistake and pinned it that way. Keaton is...Oh the humanity the humanity As for Shandling and Hawn they are Shandling and Hawn in well-fitted but now well-worn roles he smarmy she ditzy. Elfman and MacDowell are in pointlessly thin roles as essentially plot gambits to get Beatty into surrealistic circumstances such as the Sun Valley Halloween party that finds him in a bear suit or worse the architects award ceremony where he is stalked by the NRA president with an elephant gun. The movie is annoyingly unrigorous in its examination of marriage complexities. It invests all moral authority in the supposedly perfect Ellie even while observing her chronic career-consumption one symptom of which is her utter uninterest in Porter or his life. Then she has the gall to be astounded when she discovers he has yielded to temptation? ""Town amp; Country"" was written by Michael Laughlin and Buck Henry and directed by Peter Chelsom and you have to wonder if any of them have ever been married. They seem to feel qualified to comment on its torturous paradoxes without ever convincing you theyve experienced it. As most adults either know or learn its never black and white.""Town amp; Country"" (107 minutes) is rated R for heavy sexual innuendo and occasional glimpses of flesh.

Publicity Photo Goldie Hawn plays Mona and Warren Beatty stars as Porter in the romantic comedy ""Town and Country. Publicity Photo Skip This Town / Beattys disjointed vanity project plays like bad farce 1 / 1 Back to Gallery TOWN AND COUNTRY Romantic comedy. Starring Warren Beatty Diane Keaton Goldie Hawn Garry Shandling. Directed by Peter Chelsom. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Reports of Armageddon approaching upon the release of ""Town and Country"" are grossly exaggerated. The movies not bad enough to be world-ending merely clumsy enough to make the offending studio exec clean out his desk -- which hes already done. Now three years and 13 release dates later America can sit back and puzzle over the resulting product a Warren Beatty-led neurotic jamboree ignited by a spree of marital infidelities midlife crises and juvenile digressions. This romantic-comic mixed bag reunites Beatty with old co-stars Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn and with writer Buck Henry who tried to fix the leaky jokes. Nice try. But conversations end before theyve begun and once they get going never go anywhere. Still what do you want from a movie that started production without a script? In every way a Hydra-like vanity project with mirrors where the heads should be the film plays like a bad French sex farce - - or really well-lit dinner theater depending on whether you take your Warren Beatty comedies with multiplex nachos. A COUPLE OF ARCHITECTS Beatty plays Porter Stoddard to Keatons Ellie Stoddard. Together theyre the Bill and Hillary of New York architecture with 25 years of marriage they call into question when their best friends Mona and Griffin (Hawn and Garry Shandling) file for divorce. Mona catches Griffin cheating. Failing to realize that shes married to a man played by Warren Beatty Ellie dispatches Porter to comfort the aching enraged Mona on a trip to a dilapidated Southern manor the site of her new lease on life. Of course he winds up beneath her. And this is after Porters bedded a breezy Euro cellist (Nastassja Kinski) and flirted with the enjoyably direct lady (Andie MacDowell) across from him on the flight south. At its best theres a ruthless selfish almost ugly streak running through this movie. Some of it surfaces between Keaton and Hawn -- directed by Hawns secretive destructive Mona toward Ellie who turns to her friend suspicious that Porter is cheating. SYMPATHETIC SHREW In the films most exuberant sequence Hawn does some swell priority- juggling as Ellie then Griffin encroach on Monas second tryst with Porter. Hawns the only comedian I know who can win sympathy for a shrew this reckless and besieged all while reminding you that her posterior is still tighter than a single scene in this movie. Shes ditched though for a trip the freshly divorced Porter takes with Griffin to Sun Valley. Here things wind down to a goofy ""Eyes Wide Shut"" redux in which Beatty and Shandling attend a Halloween fete (as a bear and Elvis or Evel Knievel respectively) with Jenna Elfman as their date. She got game and she pretty much walks off with this passage. Ditto for dame of the American stage Marian Seldes who deliriously spins around in a mechanical wheelchair and hurls yummy vulgarities at anyone within earshot. Both Seldes and Elfmans are garden-variety petty thefts but theyre inspired enough to rinse away the searching plotless psyche-less mediocrity. NOT THE RIGHT DIRECTOR Was Peter Chelsom (""Funny Bones"" ""The Mighty"") ever the right man to direct this? Probably not. The film is excursive and disjointed enough to suggest any number of directors at any time. Its got Woody Allen bookends (complete with Django Reinhardt strumming over the opening titles) a Paul Mazursky middle and a stupendously odd Luis Bunuel interlude starring Seldes and a maniacally self-parodic Charlton Heston as MacDowells parents. Its all Chelsom or whoever was on final-cut duty can do to bring the pastiche in for a vaguely gratifying landing. Advisory This film contains sexual situations and foul language.

His immediate sunny reaction is to cry out ""Wheres the pony?"" If theres a room full of horse dung he figures there must be a pony somewhere. The same can be said for ""Town amp; Country."" With all that talent on screen -- Warren Beatty Goldie Hawn Diane Keaton and Garry Shandling share billing -- there must be a movie in there somewhere. There isnt. This troubled film has been grist for Hollywoods gossip mill for years. Shot in the summer of 1998 with an original release date of April 1999 the films unveiling was moved 11 times before finally being set to open on Friday. Such delays do not bode well. Add the fact that the studio is not doing a full-blown press day offering interviews with the stars and the movies prospects look quite bleak before opening credits appear. Not bad -- or good Ultimately ""Town amp; Country"" underlines Hollywoods greatest weakness and biggest secret Nobody can guarantee results when it comes to what will actually transfer from script to screen no matter how many big names have been thrown into the mix. There are hundreds of variables involved since filmmaking is such a collaborative activity. Thats not to say ""Town amp; Country"" is a hideous movie; it isnt. Beatty has not made another ""Ishtar"" (1987) nor is Hawn in another ""Housesitter"" (1992). Still with a budget of somewhere between 80 million and 120 million (the amount depends on which pundit is talking since the studio wont say how much money it threw at the film) and a script by Buck Henry (along with Michael Laughlin) it should have been a lot better movie than it turned out to be. And let us not forget the high-wattage star power that should have elevated this film. The result is a series of amusing vignettes all strung together without a shred of momentum pacing dramatic (or comedic) tension all combined with a complete lack of direction by Peter Chelsom. The editing is haphazard many of the shots are out of focus (especially the filtered images of the aging Beatty who looks as if linoleum were laid in front of the lens every time he stepped into view) and the whole thing feels like it was made by a committee -- which was probably the case.

This expensive coarse and unfunny romantic comedy stars Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton as a rich architect and his well-designed wife celebrating 25 years of smugly happy marriage with their best friends played by Garry Shandling and Goldie Hawn. Happiness doesnt preclude extramarital itch however and each man scratches in his own ""amusing"" way. The architects dalliances include a free-spirited cellist (Nastassja Kinski) and a sex-hungry psychologically unstable heiress (Andie MacDowell) with a creepy attachment to her stuffed animal collection and her gun-toting father (Charlton Heston undoing anything he says in defense of the NRA). Directed with a white flag of surrender by Peter Chelsom (Hear My Song) these characters are mannequins in search of hearts brains and courage. Also dramatic incentives a decent plot and dialogue thats more than a string of punchlines.
